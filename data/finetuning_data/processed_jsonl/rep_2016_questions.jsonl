Its deeply humbling for me to be here, to be surrounded by my  my wonderful family. And, Senator Kaine, its an honor to be here with you, as well. And I just  I also want to say  I want to say thanks to everyone thats looking in tonight, who understands what an enormously important time this is in the life of our nation. For the last seven-and-a-half years, weve seen Americas place in the world weakened. Weve seen an economy stifled by more taxes, more regulation, a war on coal, and a failing health care reform come to be known as Obamacare, and the American people know that we need to make a change. And so I want to thank all of you for being  being with us tonight. I also want to thank Donald Trump for making that call and inviting us to be a part of this ticket. I have to tell you, Im a  Im a small-town boy from a place not too different from Farmville. I grew up with a cornfield in my backyard. My grandfather had immigrated to this country when he was about my sons age. My mom and dad built a  everything that matters in a small town in Southern Indiana. They built a family and  and a good name and a business. And they raised a family. And I dreamed some day of representing my home town in Washington, D.C., but I  honestly, Elaine, I never imagined  never imagined Id have the opportunity to be governor of the state that I love, let alone be sitting at a table like this in this kind of a position. So to answer your question, I would say I  I would hope that if  if the responsibility ever fell to me in this role, that I would meet it with the way that Im going to meet the responsibility should I be elected vice president of the United States. And thats to bring a lifetime of experience, a lifetime growing up in a small town, a lifetime where Ive served in the Congress of the United States, where  where Ive led a state that works in the great state of Indiana, and whatever other responsibilities might follow from this, I  I would hope and, frankly, I would pray to be able to meet that moment with that  that lifetime of experience."}]}

I mean, Im very proud of the fact that  I come from a state that works. The state of Indiana has balanced budgets. We cut taxes, weve made record investments in education and in infrastructure, and I still finish my term with $2 billion in the bank. Thats a little bit different than when Senator Kaine was governor here in Virginia. He actually  he actually tried to raise taxes by about $4 billion. He left his state about $2 billion in the hole. In the state of Indiana, weve cut unemployment in half; unemployment doubled when he was governor. But I think hes a very fitting running mate for Hillary Clinton, because in the wake of a season where American families are struggling in this economy under the weight of higher taxes and Obamacare and the war on coal and the stifling avalanche of regulation coming out of this administration, Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine want more of the same. It really is remarkable that they actually are advocating a trillion dollars in tax increases, which I get that. You tried to raise taxes here in Virginia and were unsuccessful. But a trillion dollars in tax increases, more regulation, more of the same war on coal, and more of Obamacare that now even former President Bill Clinton calls Obamacare a crazy plan. But Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine want to build on Obamacare. They want to expand it into a single-payer program. And for all the world, Hillary Clinton just thinks Obamacare is a good start. Look, Donald Trump and I have a plan to get this economy moving again just the way that it worked in the 1980s, just the way it worked in the 1960s, and that is by lowering taxes across the board for working families, small businesses and family farms, ending the war on coal that is hurting jobs and hurting this economy even here in Virginia, repealing Obamacare lock, stock, and barrel, and repealing all of the executive orders that Barack Obama has signed that are stifling economic growth in this economy. We can get America moving again. Put on top of that the kind of trade deals thatll put the American worker first, and youve got a prescription for real growth. And when you get the economy growing, Elaine, thats when you can deal with the national debt. When we get back to 3.5 percent to 4 percent growth with Donald Trumps plan will do, then were going to have the resources to meet our nations needs at home and abroad, and were going to have the ability to bring down the national debt."}]}

Police officers are the best of us. And the men and women, white, African-American, Asian, Latino, Hispanic, they put their lives on the line every single day. And let me say, at the risk of agreeing with you, community policing is a great idea. Its worked in the Hoosier state. And we fully support that. Donald Trump and I are going to make sure that law enforcement have the resources and the tools to be able to really restore law and order to the cities and communities in this nation. Its probably  probably why the 330,000 members of the Fraternal Order of Police endorsed Donald Trump as the next president of the United States of America, because they see his commitment to them. They see his commitment to law and order. But they also  they also hear the bad mouthing, the bad mouthing that comes from people that seize upon tragedy in the wake of police action shootings as  as a reason to  to use a broad brush to accuse law enforcement of  of implicit bias or institutional racism.

He fought hard through some of the most difficult days in Operation Iraqi Freedom, and he paid the ultimate sacrifice to defend our freedom and secure that nation.

And the small and bullying leader of Russia is now dictating terms to the United States to the point where all the United States of America  the greatest nation on Earth  just withdraws from talks about a cease-fire while Vladimir Putin puts a missile defense system in Syria while he marshals the forces and begins  look, we have got to begin to lean into this with strong, broad-shouldered American leadership. It begins by rebuilding our military. And the Russians and the Chinese have been making enormous investments in the military. We have the smallest Navy since 1916. We have the lowest number of troops since the end of the Second World War. Weve got to work with the Congress, and Donald Trump will, to rebuild our military and project American strength in the world.

And secondly, I just have to tell you that the provocations by Russia need to be met with American strength. And if Russia chooses to be involved and continue, I should say, to be involved in this barbaric attack on civilians in Aleppo, the United States of America should be prepared to use military force to strike military targets of the Assad regime to prevent them from this humanitarian crisis that is taking place in Aleppo.

Thank you, Senator. This is a very challenging time in the life of our nation. Weakened Americas place in the world after the leadership of Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama on the world stage has been followed by an economy that is truly struggling, stifled by an avalanche of more taxes, more regulation, Obamacare, the war on coal, and the kind of trade deals that have put American workers in the back seat. I think the best way that we can bring people together is through change in Washington, D.C. You know, I served in Washington, D.C., for 12 years in the Congress of the United States. And I served with many Republicans and Democrats, men and women of goodwill. The potential is there to really change the direction of this country, but its going to take leadership to do it. The American people want to see our nation standing tall on the world stage again. They want to see us supporting our military, rebuilding our military, commanding the respect of the world, and they want to see the American economy off to the races again. They want to see an American comeback. And Donald Trumps entire career has been about building. Its been about  its going through hardship just like a businessperson does and finding a way through smarts and ingenuity and resilience to fight forward and  when Donald Trump becomes president of the United States, were going to have a stronger America. When you hear him say he wants to make America great again, when we do that, I truly do believe the American people are going to be standing taller. Theyre going to see that real change can happen after decades of just talking about it. And when that happens, the American people are going to stand tall, stand together, and well have the kind of unity thats been missing for way too long."}]}

And I want to thank the Commission and the University of Utah for hosting this event. And Senator Harris, its a privilege to be on the stage with you. Our nation has gone through a very challenging time this year. But I want the American people to know that from the very first day, President Donald Trump has put the health of America first. Before there were more than five cases in the United States, all people who had returned from China, President Donald Trump did what no other American president had ever done. And that was he suspended all travel from China, the second largest economy in the world. Now, Senator, Joe Biden opposed that decision. He said it was xenophobic and hysterical, but I can tell you, having led the White House Coronavirus Task Force, that that decision alone by President Trump bought us invaluable time to stand up the greatest national mobilization since World War II. And I believe its saved hundreds of thousands of American lives. Because with that time we were able to reinvent testing. More than 115 million tests have been done to date. We were able to see to the delivery of billions of supplies so our doctors and nurses had the resources and support they needed. And we began, really before the month of February it was hard to develop a vaccine and to develop medicines and therapeutics thatve been saving lives all along the way. And under President Trumps leadership, Operation Warp Speed, we believe, will have literally tens of millions of doses of a vaccine before the end of this year. The reality is, when you look at the Biden plan, it reads an awful lot like what President Trump and I and our task force have been doing every step of the way. And quite frankly, when I look at their plan that talks about advancing testing, creating new PPE, developing a vaccine, umm, it looks a little bit like plagiarism, which is something Joe Biden knows a little bit about. I think the American people know that this is a president who has put the health of America first and the American people, I believe with my heart, can be proud of the sacrifices they have made. Its saved countless American lives."}]}

In the height of the epidemic, when we were losing a heartbreaking number of 2,500 Americans a day, we surged resources to New Jersey, and New York, and New Orleans and Detroit. We told the American people what needed to be done and the American people made the sacrifices. When the outbreak in the Sunbelt happened this summer, again, Americans stepped forward.

So, the fact that you continue to undermine public confidence in a vaccine if the vaccine emerges during the Trump administration, I think is unconscionable. And Senator, I just ask you, stop playing politics with peoples lives. The reality is that we will have a vaccine, we believe, before the end of this year, and it will have the capacity to save countless American lives. And your continuous undermining of confidence in a vaccine is just, its just unacceptable. And let me also say, you know the reality is when you talk about, about failure in this administration, we actually do know what failure looks like in a pandemic. It was 2009. The Swine Flu arrived in the United States. Thankfully, it was, ended up not being as lethal as the coronavirus. But before the end of the year, when Joe Biden was Vice President of the United States, not seven and a half million people contracted the swine flu, 60 million Americans contracted the swine flu. If the swine flu had been as lethal as the coronavirus in 2009 when Joe Biden was vice president, we would have lost 2 million American lives. His own Chief of Staff Ron Klain would say last year that it was pure luck. That they did everything possible wrong. And we learned from that. They left the Strategic National Stockpile empty.

Could you explain your voting record on these trade agreements and how it aligns with your vision for American industry and employment?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Thank you Susan. Well let me, before I leave that, let me, let me speak to voting records, if I can. You know, everybody knows that NAFTA caused literally thousands of American factories to close. We saw automotive jobs go south of the border. President Trump fought to renegotiate NAFTA, and the United States, Mexico, Canada agreement is now the law of the land. American people deserve to know Senator Kamala Harris was one of only 10 members of the Senate to vote against the USMCA. It was a huge win for American auto workers. It was a huge win for American farmers, especially dairy in the upper Midwest. But, Senator, you said it didnt go far enough on climate change, that you put your, your radical environmental agenda ahead of American auto workers and ahead of American jobs. I think the American people deserve to know that. Its probably why Newsweek magazine said that, that Kamala Harris was the most liberal member of the United States Senate in 2019, more liberal than Bernie Sanders, more, more liberal than any of the others in the United States Senate. So, now with regard to China, Susan, first and foremost  China is to blame for the coronavirus. And President Trump is not happy about it. Hes made that very clear. He made it clear again today. China and the World Health Organization did not play straight with the American people. They did not let our personnel into China to get information on the coronavirus until the middle of February. Fortunately, President Trump, in dealing with China from the outset of this administration  standing up to China, that had been taking advantage of America for decades  in the wake of Joe Bidens cheerleading for China, President Trump made that decision before the end of January to suspend all travel from China. And again, the American people deserve to know, Joe Biden opposed President Trumps decision to suspend all travel from China. He said it was hysterical, he said it was xenophobic"}]}

Weve stood strong with our allies, but weve been demanding. NATO is now contributing more to our common defense than ever before. Thanks to President Trumps leadership, weve strengthen our alliances across the Asia Pacific. And weve stood strong against those who would do us harm. You know when President Trump came into office, ISIS had captured an area of the Middle East, the size of Pennsylvania. President Trump unleashed the American military, and our armed forces destroyed the ISIS caliphate and took down their leader al Baghdadi without one American casualty. al Baghdadi was responsible for the death of thousands. But notably, Americas hearts today are with the family of Kayla Mueller, the parents of which are here with us tonight in Salt Lake City. Today, two of the ISIS killers responsible for Kayla Muellers murder, were brought to justice in the United States. Jihadi John was killed on the battlefield, along with the other few. The reality is that when Joe Biden was vice president, we had an opportunity to save Kayla Mueller. Breaks my heart to reflect on it, but the military came into the Oval Office, presented a plan. They said they knew where Kayla was. Baghdadi had held her for 18 months, abused her mercilessly before they killed her. But when Joe Biden was vice president, they hesitated for a month. And when Armed Forces finally went in, it was clear shed been moved two days earlier, and her family says  with a heart that broke the heart of every American  that if President Donald Trump had been president, they believe Kayla would be alive today."}]}

The American people deserve to know, Quasem Soleimani, the Iranian general, was responsible for the death of hundreds of American servicemembers. When the opportunity came, we saw him headed to Baghdad to kill more Americans, President Trump didnt hesitate and Quasem Soleimani is gone. But you deserve to know that Joe Biden and Kamala Harris actually criticized the decision to take out Quasem Soleimani. Its really inexplicable, but with regard to Joe Biden its explainable, because history records that Joe Biden actually opposed the raid against Osama bin Laden. Its absolutely essential that we have a commander in chief who will not hesitate to act to protect American lives and to protect American servicemembers, and thats what you have in President Donald Trump. Now with regard to the Supreme Court of the United States. Let me say, President Trump and I could not be more enthusiastic about the opportunity to see Judge Amy Coney Barrett become Justice Amy Coney Barrett. Shes a brilliant woman, and she will bring a lifetime of experience and a sizable American family, to the Supreme Court of the United States. And our hope is, in the hearing next week, unlike Justice Kavanaugh received with treatment from you and others. We hope she gets a fair hearing. And we particularly hope that we dont see the kind of attacks on her Christian faith that we saw before. Democratic Chairman of the Judiciary Committee before, when Judge Barrett was being confirmed for the Court of Appeals, expressed concern that the dogma of her faith lived loudly in her. Dick Durbin of Illinois said that it was a concern. Senator, I know one of our judicial nominees, you actually attacked because they were a member of the Catholic Knights of Columbus, just because the Knights of Columbus holds pro-life views."}]}

First of all, Joe Biden and I are both people of faith. And its insulting to suggest that we would knock anyone for their faith, and in fact, Joe if elected will be only the second practicing Catholic, as President of the United States. On the issue of this nomination  Joe and I are very clear, as are the majority of the American people. We are 27 days before the decision about who will be the next president of the United States. And you know before, when this conversation has come up, you know its been about election year or election time. Were literally in an election. Over 4 million people have voted. People are in the process of voting right now. And so Joe has been very clear, as the American people are: Let the American people fill that seat in the White House, and then well fill that seat on the United States Supreme Court. And to your point, Susan, the issues before us couldnt be more serious. Theres the issue of choice, and I will always fight for a womans right to make a decision about her own body. It should be her decision and not that of Donald Trump, and the Vice President, Michael Pence. But lets also look at what else is before the court. Its the Affordable Care Act. Like, literally in the midst of a public health pandemic  when over 210,000 people have died and 7 million people probably have what will be in the future considered a pre-existing condition because you contracted the virus  Donald Trump is in court right now trying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act. And Ive said it before and it bears repeating: This means that there will be no more protections, if they win, for people with pre-existing conditions. This means that over 20 million people will lose your coverage. It means that if youre under the age of 26, you cant stay on your parents coverage anymore. And heres the thing. The contrast couldnt be more clear. Theyre trying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act. Joe Biden is saying lets expand coverage, lets give you a choice of a public option or private coverage, lets bring down premiums, lets lower Medicare eligibility to 60. Thats true leadership."}]}

Let me just say, addressing your very first question, I couldnt be more proud to serve as vice president to a President who stands without apology for the sanctity of human life. Im pro-life. I dont apologize for it. And this is another one of those cases where theres such a dramatic contrast. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris support taxpayer funding of abortion, all the way up to the moment of birth, late-term abortion. They want to increase funding to Planned Parenthood of America. Now for our part, I would never presume how Judge Amy Coney Barrett would rule on the Supreme Court of the United States but well continue to stand strong for the right to life. When you speak about the Supreme Court, though, I think the American people really deserve an answer, Senator Harris. Are you and Joe Biden gonna pack the court if Judge Amy Coney Barrett is confirmed? I mean, there have been 29 vacancies on the Supreme Court during presidential election years, from George Washington to Barack Obama. Presidents have nominated in all 29 cases. But your party is actually openly advocating adding seats to the Supreme Court, which has had nine seats for 150 years, if you dont get your way. This is a classic case of if you cant win by the rules, youre going to change the rules. Now youve refused to answer the question, Joe Biden has refused to answer the question. I think the American people would really like to know. If Judge Amy Coney Barrett is confirmed to the Supreme Court of the United States, are you and Joe Biden, if somehow you win this election, going to pack the Supreme Court to get your way?"}]}

And with regard to George Floyd, theres no excuse for what happened to George Floyd. Justice will be served. But theres also no excuse for the rioting and looting that followed. I mean, it really is astonishing. Flora Westbrook is with us here tonight in Salt Lake City. Just a few weeks ago, I stood at what used to be her salon, was burned to the ground. By rioters and looters. And Flora is still trying to put her life back together. And I must tell ya, this, this presumption that you hear consistently from Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, that America is systemically racist. That as Joe Biden said, that he believes that law enforcement has an implicit bias against minorities, is a great insult to the men and women who serve in law enforcement. And I want everyone to know, who puts on the uniform of law enforcement every day, that President Trump and I stand with you. It is remarkable that when Senator Tim Scott tried to pass a police reform bill, brought together a group of Republicans and Democrats  Senator Harris, you got up and walked out of the room.

Because while Joe Biden and Kamala Harris rattle off a long litany, the establishment in Washington DC and the establishment Joe Bidens been a part of for 47 years. President Donald Trump has launched a movement of everyday Americans from every walk of life. And I have every confidence that the same Americans that delivered that historic victory in 2016, they see this Presidents record, where we rebuild our military, we revived our economy through tax cuts and rolling back regulation, fighting for fair trade, unleashing American energy. We appointed conservatives to our federal courts at every level. And we stood with the men and women of law enforcement every single day, and I think, I think that movement of Americans has only grown stronger in the last four years. When you talk about accepting the outcome of the election, I must tell you, Senator, your party has spent the last three and a half years trying to overturn the results of the last election. Its amazing. When Joe Biden was vice president of the United States, the FBI actually spied on President Trump and my campaign. I mean there were documents released this week that the CIA actually made a referral to the FBI documenting that those allegations were coming from the Hillary Clinton campaign, and of course, weve all seen the avalanche with the  what, what you put the country through, for the better part of three years, until it was found that there was no obstruction, no collusion, case closed. And then Senator Harris, you and your colleagues in the Congress tried to impeach the President of the United States, over a phone call. And now Hillary Clinton has actually said to Joe Biden that under, in her words, under no circumstances should he concede the election. So let me just say, I think were gonna win this election. President Trump and I are fighting every day in courthouses to prevent Joe Biden and Kamala Harris from changing the rules and creating this universal mail-in voting, thatll create a massive opportunity for voter fraud. We have a free and fair election; we know were going to have confidence in it. And I believe in all my heart that President Donald Trumps gonna be reelected for four more years."}]}

I would tell you that  dont assume that what youre seeing on your local news networks is synonymous with the American people.

They were on polar opposites, on the Supreme Court of the United States  one very liberal, one very conservative.

We need a Supreme Court that in my opinion is going to uphold the Second Amendment, and all amendments, but the Second Amendment, which is under absolute siege. I believe if my opponent should win this race, which I truly dont think will happen, we will have a Second Amendment which will be a very, very small replica of what it is right now.

Its poisoning the blood of their youth and plenty of other people. We have to have strong borders. We have to keep the drugs out of our country. We areright now, were getting the drugs, theyre getting the cash. We need strong borders. We need absolutewe cannot give amnesty. Now, I want to build the wall. We need the wall. And the Border Patrol, ICE, they all want the wall. We stop the drugs. We shore up the border. One of my first acts will be to get all of the drug lords, all of the bad oneswe have some bad, bad people in this country that have to go out. Were going to get them out; were going to secure the border. And once the border is secured, at a later date, well make a determination as to the rest. But we have some bad hombres here, and were going to get them out."}]}

That was one of the worst things thats ever been signed by our country. Now she wants to sign Trans-Pacific Partnership. And she wants it.

Douglas MacArthur, George Patton spinning in their graves when they see the stupidity of our country. So were now fighting for Mosul, that we had. All she had to do was stay there, and now were going in to get it. But you know who the big winner in Mosul is going to be after we eventually get it? And the only reason they did it is because shes running for the office of president and they want to look tough. They want to look good. He violated the red line in the sand, and he made so many mistakes, made all mistakes. Thats why we have the great migration. But she wanted to look good for the election. So theyre going in. But whos going to get Mosul, really? Well take Mosul eventually. But the wayif you look at whats happening, much tougher than they thought. Much, much tougher. Much more dangerous. Going to be more deaths that they thought. But the leaders that we wanted to get are all gone because theyre smart. They say, what do we need this for? So Mosul is going to be a wonderful thing. And Iran should write us a letter of thank you, just like the really stupidthe stupidest deal of all time, a deal thats going to give Iran absolutely nuclear weapons. Iran should write us yet another letter saying thank you very much, because Iran, as I said many years ago, Iran is taking over Iraq, something theyve wanted to do forever, but weve made it so easy for them. So were now going to take Mosul. And you know whos going to be the beneficiary? Iran. Oh, yeah, theyre makingI mean, they are outsmartinglook, youre not there, you might be involved in that decision. But you were there when you took everybody out of Mosul and out of Iraq. You shouldnt have been in Iraq, but you did vote for it. You shouldnt have been in Iraq, but once you were in Iraq, you should have never left the way."}]}

But then I made a decision, Run it as well as you can  to my people, great people  Run it as well as you can. I could have gone the other route and made everybody very unhappy. They ran it. Premiums are down, everythings down. Heres the problem. No matter how well you run it, its no good. What wed like to do is terminate it. We have the individual mandate done. I dont know that its going to work. If we dont win, we will have to run it and well have Obamacare, but it will be better run. But it no longer is Obamacare. Because without the individual mandate, its much different. Pre-existing conditions will always stay. What I would like to do is a much better health care, much better. Well always protect people with pre-existing  so Id like to terminate Obamacare, come up with a brand new beautiful health care. The Democrats will do it because therell be tremendous pressure on them. And we might even have the House by that time. And I think were going to win the House, okay? Youll see, but I think were gonna win the House. But come up with a better health care, always protecting people with pre-existing conditions  and one thing very important. We have 180 million people out there that have great private health care, far more than were talking about with Obamacare. Joe Biden is going to terminate all of those policies. These are people that love their health care, people that have been successful  middle income people  been successful. They have 180 million plans, 180 million people, families under what he wants to do, which will basically be socialized medicine. He wont even have a choice. They want to terminate 180 million plans.

When I look at all of the things that I see and all of the potential that our country has, we have such tremendous potential, whether its in business and trade, where were doing so badly.

So you really owe him an apology. Youre the one that sent the pictures around your campaign, sent the pictures around with President Obama in a certain garb. That was long before I was ever involved, so you actually owe an apology. Number two, Michelle Obama. Ive gotten to see the commercials that they did on you. And Ive gotten to see some of the most vicious commercials Ive ever seen of Michelle Obama talking about you, Hillary. So, you talk about friend? Go back and take a look at those commercials, a race where you lost fair and square, unlike the Bernie Sanders race, where you won, but not fair and square, in my opinion.

And I was so surprised to see him sign on with the devil. But when you talk about apology, I think the one that you should really be apologizing for and the thing that you should be apologizing for are the 33,000 e-mails that you deleted, and that you acid washed, and then the two boxes of e-mails and other things last week that were taken from an office and are now missing. And Ill tell you what. I didnt think Id say this, but Im going to say it, and I hate to say it.

In 17, it implodes by itself. Their method of fixing it is to go back and ask Congress for more money, more and more money. We have right now almost $20 trillion in debt. Obamacare will never work. Its very bad, very bad health insurance. Far too expensive. And not only expensive for the person that has it, unbelievably expensive for our country. Its going to be one of the biggest line items very shortly. We have to repeal it and replace it with something absolutely much less expensive and something that works, where your plan can actually be tailored. We have to get rid of the lines around the state, artificial lines, where we stop insurance companies from coming in and competing, because they wantand President Obama and whoever was working on itthey want to leave those lines, because that gives the insurance companies essentially monopolies. We want competition. You will have the finest health care plan there is. She wants to go to a single-payer plan, which would be a disaster, somewhat similar to Canada. And if you havent noticed the Canadians, when they need a big operation, when something happens, they come into the United States in many cases because their system is so slow. Its catastrophic in certain ways. But she wants to go to single payer, which means the government basically rules everything. Hillary Clinton has been after this for years. Obamacare was the first step. Obamacare is a total disaster.

I have a very, very great balance sheet, so great that when I did the Old Post Office on Pennsylvania Avenue, the United States government, because of my balance sheet, which they actually know very well, chose me to do the Old Post Office, between the White House and Congress, chose me to do the Old Post Office. One of the primary things, in fact, perhaps the primary thing was balance sheet. But I have no loans with Russia. You could go to the United States government, and they would probably tell you that, because they know my sheet very well in order to get that development I had to have.

Shes a United Statesshe was a United States senator. She complains that Donald Trump took advantage of the tax code. Well, why didnt she change it? Why didnt you change it when you were a senator? The reason you didnt is that all your friends take the same advantage that I do. And I do. You have provisions in the tax code that, frankly, we could change. But you wouldnt change it, because all of these people give you the money so you can take negative ads on Donald Trump. Butand I say that about a lot of things. You know, Ive heard Hillary complaining about so many different things over the years. I wish you would have done this. But shes been there for 30 years shes been doing this stuff. She never changed. And she never will change. She never will change. Were getting rid of carried interest provisions. Im lowering taxes actually, because I think its so important for corporations, because we have corporations leavingmassive corporations and little ones, little ones cant form. Were getting rid of regulations which goes hand in hand with the lowering of the taxes. But were bringing the tax rate down from 35 percent to 15 percent. Were cutting taxes for the middle class. And I will tell you, we are cutting them big league for the middle class. And I will tell you, Hillary Clinton is raising your taxes, folks. You can look at me. Shes raising your taxes really high. And what thats going to do is a disaster for the country. But she is raising your taxes and Im lowering your taxes. That in itself is a big difference. We are going to be thriving again. We have no growth in this country. Theres no growth. If China has a GDP of 7 percent, its like a national catastrophe. Were down at 1 percent. And thats, like, no growth. And were going lower, in my opinion. And a lot of it has to do with the fact that our taxes are so high, just about the highest in the world. And Im bringing them down to one of the lower in the world. And I think its so importantone of the most important things we can do. But she is raising everybodys taxes massively."}]}

Coal will last for 1,000 years in this country. Now we have natural gas and so many other things because of technology. We have unbelievablewe have found over the last seven years, we have found tremendous wealth right under our feet. So good. Especially when you have $20 trillion in debt. I will bring our energy companies back. Theyll be able to compete. Theyll make money. Theyll pay off our national debt. Theyll pay off our tremendous budget deficits, which are tremendous. But we are putting our energy companies out of business. We have to bring back our workers. You take a look at whats happening to steel and the cost of steel and China dumping vast amounts of steel all over the United States, which essentially is killing our steelworkers and our steel companies. We have to guard our energy companies. We have to make it possible. The EPA is so restrictive that they are putting our energy companies out of business. And all you have to do is go to a great place like West Virginia or places like Ohio, which is phenomenal, or places like Pennsylvania and you see what theyre doing to the people, miners and others in the energy business.

The greatest, before COVID came in, the greatest economy in history, lowest employunemployment numbers, everything was good. Everything was going. And by the way, there was unity going to happen. People were calling me for the first time in years, they were calling, and they were saying its time maybe and then what happened? We got hit. But now were building it back up again. A rebuilding of the military, including Space Force and all of the other things. A fixing of the VA which was a mess under him. Three hundred and eight thousand people died because they didnt have proper health care. It was a mess. And we now got a 91% approval rating at the VA, our vets. We take care of our vets. But weve rebuilt our military. The job that weve done. . . and, and Ill tell you something, some people say maybe the most important. By the end of the first term, Ill have approximately 300 Federal judges and Court of Appeals judges, 300, and hopefully three great Supreme Court judges, justices. That is a record the likes of which very few people. . . and you know, one of the reasons Ill have so many judges? Because President Obama and him left me 128 judges to fill. When you leave office, you dont leave any judges. Thats like, you just dont do that. They left 128 openings, and if I were a member of his party, because they have a little different philosophy, Id say, if you left us 128 openings you cant be a good president. You cant be a good Vice President but I want to thank you because it gives us almost, itll probably be above that number. By the end of this term, 300 judges. Its a record."}]}

They came after me spying on my campaign. They started from the day I won, and even before I won. From the day I came down the escalator with our first lady, they were a disaster. They were a disgrace to our country, and weve caught em. Weve caught em all. Weve got it all on tape. Weve caught em all. And by the way, you gave the idea for the Logan Act against General Flynn. You better take a look at that, because we caught you in a sense, and President Obama was sitting in the office. He knew about it too. So dont tell me about a free transition. As far as the ballots are concerned, its a disaster. A solicited ballot, okay, solicited, is okay. Youre soliciting. Youre asking. They send it back. You send it back. I did that.

They found some, with the name Trump, just happened to have the name Trump, just the other day in a wastepaper basket. Theyre being sent all over the place. They sent two in a Democrat area. They sent out a thousand ballots. Everybody got two ballots. This is going to be a fraud like youve never seen. The other thing, its nice. On November 3rd, youre watching, and you see who won the election. And I think were going to do well because people are really happy with the job weve done. But you know what? We wont know.

Our jobs are fleeing the country. Theyre going to Mexico. Theyre going to many other countries. You look at what China is doing to our country in terms of making our product. Theyre devaluing their currency, and theres nobody in our government to fight them. And we have a very good fight. And we have a winning fight. Because theyre using our country as a piggy bank to rebuild China, and many other countries are doing the same thing. So were losing our good jobs, so many of them. When you look at whats happening in Mexico, a friend of mine who builds plants said its the eighth wonder of the world. Theyre building some of the biggest plants anywhere in the world, some of the most sophisticated, some of the best plants. With the United States, as he said, not so much. So Ford is leaving. You see that, their small car division leaving. Thousands of jobs leaving Michigan, leaving Ohio. Theyre all leaving. And we cant allow it to happen anymore. As far as child care is concerned and so many other things, I think Hillary and I agree on that. We probably disagree a little bit as to numbers and amounts and what were going to do, but perhaps well be talking about that later. But we have to stop our jobs from being stolen from us. We have to stop our companies from leaving the United States and, with it, firing all of their people. All you have to do is take a look at Carrier air conditioning in Indianapolis. They leftfired 1,400 people. Theyre going to Mexico. So many hundreds and hundreds of companies are doing this. We cannot let it happen. Under my plan, Ill be reducing taxes tremendously, from 35 percent to 15 percent for companies, small and big businesses. Thats going to be a job creator like we havent seen since Ronald Reagan. Its going to be a beautiful thing to watch. Companies will come. They will build. They will expand. New companies will start. And I look very, very much forward to doing it.

When we sell into Mexico, theres a tax. When they sell inautomatic, 16 percent, approximately. When they sell into us, theres no tax. Its a defective agreement.

The report that said $650which, by the way, a lot of friends of mine that know my business say, boy, thats really not a lot of money. Its not a lot of money relative to what I had. The buildings that were in question, they said in the same report, which wasactually, it wasnt even a bad story, to be honest with you, but the buildings are worth $3.9 billion.

These are very fine institutions, very fine banks. I could do that very quickly. I am very underleveraged. I have a great company. I have a tremendous income.

You land at LaGuardia, you land at Kennedy, you land at LAX, you land at Newark, and you come in from Dubai and Qatar and you see these incredibleyou come in from China, you see these incredible airports, and you landweve become a third world country. So the worst of all things has happened. We owe $20 trillion, and were a mess. We havent even started. And weve spent $6 trillion in the Middle East, according to a report that I just saw. Whether its 6 or 5, but it looks like its 6, $6 trillion in the Middle East, we could have rebuilt our country twice. And its really a shame. And its politicians like Secretary Clinton that have caused this problem. Our country has tremendous problems. Were a debtor nation. Were a serious debtor nation.

But on occasion, four times, we used certain laws that are there.

Now, if you want to change the laws, youve been there a long time, change the laws. But I take advantage of the laws of the nation because Im running a company.

Now, whether that was Russia, whether that was China, whether it was another country, we dont know, because the truth is, under President Obama weve lost control of things that we used to have control over. We came in with the Internet, we came up with the Internet, and I think Secretary Clinton and myself would agree very much, when you look at what ISIS is doing with the Internet, theyre beating us at our own game. ISIS. So we have to get very, very tough on cyber and cyber warfare. It isit is a huge problem. I have a son. Hes 10 years old. He has computers. He is so good with these computers, its unbelievable. The security aspect of cyber is very, very tough. And maybe its hardly doable. But I will say, we are not doing the job we should be doing. But thats true throughout our whole governmental society. We have so many things that we have to do better, Lester, and certainly cyber is one of them."}]}

Well, President Obama and Secretary Clinton created a vacuum the way they got out of Iraq, because they got outwhat, they shouldnt have been in, but once they got in, the way they got out was a disaster. And ISIS was formed. So she talks about taking them out. Shes been doing it a long time. Shes been trying to take them out for a long time. But they wouldnt have even been formed if they left some troops behind, like 10,000 or maybe something more than that. And then you wouldnt have had them. Or, as Ive been saying for a long time, and I think youll agree, because I said it to you once, had we taken the oiland we should have taken the oilISIS would not have been able to form either, because the oil was their primary source of income.

Number one, the 28 countries of NATO, many of them arent paying their fair share. Number twoand that bothers me, because we should be askingwere defending them, and they should at least be paying us what theyre supposed to be paying by treaty and contract. And, number two, I said, and very strongly, NATO could be obsolete, becauseand I was very strong on this, and it was actually covered very accurately in the New York Times, which is unusual for the New York Times, to be honestbut I said, they do not focus on terror.

I cant take anything off the table. Because you look at some of these countries, you look at North Korea, were doing nothing there. China should solve that problem for us. China should go into North Korea. China is totally powerful as it relates to North Korea. And by the way, another one powerful is the worst deal I think Ive ever seen negotiated that you started is the Iran deal. Iran is one of their biggest trading partners. Iran has power over North Korea. And when they made that horrible deal with Iran, they should have included the fact that they do something with respect to North Korea. And they should have done something with respect to Yemen and all these other places. And when asked to Secretary Kerry, why didnt you do that? Why didnt you add other things into the deal? One of the great giveaways of all time, of all time, including $400 million in cash. Nobodys ever seen that before. That turned out to be wrong. It was actually $1.7 billion in cash, obviously, I guess for the hostages. It certainly looks that way. So you say to yourself, why didnt they make the right deal?

She's not gonna get the vote. She can't get the vote. She won't even come close to it. So it's just talk. You know what it reminds me of?

The student loans--and then her--I think probably her boss, if you call 'em a boss, he spends all his time on the beach--but look, her boss went out and said we'll do it again, we'll do it a different way. He went out, got rejected again by the Supreme Court. So all these students got uh, taunted with this whole thing about--this whole idea.

Look, we're in for 250 billion or more, because they don't ask Europe, which is a much bigger beneficiary to getting this thing done than we are. They're in for $150 billion less because Biden and you don't have the courage to ask Europe like I did with NATO. They paid billions and billions, hundreds of billions of dollars when I said either you pay up or we're not gonna protect you anymore. So that may be one of the reasons they don't like me as much as they like weak people. But you take a look at what's happening. We're in for 250 to 275 billion. They're into 100 to 150. They should be forced to equalize. With that being said, I wanna get the war settled. I know Zelenskyy very well, and I know Putin very well. I have a good relationship. And they respect your President. Okay? They respect me. They don't respect Biden. How would you respect him? Why? For what reason? He hasn't even made a phone call in two years to Putin. Hasn't spoken to anybody. They don't even try and get it. That is a war that's dying to be settled. I will get it settled before I even become President. If I win, when I'm President-Elect, and what I'll do is I'll speak to one, I'll speak to the other, I'll get 'em together. That war would have never happened. And in fact when I saw Putin after I left, unfortunately left because our--our country has gone to hell, but after I left when I saw him building up soldiers, he did it after I left, I said oh, he must be negotiating. It must be a good strong point of negotiation. Well, it wasn't because Biden had no idea how to talk to him. He had no idea how to stop it. And now you have millions of people dead and it's only getting worse and it could lead to World War 3. Don't kid yourself, David. We're playing with World War 3. And we have a President that we don't even know if he's -- where is our President? We don't even know if he's a President."}]}

If they woulda done that, we woulda had a much better plan than Obamacare. But the Democrats came up, they wouldn't vote for it. I had a choice to make when I was President, do I save it and make it as good as it can be? Never gonna be great. Or do I let it rot? And I felt I had an obligation, even though politically it would have been good to just let it rot and let it go away. I decided--and I told my people, the top people, and they're very good people--I have a lot of good people in this -- that administration. We read about the bad ones. We had some real bad ones too.

I had a choice to make do I save it and make it as good as it can be, or do I let it rot? And I saved it. I did the right thing. But it's still never going to be great.
