I think its accurate to say that Mr. Ford voted against the uh  Voting Rights Acts and the uh  Civil Rights Acts in their uh  debative stage I think once it was assured they were going to pass he finally voted for it. This country uh  changed drastically in 1969 when the uh  terms of John Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson were over and Richard Nixon and  and Gerald Ford became the presidents. There was a time when there was hope for those who uh  were poor and downtrodden and who were  uh elderly or who were  uh ill or who were in minority groups, but that time has been gone. I think the greatest thing that ever happened to the South was the passage of the Civil Rights Act and the opening up of opportunities  uh to black people  the chance to vote, to hold a job, to buy a house, to go to school, and to participate in public affairs. It not only liberated  uh black people but it also liberated the whites. Weve seen uh  in many instances in recent years a minority affairs uh  section of uh Small Loan Administration, uh  Small Business Administration lend uh  a black entrepreneur just enough money to get started, and then to go bankrupt. The bankruptcies have gone up  uh in an extraordinary degree. Uh  FHA, which used to be a very responsible agency, uh  that everyone looked to to help own a home, lost six million dollars last year. Thereve been over thirteen hundred indictments in HUD, over eight hundred convictions relating just to home loans. And now the federal government has become the worlds greatest slum landlord. Weve got a 30 percent or 40 percent unemployment rate among minority uh  young people. And theres been no concerted effort given to the needs of those who are both poor and black, or poor and who speak a foreign language. And thats where theres been a great uh generation of despair, and ill health, and the lack of education, lack of purposefulness, and the lack of hope for the future. But it doesnt take just a quiet uh  dormant uh minimum enforcement of the law. It requires an aggressive searching out and reaching out to help people who especially need it. And thats been lacking in the last eight years."}]}

Also, recently, when someone suggested that the Occupational Safety and Health Act should be abolished, Governor Reagan responded, amen. The offshore drilling rights is a question that Governor Reagan raises often. As a matter of fact, in the proposal for the Alaska lands legislation, 100% of all the offshore lands would be open for exploration, and 95% of all the Alaska lands, where it is suspected or believed that minerals might exist. We have, with our five-year plan for the leasing of offshore lands, proposed more land to be drilled than has been opened up for drilling since this program first started in 1954. So were not putting restraints on American exploration, were encouraging it in every way we can."}]}

When I was that far ahead, it was immediately following the Democratic Convention, and before the Republican Convention. At that time, uh  25 or 30 percent of the Reagan supporters said that they would not support President Ford. But as occurred at the end of the con- Democratic Convention, the Republican Party unified itself. And I think immediately following the Republican Convention, there was about a ten-point spread. I believe that to be accurate, I had 49 percent; President Ford, 39 percent. Uh  the polls uh  are good indications of fluctuations, but they vary widely one from another. And the only poll Ive ever followed is the one that uh  you know, is taken on election day. I was in uh  thirty primaries in the spring, and uh  at first it was obvious that I didnt have any standing in the poll. As a matter of fact, I think when Gallup ran their first poll in December of 1975 they didnt put my name on the list. They had thirty-five people on the list. My name wasnt even there. And at the beginning of the year I had about 2 percent. So the polls to me are interesting, but they dont determine, you know, my hopes or  or my despair. I campaign among people. Ive never depended on powerful political figures to put me in office. I have a direct relationship with hundreds of people around  hundreds of thousands around the country who actively campaign for me. In Georgia alone, for instance, I got 84 percent of the vote, and I think there were fourteen people uh  in addition to myself on the ballot, and Governor Wallace had been very strong in Georgia. Thats an overwhelming support from my own people who know me best. And today, we have about five hundred Georgians at their own expense  just working people who believe in me  spread around the country uh  involved in the political campaign. So, the polls are interesting, but uh  I dont know how to explain the fluctuation. I think a lot of it uh  depends on current events  uh  sometimes foreign affairs, sometimes domestic affairs. But I think our hold uh  of support among those who uh  are crucial to the election has been fairly steady. And my success in the primary season was, I think, notable for a newcomer, from someone whos from outside Washington, who  who never has been a part of the Washington establishment. And I think that well have good results uh  on November the second for myself and I hope for the country."}]}

Number two, we have to work with cities and others to help generate economic growth in those communities  through the Urban Development Action Grant Program. I dont mind those enterprise zones; lets try them, but not as a substitute for the others. Certainly education and training is crucial. If these young Americans dont have the skills that make them attractive to employees, theyre not going to get jobs. The next thing is to try to get more entrepreneurship in business within the reach of minorities so that these businesses are located in the communities in which theyre found. The other thing is, we need the business community as well as government heavily involved in these communities to try to get economic growth. There is no question that the poor are worse off. I think the President genuinely believes that theyre better off. But the figures show that about 8 million more people are below the poverty line than 4 years ago. How you can cut school lunches, how you can cut student assistance, how you can cut housing, how you can cut disability benefits, how you can do all of these things and then the people receiving them  for example, the disabled, who have no alternative  how theyre going to do better, I dont know. Now, we need a tight budget, but theres no question that this administration has singled out things that affect the most vulnerable in American life, and theyre hurting. One final point if I might. Theres another part of the lopsided economy that were in today, and that is that these heavy deficits have killed exports and are swamping the Nation with cheap imports. We are now $120 billion of imports, 3 million jobs lost, and farmers are having their worst year. Thats another reason to get the deficit down."}]}

I want to thank President Reagan for agreeing to debate. He didnt have to, and he did, and we all appreciate it. The Presidents favorite question is: Are you better off? Well, if youre wealthy, youre better off. If youre middle income, youre about where you were. And if youre modest income, youre worse off. Thats what the economists tell us. But is that really the question that should be asked? Isnt the real question is will we be better off? Will our children be better off? Are we building the future that this nation needs? I believe that if we ask those questions that bear on our future, not just congratulate ourselves but challenge us to solve those problems, youll see that we need new leadership. I would rather lose a campaign about decency than win a campaign about self-interest. I dont think this nation is composed of people who care only for themselves. And when we sought to assault Social Security and Medicare, as the record shows we did, I think that was mean-spirited. When we terminated 400,000 desperate, hopeless, defenseless Americans who were on disability  confused and unable to defend themselves, and just laid them out on the street, as we did for 4 years, I dont think thats what America is all about. America is a fair society, and it is not right that Vice President Bush pays less in taxes than the janitor who helps him. I believe theres fundamental fairness crying out that needs to be achieved in our tax system. I believe that we will be better off if we protect this environment. And contrary to what the President says, I think their record on the environment is inexcusable and often shameful. These laws are not being enforced, have not been enforced, and the public health and the air and the water are paying the price. Thats not fair for our future. I think our future requires a President to lead us in an all-out search to advance our education, our learning, and our science and training, because this world is more complex and were being pressed harder all the time. I believe in opening doors. We won the Olympics, in part, because weve had civil rights laws and the laws that prohibit discrimination against women. I have been for those efforts all my life. The Presidents record is quite different. The question is our future. President Kennedy once said in response to similar arguments, We are great, but we can be greater. We can be better if we face our future, rejoice in our strengths, face our problems, and by solving them, build a better society for our children. Thank you."}]}

In 1979 we ran a $29 billion deficit all year. This administration seems to run that every morning. And the result is exactly what we see. This economy is starting to run downhill. Housing is off. Last report on new purchases, its the lowest since 1982. Growth is a little over 3 percent now. Many people are predicting a recession.

Within that sixty-billion dollars increase there would be fit the programs that I promised the American people. I might say too, that  that if we see that these goals cannot be reached  and I believe theyre reasonable goals  then I would cut back on the rate of implement- implementation of new programs in order to accommodate a balanced budget by fiscal year 81 which is the last year of the next term.

And since today is Eleanor Roosevelts 100th birthday, let me quote her. She said, It is not enough to want peace, you must believe in it. And it is not enough to believe in it, you must work for it. This administrations policies have indicated quite the opposite. The last time I heard Vice President Bush blame the fact that they didnt meet with the Soviet leader, and this is the first president in forty years not to meet with a Soviet counterpart. He said the reason was because there are three Soviet leaders in the past three and a half years. I went and got a computer printout. Its five pages of the leaders, world leaders, that the Soviet leaders have met with, and theyre not little people. Theyre people like Mitterrand of France and Kohl of Germany and President Kiprianou of Cyprus  you go down the list, five pages of people that the Soviet leaders have managed to meet with and somehow they couldnt meet with the president of the United States. In addition to not meeting with his Soviet counterpart, this is the first president  and youre right  since the start of negotiating arms control agreements who have not negotiated an arms control agreement, But not only has he not negotiated one, hes been opposed to every single one that every other president has negotiated, including Eisenhower, including Ford, and including Nixon. Now, let me just say that with reference to the vice-presidents comments about the intent and the desire of the United Sites and this administration, the Soviet Union did walk out of the talks. I agree. But it seems to me in 1982, when the administration presented its Start proposal, that it wasnt a realistic proposal. And that is the comment that was made by Secretary Haig after he left office, because what it dealt with was that it dealt just with land-based nuclear missiles, which is where the Soviets had the bulk of their missiles. But that aside, in 1982, I believe it was, their own negotiator, Nitze, came out with a proposal called the walk-in-the-woods proposal which would have limited the number of nuclear arms in Europe. That proposal was turned down by the administration  a proposal presented by its own administrator. Now Im delighted that they met with Mr. Gromyko, but they could have had that opportunity to meet with him in 1981 when he came to the UN, which he had done with every other president before, and in 1982 as well.

In many instances weve made agreements, like in Vietnam, uh  that have uh  been revealed later on to our uh  embarrassment.

The American people dont know what those commitments are. Weve seen uh  in the past the destruction of elected governments, like in Chile, and the strong support of military dictatorship there. These kinds of things have hurt us very much. I would restore the concept of the fireside chat, which was an integral part of the administration of Franklin Roosevelt. And I would also restore the involvement of the Congress. When Harry Truman was president he was not afraid to have a strong secretary of defense. Dean Acheson, George Marshall were strong secretaries of uh  state  excuse me  state. But he also made sure that there was a bipartisan support. The members of Congress, Arthur Vandenberg, Walter George, were part of the process, and before our nation made a secret agreement, or before we made a bluffing statement, we were sure that we had the backing not only of the president and the secretary of state, but also of the Congress and the people. This is a responsibility of the president. And I think its very damaging to our country for Mr. Ford to have turned over this responsibility to the secretary of state."}]}

This is what the families of MIAs want. So far, Mr. Ford has not done it. Weve had several fragmentary efforts by members of the Congress and by  by private citizens. Several months ago the Vietnam government said, We are ready to sit down and negotiate for release of information on MIAs. So far, Mr. Ford has not responded.

Its about as valid as saying that you would have to be black in order to despise racism, that youd have to be female in order to be terribly offended by sexism. And thats just not so. I think if you take a look at where Ive been, both in the Congress and where I intend to go, the type of person I am  I think that the people of this country can rely upon the fact that I will be a lender. I dont think the Soviet Union for one minute can sit down and make determination on what I will do if Im ever in a position to have to do something with reference to the Soviet Union. Quite frankly Im prepared to do whatever is necessary in order to secure this country and make sure that security is maintained. Secondly, if the Soviet Union were to ever believe that they could challenge the United States with any sort of nuclear forces or otherwise, if I were in a position of leadership in this country, they would be assured that they would be met with swift, concise and certain retaliation. Let me just say one other thing now. The most important thing, though I think as a leader that what one has to do is get to the point where youre not put into that position. And the way you to that position of rnoving away from having to make a decision  armed force or anything else  is by moving toward arms control.

In addition to that, the build-up of military forces is good for our country because weve got to have military strength to preserve the peace. But Ill always remember that the best weapons are the ones that are never fired in combat, and the best soldier is one who never has to lay his life down on the field of battle.

That is the part that requires employers to determine the citizenship of an employee before theyre hired. Im convinced that the result of this would be that people who are Hispanic, people who have different languages or speak with an accent, would find it difficult to be employed. I think thats wrong. Weve never had citizenship tests in our country before, and I dont think we should have a citizenship card today. That is counterproductive. I do support the other aspects of the Simpson-Mazzoli bill that strengthen enforcement at the border, strengthen other ways of dealing with undocumented workers in this difficult area and dealing with the problem of settling people who have lived here for many, many years and do not have an established status. I have further strongly recommended that this administration do something it has not done, and that is to strengthen enforcement at the border, strengthen the officials in this government that deal with undocumented workers, and to do so in a way thats responsible and within the Constitution of the United States. We need an answer to this problem, but it must be an American answer that is consistent with justice and due process. Everyone in this room, practically, here tonight, is an immigrant. We came here loving this nation, serving it, and it has served all of our most bountiful dreams. And one of those dreams is justice.

Another thing that concerned me was what Mr. Ford said about unemployment, that  insinuating that under Johnson and Kennedy that unemployment could only be held down when this country is at war. Karl Marx said that the free enterprise system in a democracy can only continue to exist when they are at war or preparing far war. Karl Marx was the grandfather of Communism. I dont agree with that statement. I hope Mr. Ford doesnt either. He has put pressure on the Congress  and I dont believe Mr. Ford would even deny this  to hold up on nonproliferation legislation until the Congress agreed for an $8 billion program for private industry to start producing enriched uranium. And the last thing I wanna make is this. He talks about peace and Im thankful for peace. We were peaceful when Mr. Ford went into office. But he and Mr. Kissinger and others tried to start a new Vietnam in Angola, and it was only the outcry of the American people and the Congress when their secret deal was discovered that prevented our involvement in that conflagration which was taking place there."}]}

Over 50 percent  53 to be exact  percent of the tax benefits go to the 14 percent richest people in this country, and weve had a 50 percent increase in payroll deductions since Mr. Nixon went in office eight years ago. Mr. Ford has  has advocated since hes been in office over $5 billion in reductions for corporations, special interest groups, and the very, very wealthy who derive their income  not from labor  but from investments. Thats got to be changed. A few things that can be done: we have now a deferral system so that the multinational corporations who invest overseas  if they make a million dollars in profits overseas  they dont have to pay any of their taxes unless they bring their money back into this country. When they dont pay their taxes, the average American pays the taxes for them. Not only that, but it robs this country of jobs, because instead of coming back with that million dollars and creating a shoe factory, say in New Hampshire or Vermont, if the company takes the money down to Italy and  and builds a shoe factory, they dont have to pay any taxes on the money. Another thing is a system called DISC which was originally designed, proposed by Mr. Nixon, to encourage exports. This permits a company to create uh  a dummy corporation, to export their products, and then not to pay the full amount of taxes on them. This costs our uh  government about uh  $1.4 billion a year. And when those rich corporations dont pay that tax, the average American taxpayer pays it for em. Another one thats uh  thats very important is the uh  is the business deductions, uh  jet airplanes, uh  first class travel, the fifty-dollar martini lunch. The average working person cant  uh  cant take advantage of that, but the  the wealthier people  uh can. Uh  another system is where uhh  a dentist can invest money in say, raising cattle and uh  can put in a hundred thousand dollars of his own money, borrow nine hundred thousand dollars  nine hundred mi- thousand dollars  that makes a million  and mark off a great amount of uh  of loss uh  through that procedure. Uh  there was one example, for instance, where uh  somebody uh  produced pornographic movies. They put in $30 thousand of their own money and got a hundred and twenty thousand dollars in tax savings. Well, these special kinds of programs have  have robbed the average taxpayer and have benefited those who are powerful, and who can employ lobbyists, and who can have their CPAs and their lawyers to help them benefit from the roughly uh  eight thousand pages of the tax code. The average uh American person cant do it. You cant hire a lobbyist uh out of unemployment compensation checks."}]}

Let me just say that the situation as it exists now, because of this administrations policies, are not getting better. Were not moving toward a more secure area of the world. As a matter of fact the number of troops that the Sandinistas have accumulated since the administration started its covert activities has risen from 12,000 to 50,000, and of course the number of Soviet and Cuban advisors has also increased. I did not support the mining of the harbors in Nicaragua; it is a violation of international law. Congress did not support it and as a matter of fact, just this week, the Congress voted in cut off covert aid to Nicaragua unless and until a request is made and there is evidence of need for it, and the Congress approves it again in March. So if Congress doesnt get laid on, the covert activities which I opposed in Nicaragua, those CIA covert activities in that specific country, are not supported by the Congress. And believe it or not, not supported by the majority of people throughout the country."}]}

I think the question is whether or not the tax cuts and the tax system thats currently in our government, that our government uses, is fair; I think the tax system is unfair. But its not something that we can address in the short term. The tax cuts that Vice-President Bush and I got last, three years ago, that this president gave out, no, thats not fair. If you earn $200,000 a year, you got a $25,000 tax cut. If you earned between $20,000 and $40,000, you may have gotten about $1,000 between ten and twenty, close to a hundred dollars and if you made less than $10,000 with all the budget cuts that came down the line, you suffered a loss of $400. Thats not fair. Thats basically unfair and not only is it unfair, but economically it has darn near destroyed this country. Theres a $750 billion tax cut over a five-year period of time. Thats one of the reasons were facing these enormous deficits that we have today."}]}

In 1974, we had a so-called oil shock, wherein the price of OPEC oil was raised to an extraordinary degree. We had an even worse oil shock in 1979. In 1974, we had the worst recession, the deepest and most penetrating recession since the Second World War. The recession that resulted this time was the briefest since the Second World War. In addition, weve brought down inflation. Earlier this year, in the first quarter, we did have a very severe inflation pressure brought about by the OPEC price increase. It averaged about 18% in the first quarter of this year. In the second quarter, we had dropped it down to about 13%. The most recent figures, the last three months, on the third quarter of this year, the inflation rate is 7%  still too high, but it illustrates very vividly that in addition to providing an enormous number of jobs  nine million new jobs in the last three and a half years  that the inflationary threat is still urgent on us. I notice that Governor Reagan recently mentioned the Reagan-Kemp-Roth proposal. which his own running mate, George Bush, described as voodoo economics, and said that it would result in a 30% inflation rate. And Business Week, which is not a Democratic publication, said that this Reagan-Kemp-Roth proposal  and I quote them, I think  was completely irresponsible and would result in inflationary pressures which would destroy this nation. So our proposals are very sound and very carefully considered to stimulate jobs, to improve the industrial complex of this country, to create tools for American workers, and at the same time would be anti-inflationary in nature. So to add nine million new jobs, to control inflation, and to plan for the future with an energy policy now intact as a foundation is our plan for the years ahead."}]}

One of the commitments that I made was to deregulate the major industries of this country. Weve been remarkably successful, with the help of a Democratic Congress. We have deregulated the air industry, the rail industry, the trucking industry, financial institutions. Were now working on the communications industry. In addition to that, I believe that this element of discrimination is something that the South has seen so vividly as a blight on our region of the country which has now been corrected  not only racial discrimination but discrimination against people that have to work for a living  because we have been trying to pick ourselves up by our bootstraps, since the long depression years, and lead a full and useful life in the affairs of this country. We have made remarkable success. It is part of my consciousness and of my commitment to continue this progress.

The present tax structure is a disgrace to this country; its just a welfare program for the rich. As a matter of fact, uh  25 percent of the total tax deductions, go for only 1 percent of the richest people in this country, and over 50 percent of the tax uh credits go for the 14 percent of the richest people in this country. When Mr. Ford first became president in  in August of 1974, the first thing he did in  in October was to ask for a $4.7 billion increase in taxes on our people in the midst of the heaviest recession, since uh  since the great depression of nineteen uh  of the 1940s. In uh  January of 1975 he asked for a tax change: a $5.6 billion increase on low-and-middle-income private individuals, a six and a half billion dollar decrease on the corporations and the special interests. In uh  December of uh  1975 he vetoed the roughly 18 to 20 billion dollar uh tax-reduction bill that had been passed by the Congress, and then he came back later on in January of this year and he did advocate a $10 billion tax reduction, but it would be offset by a $6 billion increase this coming January in deductions for Social Security payments and for unemployment compensation. The whole philosophy of the Republican party, including uh  my opponent, has been to pile on taxes on low-income people to take em off on the corporations. As a matter fact, in  sin- since the late sixties when Mr. Nixon took office, weve had a reduction in uh  in the percentage of taxes paid by corporations from 30 percent down to about 20 percent. Weve had an increase in taxes paid by individuals, payroll taxes, from14 Percent up to 20 percent. And this is what the Republicans have done to us. And this is why a tax reform is so important."}]}

Uh  I began campaigning uh  twenty-two months ago. At that time, nobody thought I had a chance to win. Uh  very few people knew who I was. I came from a tiny town, as you know, Plains, and didnt hold public office, didnt have very much money. And my first organization was just four or five people plus my wife and my children, my three sons and their wives. And we won the nomination by going out into the streets  barbershops, beauty parlors, restaurants, stores, in factory shift lines also in farmers markets and livestock sale barns  and we talked a lot and we listened a lot and we learned from the American people. And we built up uh  an awareness among the uh  voters of this country, particularly those in whose primaries I entered  thirty of them, nobodys ever done that before  about who I was and what I stood for. Now we have a very, very wide-ranging group of advisers who help me prepare for these debates and who teach me about international economics, and foreign affairs, defense matters, health, education, welfare, government reorganization. Id say, several hundred of them. And theyre very fine and very highly qualified. The one major decision that I have made since acquiring the nomination, and I share this with President Ford, is the choice of a vice president. I think this should be indicative of the kind of leaders I would choose to help me if I am elected. I chose Senator Walter Mondale. And the only criterion I ever put forward in my own mind was who among the several million people in this country would be the best person qualified to be president, if something should happen to me and to join me in being vice president if I should serve out my term. And Im convinced now, more than I was when I got the nomination, that Walter Mondale was the right choice, And I believe this is a good indication of the kind of people I would choose in the future. Mr. Ford has had that same choice to make. I dont want to say anything critical of Senator Dole, but Ive never heard Mr. Ford say that that was his prim- primary consideration  Who is the best person I could choose in this country to be president of the United States? I feel completely at ease knowing that someday Senator Mondale might very well be president. In the last five pres- vice presidential uh  nominees, uh  incumbents, three of them have become president. But I think this is indicative of what I would do."}]}

In the last three months before an election, theyre always for the programs that they always fight the other three-and-one-half years. Uh  I remember when uh  Herbert Hoover was against uh  jobs for people. I remember when Alf Landon was against Social Security and uh  later President Nixon, sixteen years ago, was telling the public that John Kennedys proposals would bankrupt the country and would double the cost. The best thing to do is to look at the record uh  of Mr. Fords Administration and Mr. Nixons before his. Uh  we had last year a $65 billion deficit  the largest deficit in the history of our country  more of a deficit spending than we had in the entire eight-year period under President Johnson and President Kennedy. Weve got five hundred thousand more Americans out of jobs today than were out of work three months ago and since Mr. Fords been in office two years, weve had a 50 percent increase in unemployment from five million people out of work to two and a half million more people out of work and a total of seven and a half million. Weve also got uh  a comparison between himself and Mr. Nixon. Hes got four times the size of the deficits that Mr. Nixon even had himself. This uh  talking about more people at work  uh is distorted because with a 14 percent increase in the cost of living in the last uh  two years, it means that  that women and young people have had to go to work when they didnt want to because their fathers didnt make enough to pay the increased cost of uh  food and uh housing and clothing. We have uh  in this last uh two years alone a hundred and twenty billion dollars total deficits under President Ford and uh  at the same time weve had, in the last eight years, a doubling in the number of bankruptcies for small business: weve had a negative growth in our  in our national economy measured in real dollars. The take-home pay of a worker in this country is actually less now than it was in 1968  measured in real dollars. This is the kind of record thats there and talk about the future and a drastic change or conversion on the part of Mr. Ford as of last minute is one that just doesnt go."}]}

It took me about three years to completely reorganize the Georgia government. The last year I was in office uh  our budget was  was actually less than it was a year before, uh which showed a great uh improvement. Also, we had a  a 2 percent increase in the number of employees the last year. But it was a tremendous shift from administrative jobs into the delivery of services. For instance, we uh  completely revised our prison system. We established eighty-four new mental health treatment centers. And we shifted people out of administrative jobs into the field to deliver better services. The same thing will be done uh  at the federal government level. I  I accomplished this with s  substantial reductions in employees in some departments. For instance, in the Transportation Department uh we had uh  we cut back about 25 percent of the total number of employees. In giving our people better mental health care, we increased the number of employees. But the efficiency of it, the simplicity of it, the uh ability of people to understand their own government and control it was a  was a uh  substantial benefit derived from complete reorganization. We uh  have got to do that at the federal government level. If we dont, the bureaucratic mess is going to continue. Theres no way for our people now to understand what their government is. Theres no way to get the answer to a question. When you come to Washington to try to  as a governor  to try to begin a new program for your people, like uh the treatment of drug addicts, I found there were thirteen different federal agencies that I had to go to, to manage the uh drug treatment program. In the Georgia government we only had one agency responsible for drug treatment. This is the kind of change that would be made. And uh  it would be of  of tremendous benefit in long-range planning, in tight budgeting, uh saving the taxpayers money, making the government more efficient, cutting down on bureaucratic waste, having a clear delineation of authority and responsibility of employees, and giving our people a better chance to understand and control their government."}]}
