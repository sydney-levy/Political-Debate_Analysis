Hillary Clintons top priority when she became secretary of state was the Russian reset, the Russian reset. After the Russian reset, the Russians invaded Ukraine and took over Crimea. And the small and bullying leader of Russia is now dictating terms to the United States to the point where all the United States of America  the greatest nation on Earth  just withdraws from talks about a cease-fire while Vladimir Putin puts a missile defense system in Syria while he marshals the forces and begins  look, we have got to begin to lean into this with strong, broad-shouldered American leadership. It begins by rebuilding our military. And the Russians and the Chinese have been making enormous investments in the military. We have the smallest Navy since 1916. We have the lowest number of troops since the end of the Second World War. Weve got to work with the Congress, and Donald Trump will, to rebuild our military and project American strength in the world. But about Aleppo and about Syria, I truly do believe that what America ought to do right now is immediately establish safe zones, so that families and vulnerable families with children can move out of those areas, work with our Arab partners, real time, right now, to make that happen. And secondly, I just have to tell you that the provocations by Russia need to be met with American strength. And if Russia chooses to be involved and continue, I should say, to be involved in this barbaric attack on civilians in Aleppo, the United States of America should be prepared to use military force to strike military targets of the Assad regime to prevent them from this humanitarian crisis that is taking place in Aleppo. Theres a broad range of other things that we ought to do, as well. We ought to deploy a missile defense shield to the Czech Republic and Poland which Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama pulled back on out of not wanting to offend the Russians back in 2009."}]}

One of the greatest provisions for people like me, to be honest with you, I give up a lot when I run, because I knock out the tax code. And she could have done this years ago, by the way. Shes a United Statesshe was a United States senator. She complains that Donald Trump took advantage of the tax code. Well, why didnt she change it? Why didnt you change it when you were a senator? The reason you didnt is that all your friends take the same advantage that I do. And I do. You have provisions in the tax code that, frankly, we could change. But you wouldnt change it, because all of these people give you the money so you can take negative ads on Donald Trump. Butand I say that about a lot of things. You know, Ive heard Hillary complaining about so many different things over the years. I wish you would have done this. But shes been there for 30 years shes been doing this stuff. She never changed. And she never will change. She never will change. Were getting rid of carried interest provisions. Im lowering taxes actually, because I think its so important for corporations, because we have corporations leavingmassive corporations and little ones, little ones cant form. Were getting rid of regulations which goes hand in hand with the lowering of the taxes. But were bringing the tax rate down from 35 percent to 15 percent. Were cutting taxes for the middle class. And I will tell you, we are cutting them big league for the middle class. And I will tell you, Hillary Clinton is raising your taxes, folks. You can look at me. Shes raising your taxes really high. And what thats going to do is a disaster for the country. But she is raising your taxes and Im lowering your taxes. That in itself is a big difference. We are going to be thriving again. We have no growth in this country. Theres no growth. If China has a GDP of 7 percent, its like a national catastrophe. Were down at 1 percent. And thats, like, no growth. And were going lower, in my opinion. And a lot of it has to do with the fact that our taxes are so high, just about the highest in the world. And Im bringing them down to one of the lower in the world. And I think its so importantone of the most important things we can do. But she is raising everybodys taxes massively."}]}

I dont know that its going to work. If we dont win, we will have to run it and well have Obamacare, but it will be better run. But it no longer is Obamacare. Because without the individual mandate, its much different. Pre-existing conditions will always stay. What I would like to do is a much better health care, much better. Well always protect people with pre-existing  so Id like to terminate Obamacare, come up with a brand new beautiful health care. The Democrats will do it because therell be tremendous pressure on them. And we might even have the House by that time. And I think were going to win the House, okay? Youll see, but I think were gonna win the House. But come up with a better health care, always protecting people with pre-existing conditions  and one thing very important. We have 180 million people out there that have great private health care, far more than were talking about with Obamacare. Joe Biden is going to terminate all of those policies. These are people that love their health care, people that have been successful  middle income people  been successful.

Thank you, Senator. This is a very challenging time in the life of our nation. Weakened Americas place in the world after the leadership of Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama on the world stage has been followed by an economy that is truly struggling, stifled by an avalanche of more taxes, more regulation, Obamacare, the war on coal, and the kind of trade deals that have put American workers in the back seat. I think the best way that we can bring people together is through change in Washington, D.C. You know, I served in Washington, D.C., for 12 years in the Congress of the United States. And I served with many Republicans and Democrats, men and women of goodwill. The potential is there to really change the direction of this country, but its going to take leadership to do it. The American people want to see our nation standing tall on the world stage again. They want to see us supporting our military, rebuilding our military, commanding the respect of the world, and they want to see the American economy off to the races again. They want to see an American comeback. And Donald Trumps entire career has been about building. Its been about  its going through hardship just like a businessperson does and finding a way through smarts and ingenuity and resilience to fight forward and  when Donald Trump becomes president of the United States, were going to have a stronger America. When you hear him say he wants to make America great again, when we do that, I truly do believe the American people are going to be standing taller. Theyre going to see that real change can happen after decades of just talking about it. And when that happens, the American people are going to stand tall, stand together, and well have the kind of unity thats been missing for way too long."}]}

Far worse than people understand what's going on over there. But when she mentions about Israel all of a sudden--she hates Israel. She wouldn't even meet with Netanyahu when he went to Congress to make a very important speech. She refused to be there because she was at a sorority party of hers. She wanted to go to the sorority party. She hates Israel. If she's president, I believe that Israel will not exist within two years from now. And I've been pretty good at predictions. And I hope I'm wrong about that one. She hates Israel. At the same time in her own way she hates the Arab population because the whole place is gonna get blown up, Arabs, Jewish people, Israel. Israel will be gone. It would have never happened. Iran was broke under Donald Trump. Now Iran has $300 billion because they took off all the sanctions that I had. Iran had no money for Hamas or Hezbollah or any of the 28 different spheres of terror. And they are spheres of terror. Horrible terror. They had no money. It was a big story, and you know it. You covered it. Very well, actually. They had no money for terror. They were broke. Now they're a rich nation. And now what they're doing is spreading that money around. Look at what's happening with the Houthis and Yemen. Look at what's going on in the Middle East. This would have never happened. I will get that settled and fast.
