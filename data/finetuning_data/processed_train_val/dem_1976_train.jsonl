Ive got a little ways to go before I start doing that. But I have uh  an adequate background, I believe. I am a graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy, the first military graduate since uh  Eisenhower. Ive served as the Governor of Georgia and have traveled extensively in foreign countries and South America, Central America, Europe, the Middle East and in Japan. Ive traveled the last twenty-one months among the people of this country. Ive talked to them and Ive listened. And Ive seen at first hand, in a very vivid way, the deep hurt thats come to this country in the aftermath of Vietnam and Cambodia, Chile, and Pakistan, and Angola, and Watergate, CIA revelations. What we were formerly so proud of  the strength of our country, its uh  moral integrity, the representation in foreign affairs of what our people are, what our Constitution stands for, has been gone. And in the secrecy that has surrounded our foreign policy in the last few years, uh  the American people, the Congress have been excluded. I believe I know what this country ought to be. Ive uh  been one whos loved my nation as many Americans do, and I believe that theres no limit placed on what we can be in the future, if we can harness the tremendous resources  militarily, economically, and the stature of our people, the meaning of the Constitution, in the future. Every time weve made a serious mistake in foreign affairs, its been because the American people have been excluded from the process. If we can just tap the intelligence and ability, the sound common sense and the good judgment of the American people, we can once again have a foreign policy to make us proud instead of ashamed. And Im not gonna exclude the American people from that process in the future, as Mr. Ford and Kissinger have done. This is what it takes to have a sound foreign policy strong at home, strong defense, permanent commitments, not betray the principles of our country, and involve the American people and the Congress in the shaping of our foreign policy. Every time Mr. Ford speaks from a position of secrecy in negotiations, in secret  in secret treaties thatve been uh  pursued and achieved, in supporting dictatorships, in ignoring human rights, we are weak and the rest of the world knows it. So these are the ways that we can restore the strength of our country, and they dont require long experience in foreign policy. Nobody has that except a president who has served a long time or a secretary of state. But my background, my experience, my knowledge of the people of this country, my commitment to our principles that dont change  those are the best bases to correct the horrible mistakes of this administration and restore our own country to a position of leadership in the world."}]}

This uh  administrations record on environment is very bad. Uh  I think its accurate to say that the uh  strip-mining law which was passed twice by the Congress  uh  and was only like two votes I believe of being overridden  would have been good for the country. The claim that it would have put hundred and forty thousand miners out of work is uh  hard to believe, when at the time Mr. Ford vetoed it, the United Mine Workers was uh  supporting the bill. And I dont think they would have supported the uh  bill had they known that they would lose a hundred and forty thousand jobs. Theres been a consistent policy on the part of this administration to lower or delay enforcement of air pollution standards and water pollution standards. And under both President Nixon and Ford, monies have been impounded that wouldve gone to uh  cities and others to control uh  water pollution. We have no energy policy. We, I think, are the only developed nation in the world that has no comprehensive energy policy, to permit us to plan in an orderly way how to shift from increasing the scarce uh  energy uh  forms: oil, and have research and development concentrated on the increased use of coal, which I strongly favor. The research and development to be used primary to make the coal burning uh  be clean. We need a heritage trust program, similar to the one we had in Georgia, to set aside additional lands that have uh  geological and archeological importance, uh natural areas for enjoyment. Uh  the lands that Mr. Ford uh  brags about having approved are in Alaska and they are enormous in uh  in size. But as far as the accessibility of them by the American people, its very uh  far in the future. Weve taken no strong position in the uh  control of pollution of our oceans, and I would say the worst uh  threat to the environment of all is nuclear proliferation. And this administration, having been in office now for two years or more, has still not taken strong and bold action to stop the proliferation of nuclear waste around the world, particularly plutonium. Those are some brief remarks about the failures of this administration. I would do the opposite in every respect."}]}

The Congress can modify the supply of money by modifying the income uh tax laws. The president can modify the uh  economic structure of a country by public statements and general attitudes in the budget that he proposes. The Federal Reserve has uh  an independent status that ought to be preserved; I think that Mr. uh  Burns did take a typical, erroneous Republican attitude in the 1973 year when inflation was so high. They assumed that the uh  inflation rate was because of excessive demand and uh  therefore put into effect tight constraint on the economy, very high interest rates, which is typical also of the Republican administration, uh  tried to increase the uh  the tax uh  payments by individuals, and cut the tax payments by corporations. I would have uh  done it opposite. I think the uh  problem shouldve been addressed by increasing productivity, by having uh  put  put people back to work so they could purchase more goods, lower income taxes on individuals, perhaps raise them, if necessary, on corporations in comparison. But uh  Mr. Burns uh  in that respect made a very serious mistake. I would not wanna destroy the  the independence of the uh Federal Reserve  uh Board.

If you put 50 tons of TNT in each one of railroad cars, you would have a carload of TNT  a trainload of TNT stretching across this nation. Thats one major war explosion in a warhead. We have thousands, equivalent of megaton, or million tons, of TNT warheads.

I think the American people have only one  uh requirement  that the facts about Mayaguez be given to them accurately and completely. Mr. Ford has been there for eighteen months. He had the facts that were released today immediately after the Mayaguez incident. I understand that the report today is accurate. Mr. Ford has said, I believe, that it was accurate, and that the White House made no attempt to block the issuing of that report. I dont know if thats exactly accurate or not. I understand that both the  the uh  Department of State and the Defense Department have approved the accuracy of todays report, or yesterdays report, and also the National Security Agency. I dont know what was right, or what was wrong, or what was done. The only thing I believe is that whatever the  the knowledge was that Mr. Ford had should have been given to the American people eighteen months ago, immediately after the Mayaguez uh  incident occurred. This is uh  what the American people want. When something happens that endangers our security, or when something happens that threatens our stature in the world, or when American people are endangered by the actions of a foreign country, uh  just forty uh sailors on the Mayaguez, we obviously have to move aggressively and quickly to rescue them. But then after the immediate action is taken, I believe the president has an obligation to tell the American people the truth and not wait eighteen months later for the report to be issued."}]}

First of all is to recognize a tremendous economic strength in this country and to set the putting to  back to work of our people as a top priority. This is uh  an effort that ought to be done primarily by strong leadership in the White House, the inspiration of our people, the tapping of uh  business, agriculture, industry, labor and government at all levels to work on this uh project. Well never have uh  an end to the inflationary spiral, and well never have a balanced budget until we get our people back to work. There are several things that can be done specifically that are not now being done. First of all, to channel research and development funds into areas that will provide uh large numbers of jobs. Secondly, we need to have a commitment in the uh private sector uh  to cooperate with government in matters like housing. Here a very small investment of taxpayers money  in the housing field can bring large numbers of extra jobs, and the guarantee of mortgage loans, and the uh  putting forward of uh  two-0-two programs for housing for older people and so forth to cut down the roughly 20 percent unemployment that now exists in the  in the construction industry. Another thing is to deal with our  uh needs in the central cities, where the unemployment rate is extremely high: sometimes among minority groups, or those who dont speak English, or whore black, or young people, or  40 percent of the employment. Here a CCC type program would be appropriate to channel money into the ah  cha- in  in into the sharing with the private sector and also local and state governments to employ young people who are now out of work. Another very important  uh aspect of our  uh economy would be to increase production in every way possible, uh to hold down  uh taxes on individuals, and to uh shift the tax burdens onto those who have avoided paying taxes in the past. These uh  kinds of specific things, uh none of which are being done now, would be a great help in  in reducing uh unemployment. There is uh  uh an additional factor that needs to be done and covered very  very succinctly, and that is, to make sure that we have a good relationship between management  business on the one hand, and labor, on the other. In a > Transfer interrupted! ery high, we might channel specific uh targeted job  job  uh opportunities by paying part of the salary of unemployed people  uh and also sharing with uh  local governments the uh  payment of salaries which would uh  let us cut down the unemployment rate much lower, before we hit the inflationary level. But I believe that by the end of the first four years of uh  of the next term we could have the unemployment down to 3 percent adult unemployment, which is about uh  4 to 4 and a half percent overall uh controlled inflation rate and have a uh balance of growth of about  uh 4 to 6 percent, around 5 percent which would give us a balanced budget."}]}

I was in uh  a city in uh  Pennsylvania not too long ago, near here, and uh  there were about four or five thousand people in the audience  it was on a  on a train trip. And I said, How many uh  adults here are out of work? About a thousand raised their hands. Mr. Ford uh  actually has fewer people now in the private sector in non-farm jobs than when he took office. And still he talks about  uh success. Seven point nine percent unemployment is a terrible tragedy in this country. He says hes learned how to match unemployment with inflation. Thats right. Weve got the highest inflation weve had in twenty-five years right now, except under this administration, and that was fifty years ago. And weve got uh  the highest unemployment weve had uh  under Mr. Fords administration, since the Great Depression. This affects human beings, and  and his insensitivity in providing those people a chance to work has made this a welfare administration, and not a work administration. He hasnt saved $9 billion with his vetoes. Theres only been uh  a net savings of $4 billion. And the cost in unemployment compensation, welfare compensation, and lost revenues has increased $23 billion in the last two years. This is a  a typical attitude that really causes havoc in peoples lives, and then its covered over by saying that our country has naturally got a 6 percent unemployment rate, or 7 percent unemployment rate and a 6 percent inflation. Its a travesty. It shows a lack of leadership. And weve never had a president since the War between the States that vetoed more bills. Mr. Ford has vetoed four times as many bills as Mr. Nixon  per year. And eleven of em have been overridden. One of his bills that was overridden  he only got one vote in the Senate and seven votes in the House, from Republicans."}]}

In all those elements, Governor Reagan has repeatedly spoken out against them, which, to me, shows a very great insensitivity to giving deprived families a better chance in life. This, to me, is a very important difference between him and me in this election, and I believe the American people will judge accordingly. There is no doubt in my mind that in the downtown central cities, with the, with the new commitment on an energy policy, with a chance to revitalize homes and to make them more fuel efficient, with a chance for our synthetic fuels program, solar power, this will give us an additional opportunity for jobs which will pay rich dividends."}]}

Its not an opinion; its a fact. And when the President was asked the other day, What do you want to cut in the budget?, he said, Cut those things I asked for but didnt get. Thats Social Security and Medicare. The second fact is that the housing unit for senior citizens that the President dedicated in Buffalo was only made possible through a Federal assistance program for senior citizens that the Presidents budget sought to terminate.

Weve got seven and a half million people out of jobs. Since hes been in office, two and a half million more American people have lost their jobs. In the last four months alone, five hundred thousand Americans have gone on the unemployment roll. In the last month, weve had a net loss of one hundred and sixty-three thousand jobs. Anybody who says that the inflation rate is in good shape now ought to talk to the housewives. One of the overwhelming results that Ive seen in the polls is that people feel that you cant plan anymore. Theres no way to make a prediction that my family might be able to own a home or to put my kid through college. Savings accounts are losing money instead of gaining money. Inflation is robbing us. Under the present administration  Nixons and Fords  weve had three times the inflation rate that we experienced under President Johnson and President Kennedy. The economic growth is less than half today what it was at the beginning of this year. And housing starts  he compares the housing starts with last year. I dont blame him, because in 1975 we had fewer housing starts in this country, fewer homes built, than any year since 1940. Thats thirty-five years. And weve got a 35 percent unemployment rate in many areas of this country among construction workers. And Mr. Ford hasnt done anything about it. And I think this shows a callous indifference to the families that have suffered so much. He has vetoed bills passed by Congress within the congressional budget guidelines job opportunities for two million Americans. Well never have a balanced budget, well never meet the needs of our people, well never control the inflationary spiral, as long as we have seven and a half or eight million people out of work, who are looking for jobs. And weve probably got two and a half more million people who are not looking for jobs any more, because theyve given up hope. That is a very serious indictment of this administration.

Being the candidate for vice-president of my party is the greatest honor I have ever had. But its not only a personal achievement for Geraldine Ferraro  and certainly not only the bond that I feel as I go across this country with women throughout the country. I wouldnt be standing here if Fritz Mondale didnt have the courage and my party didnt stand for the values that it does  the values of fairness and equal opportunity. Those values make our country strong and the future of this country and how strong it will be is what this election is all about. Over the last two months Ive been traveling all over the country talking to the people about the future. I was in Kentucky and I spoke to the Dyhouse family. He works for a car dealer and hes worried about the deficits and how high interest rates are going to affect his job. Every place I go I see young parents with their children and they say to me what are we going to do to stop this nuclear arms race. I was in Dayton, Ohio, a week and a half ago and I sat with the Allen family who live next door to a toxic dump and theyre very, very concerned about the fact that those toxics are seeping into the water that they and their neighbors drink. Now those people love this country and theyre patriotic. But its not the patriotism that youre seeing in the commercials as you watch television these days. Their patriotism is not only a pride in the country as it is, but a pride in this country that is strong enough to meet the challenges of the future. Do you know when we find jobs for the eight and a half million people who are unemployed in this country, you know well make our economy stronger and that will be a patriotic act. When we reduce the deficits and we cut interest rates, and I know the president doesnt believe that, but its so  we cut those interest rates young people can buy houses, thats pro-family and that will be a patriotic act. When we educate our children  good Lord, theyre going to be able to compete in a world economy and that makes us stronger and thats a patriotic act. When we stop the arms race, we make this a safer, saner world, and thats a patriotic act, and when we keep the peace young men dont die, and thats a patriotic act. Those are the keys to the future and who can be the leader for the future? When Walter Mondale was attorney general of Minnesota, he led the fight for a man who could not afford to get justice because he couldnt afford a lawyer; when he was in the Senate he fought for child nutrition programs, he wrote the Fair Housing Act, he even investigated the concerns and the abuses of migrant workers. And why did he do that? Those werent popular causes. You know, no one had ever heard of Clarence Gideon, the man without a lawyer. Children dont vote and migrant workers exactly a powerful lobby in this country, but he did it because it was right.

Under the 1981 tax bill, people making $200,000 a year got $60,000 in tax relief over 3 years, while people making $30,000 a year, all taxes considered, got no relief at all or their taxes actually went up. Thats why my proposal protects everybody from $25,000 a year or less against any tax increases, and treats those $70,000 and under in a way that is more beneficial than the way the President proposes with a sales tax or a flat tax. What does this mean in real life? Well, the other day, Vice President Bush disclosed his tax returns to the American people. Hes one of the wealthiest Americans, and hes our Vice President. In 1981 I think he paid about 40 percent in taxes. In 1983, as a result of these tax preferences, he paid a little over 12 percent, 12.8 percent in taxes. That meant that he paid a lower percent in taxes than the janitor who cleaned up his office or the chauffeur who drives him to work. I believe we need some fairness. And thats why Ive proposed what I think is a fair and a responsible proposal that helps protect these people whove already got no relief or actually got a tax increase."}]}

In the first place, uh  as is the case with the environmental policy and the energy policy that I just described, and the policy for nonproliferation of uh  of nuclear waste, this administration has no urban policy. Its impossible for mayors or governors to cooperate with the resident, because they cant anticipate whats gonna happen next. A mayor of a city like New York, for instance, needs to know uh  eighteen months or two years ahead of time what responsibility the city will have in administration and in financing  in things like housing, uh  pollution control, uh  crime control, education, welfare and health. This has not been done, unfortunately. I remember the headline in the Daily News that said, Ford to New York: Drop Dead. I think its very important that our cities know that they have a partner in the federal government. Quite often Congress has passed laws in the past designed to help people with uh  the ownership of homes and with the control of crime and with adequate health care and education programs and so forth. Uh  those uh programs were designed to help those who need it most. And quite often this has been in the very poor people and neighborhoods in the downtown urban centers. Because of the uh  great -ly- greatly uh  advantaged uh  tho- per  persons who live in the suburbs, better education, better organization, more articulate, more aware of what the laws are, quite often this money has been channeled out of the downtown centers where its needed. Also I favor all revenue sharing money being used for local governments, and also to remove prohibitions in the use of revenue sharing money so that it can be used to improve education, and health care. We have now uh  for instance only 7 percent of the total education cost being financed by the federal government. When uh  the Nixon-Ford Administration started, this was 10 percent. Thats a 30 percent reduction in the portion that the federal government contributes to education in just eight years. And as you know, the education cost has gone up uh  tremendously. The last point is that the major  uh thrust has gotta be to put people back to work. Weve got an extraordinarily high unemployment rate among downtown urban ghetto areas, uh  particularly among the very poor and particularly among minority groups, sometimes 50 or 60 percent. And the concentration of employment opportunities in those areas would help greatly not only to reestablish the tax base, but also to help reduce the extraordinary welfare cost. One of the major responsibilities on the shoulders of uh  New York City is to  is to finance welfare. And I favor a shifting of the welfare cost away from the local governments altogether. And over a longer period of time, let the federal government begin to absorb part of it thats now paid by the state governments. Those things would help a great deal with the cities, but we still have a  a very serious problem there."}]}

If President Brezhnev said, we will scrap this treaty, negotiated under three American Presidents over a seven-year period of time, we insist upon nuclear superiority as a basis for future negotiations, and we believe that the launching of a nuclear arms race is a good basis for future negotiations, its obvious that I, as President, and all Americans, would reject such a proposition. This would mean the resumption of a very dangerous nuclear arms race. It would be very disturbing to American people. It would change the basic tone and commitment that our nation has experienced ever since the Second World War, with al Presidents, Democratic and Republican. And it would also be very disturbing to our allies, all of whom support this nuclear arms treaty. In addition to that, the adversarial relationship between ourselves and the Soviet Union would undoubtedly deteriorate very rapidly. This attitude is extremely dangerous and belligerent in its tone, although its said with a quiet voice."}]}

At the same time, as I have said earlier, we have added about nine million net new jobs in that period of time  a record never before achieved. Also, the new energy policy has been predicated on two factors: One is conservation, which requires sacrifice, and the other one, increase in production of American energy, which is going along very well  more coal this year than ever before in American history, more oil and gas wells drilled this year than ever before in history. The new economic revitalization program that we have in mind, which will be implemented next year, would result in tax credits which would let business invest in new tools and new factories to create even more new jobs  about one million in the next two years. And we also have planned a youth employment program which would encompass 600,000 jobs for young people. This has already passed the House, and it has an excellent prospect to pass the Senate."}]}

As a matter of fact, during this current year uh we are shipping Iran, or have contracted to ship to Iran, about seven and a half billion dollars worth of arms and also to Saudi Arabia, about seven and a half billion dollars worth of arms.

We in effect tried to make Israel the scapegoat for the problems in the Middle East.

When Mr. Reagan raised this uh  question in Florida uh  Mr. Ford not only disavowed his instructions, but he also even dropped, parenthetically, the use of the word detente. I would never give up complete control or practical control of the Panama Canal Zone, but I would continue to negotiate with the Panamanians. When the original treaty was signed back in the early 1900s, when Theodore Roosevelt was president, Panama retained sovereignty over the Panama Canal Zone. We retained control as though we had sovereignty. Now I would be willing to go ahead with negotiations. I believe that we could share more fully responsibilities for the Panama Canal Zone with Panama.

Quite frankly now what is being done by this administration is an Americanizing of a regional conflict. Theyre moving in militarily instead of promoting the Contadora process, which, as you know, is the process that is in place with the support of Mexico and Colombia and Panama and Venezuela. Instead of supporting the process, our administration has in Nicaragua been supporting covert activities to keep that revolution going in order to overthrow the Sandinista government; in El Salvador was not pushing the head of the government to move toward correction of the civil rights; human rights problems that existed there, and now this administration seems almost befuddled by the fact that Nicaragua is moving to participate in the Contadora process, and El Salvador is, through its President Duarte, is reaching out to the guerrillas in order to negotiate a peace.

I, too, recall when Vice President Bush was running in the primary against President Reagan and he called the program voodoo economics, and it was and it is. We are facing absolutely massive deficits; this administration has chosen to ignore it; the president has failed to put forth a plan to deal with those deficits and if everything believes that everything is corning up roses, perhaps the vice-president should join me as I travel around the country and speak to people. People in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, are not terribly thrilled with whats happening in the economy because theyre standing in the light of a closed plant because theyve lost their jobs.

Mencken said that for every problem theres a simple answer. It would be neat and plausible and wrong. The fact is that this nation, in the eight years before I became President, had its own military strength decreased. Seven out of eight years, the budget commitments for defense went down, 37% in all. Since Ive been in office, weve had a steady, carefully planned, methodical but, very effective increase in our commitment for defense. But what weve done is use that enormous power and prestige and military strength of the United States to preserve the peace. Weve not only kept peace for our own country, but weve been able to extend the benefits of peace to others. In the Middle East, weve worked for a peace treaty between Israel and Egypt, successfully, and have tied ourselves together with Israel and Egypt in a common defense capability. This is a very good step forward for our nations security, and well continue to do as we have done in the past. I might also add that there are decisions that are made in the Oval Office by every President which are profound in nature. There are always trouble spots in the world, and how those troubled areas are addressed by a President alone in that Oval Office affects our nation directly, the involvement of the United States and also our American interests. That is a basic decision that has to be made so frequently, by every President who serves. That is what I have tried to do successfully by keeping our country at peace."}]}

To negotiate with the Soviet Union a balanced, controlled, observable, and then reducing levels of atomic weaponry, there is a disturbing pattern in the attitude of Governor Reagan. He has never supported any of those arms control agreements  the limited test ban, SALT I, nor the Antiballistic Missile Treaty, nor the Vladivostok Treaty negotiated with the Soviet Union by President Ford  and now he wants to throw into the wastebasket a treaty to control nuclear weapons on a balanced and equal basis between ourselves and the Soviet Union, negotiated over a seven-year period, by myself and my two Republican predecessors. The Senate has not voted yet on the Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty. There have been preliminary skirmishing in the committees of the Senate, but the Treaty has never come to the floor of the Senate for either a debate or a vote. Its understandable that a Senator in the preliminary debates can make an irresponsible statement, or, maybe, an ill-advised statement. Youve got 99 other senators to correct that mistake, if it is a mistake. But when a man who hopes to be President says, take this treaty, discard it, do not vote, do not debate, do not explore the issues, do not finally capitalize on this long negotiation  that is a very dangerous and disturbing thing."}]}

And we cut those three hundred  uh agencies and so forth down substantially. We eliminated two hundred and seventy-eight of them. We set up a simple structure of government that could be administrated fairly and it was a  a tremendous success. It hasnt been undone since I was there. It resulted also in an ability to reshape our court system, our prison system, our education system, our mental health programs and  and a clear assignment of responsibility and  and authority and also to have uh our people once again understanding control our government.

That has escalated now to sixteen and a half million dollars, in the last uh Republican administration. This needs to be changed. We need to put the responsibilities back on the cabinet members. We also need to have a great reduction in agencies and programs. For instance, we now have uh  in the health area three hundred and two different programs administered by eleven major departments and agencies, sixty other advisory commissions responsible for this. Medicaids in one agency; Medicare is in a different one. The  the check on the quality of health care is in a different one. None of them uh are responsible for health care itself.

And thats why this enormous national debt, engineered by this administration, is harming these countries in fueling this immigration. These high interest rates  real rates that have doubled under this administration  have had the same effect on Mexico and so on, and the cost of repaying those debts is so enormous that it results in massive unemployment, hardship, and heartache. And that drives our friends to the south up into our region, and we need to end those deficits as well."}]}

The question of agriculture came up a minute ago. Net farm income is off 50 percent in the last 3 years, and every farmer knows it. And the effect of these economic policies is like a massive grain embargo, which has caused farm exports to drop 20 percent. Its been a big failure. I opposed the grain embargo in my administration.

Its a matter of leadership or no leadership. President Eisenhower worked with a Democratic Congress very well. Even President Nixon, because he was a strong leader at least, worked with a Democratic Congress very well. Uh  Mr. Ford has vetoed, as I said earlier, four times as many bills per year as Mr. Nixon. Mr. Ford quite often puts forward a program just as a public relations stunt, and never tries to put it through the Congress by working with the Congress. I think under presidents For- uh  Nixon and Eisenhower they passed about 60 to 75 percent of their legislation. This year Mr. Ford will not pass more than 26 percent of all the legislative proposals he puts forward. This is government by stalemate, and weve seen almost a complete breakdown in the proper relationship between the president, who represents this country, and the Congress, who collectively also represent this country. Weve had uh  Republican presidents before whove tried to run against a Democratic  uh Congress. And I dont think its uh  the Congress is Mr. Fords opponent; but if uh  if  if he insists that uh  that I be responsible for the Democratic Congress, of which Im  have not been a part, then I think its only fair that he be responsible for the Nixon administration in its entirety, of which he was a part. That, I think, is a good balance. But the point is, that  that a president ought to lead this country. Mr. Ford, so far as I know, except for avoiding another Watergate, has not accomplished one single major program for this country. And theres been a constant squabbling between the president and the Congress, and thats not the way this country ought to be run. I might go back to one other thing. Mr. Ford has uh  misquoted an AP uh  news story that was in error to begin with. That story reported several times that I would lower taxes for low and middle-income families and uh  that correction was delivered to the White House and I am sure that the president knows about this uh  correction, but he still insists uh  on repeating an erroneous statement."}]}

If the uh  list was, uh  in my opinion, fairly uniform, if there was no outstanding person, then I would undoubtedly choose someone who would most accurately reflect my own basic politi- political philosophy as best I could determine it. Which would be uh  to continue the progress that has been made under the last two uh  courts  the Warren Court and the Burger Court. I would also like to uh  completely revise our criminal justice system  to do some of the things at the federal level in court reform that Ive just described, as has been done in Georgia and other states.

It is obvious that we should have a commitment to them, that Social Security benefits should not be taxed and that there would be no peremptory change in the standards by which Social Security payments are made to retired people. We also need to continue to index Social Security payments, so that if inflation rises, the Social Security payments would rise a commensurate degree to let the buying power of a Social Security check continue intact. In the past, the relationship between Social Security and Medicare has been very important to providing some modicum of aid for senior citizens in the retention of health benefits. Governor Reagan, as a matter of fact, began his political career campaigning around this nation against Medicare. Now, we have an opportunity to move toward national health insurance, with an emphasis on the prevention of disease, an emphasis on out-patient care, not in-patient care; an emphasis on hospital cost containment to hold down the cost of hospital care far those who are ill, an emphasis on catastrophic health insurance, so that if a family is threatened with being wiped out economically because of a very high medical bill, then the insurance would help pay for it. These are the kinds of elements of a national health insurance, important to the American people. Governor Reagan, again, typically is against such a proposal."}]}

These uh  characteristics of our country have been endangered under Mr. Ford. Were no longer respected in a showdown vote in the United Nations or in  in any other international council were lucky to get 20 percent of the other nations to vote with us. Our allies feel that weve neglected them. The so-called Nixon shock against Japan had weakened our relationships there. Under this administration weve also had an inclination to keep separate the European countries, thinking that if they are separate, then we can dominate them and proceed with our secret, Lone Ranger-type diplomatic efforts. I would uh  also like to point out that we, in this country, have let our economy go down the drain. The worst inflation since the Great Depression. The highest unemployment of any developed nation of the world. We have a higher unemployment rate in this country than Great Britain, and West Germany. Our unemployment rate is twice as high as it is in Italy; its three or four times as high as it is  as it is in Japan. And that terrible circumstance in this country is exported overseas. We comprise about 30 percent of the worlds economic trade power influence. And when were weak at home  weaker than all our allies  that weakness weakens the whole free world. So strong economy is very important. Another thing that we need to do is to reestablish the good relationships that we ought to have between the United States and our natural allies and friends. They have felt neglected. And using that base of strength, and using the idealism, the honesty, the predictability, the commitment, the integrity of our own country, thats where our strength lies. And that would permit us to deal with the developing nations in a position of strength. Under this administration weve had a continuation of the so-called balance of power politics, where everything is looked on as a struggle between us on the one side, the Soviet Union on the other. Our allies  the smaller countries get trampled in the rush. What we need is to try to seek individualized bilateral relationships with countries, regardless of their size, and to establish world-order politics, which means that we want to preserve peace through strength. We also wanna revert back to the stature and the respect that our country had in previous administrations. Now, I cant say when this can come. But I can guarantee it will not come if Gerald Ford is reelected and this present policy is continued; it will come if Im elected."}]}

I notice that his task force that is working for his future plans had some of their ideas revealed in The Wall Street Journal this week. One of those ideas was to repeal the minimum wage, and several times this year, Governor Reagan has said that the major cause of unemployment is the minimum wage. This is a heartless kind of approach to the working families of our country, which is typical of many Republican leaders of the past, but, I think, has been accentuated under Governor Reagan. In California  Im surprised Governor Reagan brought this up  he had the three largest tax increases in the history of that state under his administration. He more than doubled state spending while he was Governor  122% increase  and had between a 20% and 30% increase in the number of employees"}]}

We have had for many years, understandably, a system of restraints on high technology because the Soviets are behind us. And any research or development along the Star Wars schemes would inevitably involve our most advanced computers, our most advanced engineering. And the thought that we would share this with the Soviet Union is, in my opinion, a total non-STARTer. I would not let the Soviet Union get their hands on it at all. Now, whats wrong with Star Wars? Theres nothing wrong with the theory of it. If we could develop a principle that would say both sides could fire all their missiles and no one would get hurt, I suppose its a good idea. But the fact of it is were so far away from research that even comes close to that, that the Director of Engineering Research at the Defense Department said to get there we would have to solve eight problems, each of which are more difficult than the atomic bomb and the Manhattan project. It would cost something like a trillion dollars to test and deploy weapons. The second thing is this all assumes that the Soviets wouldnt respond in kind. And they always do. We dont get behind. They wont get behind. And thats been the tragic story of the arms race. We have more at stake in space satellites than they do. If we could stop, right now, the testing and the deployment of these space weapons  and the Presidents proposals go clear beyond research; if it was just research we wouldnt have any argument, because maybe someday, somebody will think of something  but to commit this nation to a buildup of antisatellite and space weapons at this time, in their crude state, would bring about an arms race thats very dangerous indeed. One final point. The most dangerous aspect of this proposal is, for the first time, we would delegate to computers the decision as to whether to start a war. Thats dead wrong. There wouldnt be time for a President to decide; it would be decided by these remote computers. It might be an oil fire, it might be a jet exhaust, the computer might decide its a missile  and off we go."}]}

Our objectives ought to be to strengthen the democracies, to stop Communist and other extremist influences, and stabilize the community in that area. To do that we need a three-pronged attack: one is military assistance to our friends who are being pressured; secondly, a strong and sophisticated economic aid program and human rights program that offers a better life and a sharper alternative to the alternative offered by the totalitarians who oppose us; and finally, a strong diplomatic effort that pursues the possibilities of peace in the area. This brings up the whole question of what Presidential leadership is all about. I think the lesson in Central America, this recent embarrassment in Nicaragua where we are giving instructions for hired assassins, hiring criminals, and the rest  all of this has strengthened our opponents. A President must not only assure that were tough, but we must also be wise and smart in the exercise of that power. We saw the same thing in Lebanon, where we spent a good deal of Americas assets. But because the leadership of this government did not pursue wise policies, we have been humiliated, and our opponents are stronger. The bottom line of national strength is that the President must be in command, he must lead. And when a President doesnt know that submarine missiles are recallable, says that 70 percent of our strategic forces are conventional, discovers 3 years into his administration that our arms control efforts have failed because he didnt know that most Soviet missiles were on land  these are things a President must know to command. A President is called the Commander in Chief. And hes called that because hes supposed to be in charge of the facts and run our government and strengthen our nation."}]}

Our country is not strong anymore; were not respected anymore. We can only be strong overseas if were strong at home; and when I became president well not only be strong in those areas but also in defense  a defense capability second to none. Weve lost in our foreign policy, the character of the American people. Weve uh  ignored or excluded the American people and the Congress from participation in the shaping of our foreign policy. Its been one of secrecy and exclusion. In addition to that weve had a chance to became now, contrary to our long-standing beliefs and principles, the arms merchant of the whole world. Weve tried to buy success from our enemies, and at the same time weve excluded from the process the normal friendship of our allies. In addition to that weve become fearful to compete with the Soviet Union on an equal basis. We talk about detente. The Soviet Union knows what they want in detente, and theyve been getting it. We have not known what weve wanted and weve been out-traded in almost every instance. The other point I wanna make is about our defense. Weve got to be a nation blessed with a defense capability thats efficient, tough, capable, well organized, narrowly focused  fighting capability. The ability to fight, if necessary, is the best way to avoid the chance for, or the requirement to fight. And the last point I wanna make is this: Mr. Ford, Mr. Kissinger have uh  continued on with the policies and failures of Richard Nixon. Even the Republican platform has criticized the lack of leadership in Mr. Ford and theyve criticized the foreign policy of this administration. This is one instance where I agree with  with the Republican platform. I might say this in closing, and that is that as far as foreign policy goes, Mr. Kissinger has been the president of this country. Mr. Ford has shown an absence of leadership, and an absence of a grasp of what this country is and what it ought to be. Thats got to be changed.

First of all, there is the historical perspective that I just described. This is a contest between a Democrat in the mainstream of my party, as exemplified by the actions that I have taken in the Oval Office the last four years, as contrasted with Governor Reagan, who in most cases does typify his party, but in some cases, there is a radical departure by him from the heritage of Eisenhower and others. The most important crucial difference in this election campaign, in my judgment, is the approach to the control of nuclear weaponry and the inclination to control or not to control the spread of atomic weapons to other nations who dont presently have it, particularly terrorist nations. The inclination that Governor Reagan has exemplified in many troubled times since he has been running for President  I think since 1968  to inject American military forces in places like North Korea, to put a blockade around Cuba this year, or in some instances, to project American forces into a fishing dispute against the small nation of Ecuador on the west coast of South America. This is typical of his long-standing inclination, on the use of American power, not to resolve disputes diplomatically and peacefully, but to show that the exercise of military power is best proven by the actual use of it. Obviously, no President wants war, and I certainly do not believe that Governor Reagan, if he were President, would want war, but a President in the Oval Office has to make a judgment on almost a daily basis about how to exercise the enormous power of our country for peace, through diplomacy, or in a careless way in a belligerent attitude which has exemplified his attitudes in the past."}]}

In the past, those minority groups have often been excluded from participation in the affairs of government.

And when people vote, I think youre going to see a very strong verdict by the American people that they favor the approach that Im talking about. The American people want arms control. They dont want this arms race. And they dont want this deadly new effort to bring weapons into the heavens. And they want an American foreign policy that leads toward a safer world. The American people see this debt, and they know its got to come down. And if it wont come down, the economys going to slow down, maybe go into a recession. They see this tremendous influx and swamping of cheap foreign imports in this country that has cost over 3 million jobs, given farmers the worst year in American history. And they know this debt must come down as well, because its unfair to our children. The American people want this environment protected. They know that these toxic waste dumps should have been cleaned up a long time ago, and they know that peoples lives and health are being risked, because weve had an administration that has been totally insensitive to the law and the demand for the protection of the environment. The American people want their children educated. They want to get our edge back in science, and they want a policy headed by the President that helps close this gap thats widening between the United States and Europe and Japan. The American people want to keep opening doors. They want those civil rights laws enforced. They want the equal rights amendment ratified. They want equal pay for comparable effort for women. And they want it because theyve understood from the beginning that when we open doors, were all stronger, just as we were at the Olympics. I think as you make the case, the American people will increasingly come to our cause."}]}

Im sure that we all accept and admire his commitment to his faith, and we are strengthened, all of us, by that fact. I am a son of a Methodist minister. My wife is the daughter of a Presbyterian minister. And I dont know if Ive been born again, but I know I was born into a Christian family. And I believe I have sung at more weddings and more funerals than anybody ever to seek the Presidency. Whether that helps or not, I dont know. I have a deep religious faith. Our family does. It is fundamental. Its probably the reason that Im in politics. I think our faith tells us, instructs us, about the moral life that we should lead. And I think were all together on that. What bothers me is this growing tendency to try to use ones own personal interpretation of faith politically, to question others faith, and to try to use the instrumentalities of government to impose those views on others. All history tells us that thats a mistake. When the Republican platform says that from here on out, were going to have a religious test for judges before theyre selected for the Federal court, and then Jerry Falwell announces that that means they get at least two Justices of the Supreme Court, I think thats an abuse of faith in our country. This nation is the most religious nation on Earth  more people go to church and synagogues than any other nation on Earth  and its because we kept the politicians and the state out of the personal exercise of our faith. Thats why faith in the United States is pure and unpolluted by the intervention of politicians. And I think if we want to continue  as I do  to have a religious nation, lets keep that line and never cross it."}]}

When I was campaigning in 1976, everywhere I went, the mayors and local officials were in despair about the rapidly deteriorating central cities of our nation. We initiated a very fine urban renewal program, working with the mayors, the governors, and other interested officials. This has been a very successful effort. Thats one of the main reasons that weve had such an increase in the number of people employed. Of the nine million people put to work in new jobs since Ive been in office, 1.3 million of those has been among black Americans, and another million among those who speak Spanish. We now are planning to continue the revitalization program with increased commitments of rapid transit, mass transit. Under the windfall profits tax, we expect to spend about $43 billion in the next 10 years to rebuild the transportation systems of our country. We also are pursuing housing programs. Weve had a 73% increase in the allotment of Federal funds for improved education. These are the kinds of efforts worked on a joint basis with community leaders, particularly in the minority areas of the central cities that have been deteriorating so rapidly in the past. Its very important to us that this be done with the full involvement of minority citizens. I have brought into the top level, top levels of government, into the White House, into administrative offices of the Executive branch, into the judicial system, highly qualified black and Spanish citizens and women who in the past had been excluded. I noticed that Governor Reagan said that when he was a young man that there was no knowledge of a racial problem in this country. Those who suffered from discrimination because of race or sex certainly knew we had a racial problem. We have gone a long way toward correcting these problems, but we still have a long way to go."}]}

I noticed also in The Wall Street Journal early this week, that a preliminary report of his task force advocates making Social Security more sound by reducing the adjustment in Social Security for the retired people to compensate for the impact of inflation. These kinds of approaches are very dangerous to the security, the well being and the peace of mind of the retired people of this country and those approaching retirement age. But no matter what it takes in the future to keep Social Security sound, it must be kept that way. And although there was a serious threat to the Social Security System and its integrity during the 1976 campaign and when I became President, the action of the Democratic Congress working with me has been to put Social Security back on a sound financial basis. That is the way it will stay."}]}

Im taking it from the historical viewpoint, if you go back to the 1600s when people came here, the reason they came to this country was to escape religious persecution, and thats the same reason why people are coming here today in the 1940s to escape Nazism, now in the 1980s and 1984 when they can get our of the country to escape communism so they can come here and practice their religion. Our country is founded on the principle that our government should be neutral as far as religion is concerned. Now whats happened over the past several years, and quite frankly Im not going to let you lay on me the intrusion of state politics into religion or religion into politics by my comments with reference to the presidents policies, because it started in 1980 when this administration was running for office and the Reverend Jerry Falwell became very, very involved in the campaign. What has happened over the past four years has been I think a real fudging of that line with the separation of church and state. The actions of the archbishops let me say to you I feel that they have not only a right but a responsibility to speak up, and even though Ive been the person that theyre speaking up about, l feel they do have the responsibility to do so, and I have no problem with it, no more than I did a priest who marched at the time of Vietnam and no more than I did at the time when Martin Luther King marched at the time of the civil rights marches. I have absolutely no problem with them speaking up, I think they have an obligation as well as a right. But what I do have a problem with is when the president of the United States gets up in Dallas and addresses a group of individuals and said to them that anybody who doesnt support his constitutional amendment for prayer in the schools is intolerant of religion. Now there are numerous groups who dont support that prayer in the school, numerous religious groups. Are they intolerant of religion? Is that what the president is saying? I also object, when I am told, that the Reverend Falwell has been told that he would pick two of our Supreme Court justices. Thats going a little bit far. In that instance, let me say to you it is more than a fudging at the line, it is a total intrusion, and I think that its in violation of our Constitution."}]}

What Ive had as a basic commitment since Ive been President is to reduce our dependence on foreign oil. It can only be done in two ways: one, to conserve energy  to stop the waste of energy  and, secondly, to produce more American energy. Weve been very successful in both cases. Weve now reduced the importing of foreign oil in the last year alone by one-third. We imported today 2 million barrels of oil less than we did the same date just a year ago. This commitment has been opening up a very bright vista for our nation in the future, because with the windfall profits tax as a base, we now have an opportunity to use American technology and American ability and American natural resources to expand rapidly the production of synthetic fuels, yes; to expand rapidly the production of solar energy, yes; and also to produce the traditional kinds of American energy. We will drill more oil and gas wells this year than any year in history. Well produce more coal this year than any year in history. We are exporting more coal this year than any year in history. And we have an opportunity now with improved transportation systems and improved loading facilities in our ports, to see a very good opportunity on a world international market, to replace OPEC oil with American coal as a basic energy source. This exciting future will not only give us more energy security, but will also open up vast opportunities for Americans to live a better life and to have millions of new jobs associated with this new and very dynamic industry now in prospect because of the new energy policy that weve put into effect."}]}

Our people feel that weve lost something precious. Thats not necessary. I wanna see our nation  return to a posture and an image and a standard to make us proud once again. I remember the world with NATO, and the world of Point Four, and the world of the Marshall Plan, and the world of the Peace Corps. Why cant we have that once again? We ought to be a beacon for nations who search for peace and who search for freedom, who search for individual liberty, who search for basic human rights. We havent been lately. We can be once again. Well never have that world leadership until we are strong at home, and we can have that strength if we return to the basic principles. It ought not to be a strength of bombast and threats.

I think I know the  the uh capabilities and limitations of atomic power. But the energy  uh policy of our nation is one that uh has not yet been established under this administration. I think almost every other developed nation in the world has an energy policy except us. We have seen uh  the Federal Energy Agency established, for instance. Uh  in the crisis of 1973 it was supposed to be a temporary agency, uh now its permanent, its enormous, its growing every day. I think the Wall Street Journal uh reported not too long ago they have a hundred and twelve public relations experts working for the Federal Energy Agency to try to justify to the American people its own existence. Weve got to have a  a firm way to handle the energy question. The reorganization proposal that I have put forward is one uh first step. In addition to that, we need to have  uh a realization that weve got uh about thirty-five years worth of oil left in the whole world. Were gonna run out of oil. When Mr. Nixon made his famous uh speech on Operation Independence we were importing about 35 percent of our oil. Now weve increased that amount 25 percent. We now import about 44 percent of our oil. We need to shift from oil to coal. We need to concentrate our research and development effort on uh coal burning and extraction, with safer mines, but also its clean burning. We need to shift very strongly toward solar energy and have strict conservation measures. And then as a last resort only, continue to use atomic power. I would certainly uh  not cut out atomic power altogether. We cant afford to give up that opportunity until later. But to the extent that we continue to use atomic power, I would be responsible as president to make sure that the safety precautions were initiated and maintained. For instance, some that have been forgotten; we need to have the reactor core  below ground level, the entire power plant that uses atomic uh  power tightly sealed and a heavy  heavy vacuum maintained. There ought to be a standardized design. There ought to be a full-time uh  atomic energy specialist, independent of the power company in the control room, full time, twenty-four hours a day, to shut down a plant if an abnormality develops. These kinds of uh  procedures, along with evacuation procedures, adequate insurance, ought to be initiated. So, shift from oil to coal, emphasize research and development on coal use and also on solar power, strict conservation measures, not yield every time that the special interest groups uh  put pressure on the president like uh this administration has done, and use atomic energy only as a last resort with the strictest possible safety precautions. Thats the best overall energy policy in the brief time we have to discuss it."}]}

I think your questions, however, underscore the fact there is probably no way that government should or could answer this question in every individual case and in the private lives of the American people. The constitutional amendment proposed by President Reagan would make it a crime for a woman to have an abortion if she had been raped or suffered from incest. Is it really the view of the American people, however you feel on the question of abortion, that government ought to be reaching into your livingrooms and making choices like this? I think it cannot work, wont work, and will lead to all kinds of cynical evasions of the law. Those who can afford to have them will continue to have them. The disadvantaged will go out in the back alley as they used to do. I think these questions are inherently personal and moral, and every individual instance is different. Every American should be aware of the seriousness of the step. But there are some things that government can do and some things they cannot do. Now, the example that the President cites has nothing to do with abortion. Somebody went to a woman and nearly killed her. Thats always been a serious crime and always should be a serious crime. But how does that compare with the problem of a woman who is raped? Do we really want those decisions made by judges whove been picked because they will agree to find the person guilty? I dont think so, and I think its going in exactly the wrong direction. In America, on basic moral questions we have always let the people decide in their own personal lives. We havent felt so insecure that weve reached for the club of state to have our point of view. Its been a good instinct. And were the most religious people on Earth. One final point: President Reagan, as Governor of California, signed a bill which is perhaps the most liberal proabortion bill of any State in the Union."}]}

Amnesty means that  that you uh  that what you did was right. Pardon means that what you did, whether its right or wrong, youre forgiven for it. And I do advocate a pardon for  for draft evaders.

It was at that time that President Reagan gave a speech welcoming them home  as America did, we were so excited to see them back. But what he said was: The United States has been embarrassed for the last time. Were going to stand tall and if this ever happens again, theres going to be swift and immediate steps taken to address the wrong that our country has founded  has suffered. In April of J983 I was in Beirut and visited the ambassador at the embassy. Two weeks later, that embassy was bombed. At that time  take a look at the crazy activities of terrorists, you cant blame that on anybody. Theyre going to do crazy things and you just dont know whats going to happen. The following October, there was another bombing and that bombing took place at the marine barracks, where there were 242 young men who were killed. Right after that bombing occurred, there was a commission set up called the Long Commission. That commission did a study of the security arrangements around where the marines were sleeping and found that there was negligence, that they did not have proper gates up, proper precautions to stop those trucks from coming in. And so the Long Commission issued a report, and President Reagan got up and he said: Im commander in chief. I take responsibility. And we all waited for something to be done when he look responsibility. Well, last month we had our third bombing, The first time, the first embassy, there was no gate up, The second time, with our Marines, the gate was open. The third time, the gate was there but it had not been installed. And what was the presidents reaction? Well, the security arrangements were not in, our people were placed in that embassy in an unsecured time, and the marines who were guarding it were left to go away and there were other people guarding the embassy. Again the president said: I assume responsibility. Id like to know what that means. Are we going to take proper precautions before we put Americans in situations where theyre in danger, or are we just going to walk away, throwing our arms in the air now  quite a reversal from the first time, from the first time when he said he was going to do something?

Id like to ask the American people what, whats been accomplished. A lot remains to be done. My own background is different from his. I was a school board member, and a library board member. I served an a hospital authority. And I was in the state senate and I was governor and Im an engineer, a Naval officer, a farmer, a businessman. And I believe we require someone who can work harmoniously with the Congress, who can work closely with the people of this country, and who can bring a new image and a new spirit to Washington. Our tax structure is a disgrace, it needs to be reformed. I was Governor of Georgia for four years. We never increased sales taxes or income tax or property tax. As a matter of fact, the year before I went out of office we gave a $50 million refund to the property taxpayers of Georgia. We spend six hundred dollars per person in this country  every man, woman and child  for health care. We still rank fifteenth among all the nations of the world in infant mortality. And our cancer rate is uh  higher than any country in the world. We dont have good health care. We could have it. Employment ought to be restored to our people. Weve become almost a welfare state. We spend now 700 percent more on unemployment compensation than we did eight years ago when the Republicans took over the White House. Our people wanna go back to work. Our education system can be improved. Secrecy ought to be stripped away from government and a maximum of personal privacy ought to be maintained. Our housing programs have uh  gone bad. It used to be that the average  uh family could own a house. But now less than a third of our people can afford to buy their own homes. The budget was more grossly out of balance last year than ever before in the history of our country  $65 billion  primarily because our people are not at work. Inflation is robbing us, as weve already discussed, and the government bureaucracy is uh  just a horrible mess. This doesnt have to be. Now I dont know all the answers. Nobody could. But I do know that if the president of the United States and the Congress of the United States and the people of the United States said, I believe our nation is greater than what we are now. I believe that if we are inspired, if we can achieve a degree of unity, if we can set our goals high enough and work toward recognized goals with industry and labor and agriculture along with government at all levels, then we can achieve great things. We might have to do it slowly. There are no magic answers to do it. But I believe together we can make great progress. We can correct our difficult mistakes and answer those very tough questions. I believe in the greatness of our country, and I believe the American people are ready for a change in Washington. Weve been drifting too long. Weve been dormant too long. Weve been discouraged too long. And we have not set an example for our own people. But I believe that we can now establish in the White House a good relationship with Congress, a good relationship with our people, set very high goals for our country. And with inspiration and hard work we can achieve great things. And let the world know  thats very important. But more importantly, let the people in our own country realize that we still live in the greatest nation on earth. Thank you very much."}]}

I just dont agree on the same direction he does on how to achieve it. But I dont find any problem with that. I think thats been something thats been handled by the courts, and not being handled by Congress and will not be handled by the White House. But we both support nondiscrimination in housing and integration of neighborhoods. The goals we both set forth. With reference to tuition tax credits, I have represented a district in Queens which is 70 percent Catholic. I represented my district. Let me say as well that I have also been a great supporter of public school education and that is something that Fritz and I feel very, very strongly about for the future of this country. And this administration over the past several years has gutted the educational programs available to our young people. It has attempted to knock out Pell Grants, which are monies to young individuals who are poor and who cannot afford to go to college. It has reduced by 25 percent the amount of monies going into college education and by a third those going into secondary and primary schools. But Fritz Mondale and I feel very strongly that if you educate your children that thats an effort and the way that you build up and make a stronger America. With reference to civil rights I think youve got to go beyond that and if you take a look, also, at my record in the Congress and Fritz Mondales record, both in the Senate and as vice president, we both have extremely strong civil rights records. This administration does not. It has come in in the Bob Jones on the side of segregated academies. It came in in the Grove City case on the side of discrimination against women, the handicapped, and the elderly. As a matter of fact, in the Congress we just passed overwhelmingly the Civil Rights Bill of 1984 and this administration, the Republican-controlled Senate, just killed it in the last week or two in Congress. So there is a real difference between how the Mondale-Ferraro administration will address the problems of civil rights and the failure of this administration specifically in that particular area."}]}

We uh  streamlined the structure of the court, put in administrative officers, put a unified court system in, required that all uh  severe sentences be reviewed far uniformity. And, in addition to that put forward a proposal that was adopted and used throughout my own term of office of selection of  for all judges and district attorneys or prosecuting attorneys, on the basis of merit. Every time I had a vacancy on the Georgia Supreme Court  and I filled five of those vacancies out of seven total and about half the court of appeals judges, about 35 percent of the trial judges  I was given from an objective panel the five most highly qualified persons in Georgia. And from those five, I always chose the first one or second one. So merit selection of judges is the most important single criterion. And I would institute the same kind of procedure as president, not only in judicial appointments, but also in diplomatic appointments. Secondly, I think that the Burger Court has fairly well confirmed the major and  and most far-reaching and most controversial decisions of the Warren Court. Civil rights  uh has been confirmed by the Burger Court, hasnt been uh  reversed, and I dont think theres any inclination to reverse those basic decisions. The one-man, one-vote rule, which is a very important one that uh  s- struck down the unwarranted influence in the legislature of parsley  uh populated areas of  of the states. The uh  right of indigent or very poor accused persons to uh  legal counsel. Uh  I think the Burger Court has confirmed that basic and very controversial decision of the Warren Court. Also the  the protection of an arrested person against unwarranted persecution in trying to get a false uh  confession. But now I think there have been a couple of instances where the Burger Court has made technical rulings where an obviously guilty person was later found to be guilty. And I think that in that case uh  some of the more liberal uh  members of the uh  so-called Warren Court agreed with those decisions. But the only uh  thing I uh  have pointed out was, what Ive just said, and that there was a need to clarify the technicalities so that you couldnt be forced to release a person who was obviously guilty just because of a  of a small technicality in the law.

I have no illusions about the Soviet Union leadership or the nature of that state. They are a tough and a ruthless adversary, and we must be prepared to meet that challenge, and I would. Where I part with the President is that despite all of those differences we must, as past Presidents before this one have done, meet on the common ground of survival. And thats where the President has opposed practically every arms control agreement, by every President, of both political parties, since the bomb went off. And he now completes this term with no progress toward arms control at all, but with a very dangerous arms race underway instead. There are now over 2,000 more warheads pointed at us today than there were when he was sworn in, and that does not strengthen us. We must be very, very realistic in the nature of that leadership, but we must grind away and talk to find ways of reducing these differences, particularly where arms races are concerned and other dangerous exercises of Soviet power. There will be no unilateral disarmament under my administration. I will keep this nation strong. I understand exactly what the Soviets are up to, but that, too, is a part of national strength. To do that, a President must know what is essential to command and to leadership and to strength. And thats where the Presidents failure to master, in my opinion, the essential elements of arms control has cost us dearly. Hes 3 years into this administration. He said he just discovered that most Soviet missiles are on land, and thats why his proposal didnt work. I invite the American people tomorrow  because I will issue the statement quoting President Reagan  he said exactly what I said he said. He said that these missiles were less dangerous than ballistic missiles because you could fire them, and you could recall them if you decided thered been a miscalculation."}]}

This evening we talked about national strength. I believe we need to be strong, and I will keep us strong. But I think strength must also require wisdom and smarts in its exercise. Thats key to the strength of our nation. A President must know the essential facts essential to command. But a President must also have a vision of where this nation should go. Tonight, as Americans, you have a choice. And youre entitled to know where we would take this country if you decide to elect us. As President, I would press for long-term, vigorous economic growth. Thats why I want to get these debts down and these interest rates down, restore Americas exports, help rural America, which is suffering so much, and bring the jobs back here for our children. I want this next generation to be the best educated in American history, to invest in the human mind and science again, so were out front. I want this nation to protect its air, its water, its land, and its public health. America is not temporary; were forever. And as Americans, our generation should protect this wonderful land for our children. I want a nation of fairness, where no one is denied the fullness of life or discriminated against, and we deal compassionately with those in our midst who are in trouble. And, above all, I want a nation thats strong. Since we debated 2 weeks ago, the United States and the Soviet Union have built a hundred more warheads, enough to kill millions of Americans and millions of Soviet citizens. This doesnt strengthen us. This weakens the chances of civilization to survive. I remember the night before I became Vice President. I was given the briefing and told that any time, night or day, I might be called upon to make the most fateful decision on Earth  whether to fire these atomic weapons that could destroy the human species. That lesson tells us two things: One, pick a President that you know will know if that tragic moment ever comes what he must know, because therell be no time for staffing committees or advisers. A President must know right then. But above all, pick a President who will fight to avoid the day when that God-awful decision ever needs to be made. And thats why this election is so terribly important. America and Americans decide not just whats happening in this country. We are the strongest and most powerful free society on Earth. When you make that judgment, you are deciding not only the future of our nation; in a very profound respect, youre deciding the future of the world. We need to move on. Its time for America to find new leadership. Please, join me in this cause to move confidently and with a sense of assurance and command to build the blessed future of our nation."}]}

Hes been in office two years, and there has been absolutely no progress made toward a new SALT agreement. He has learned the date of the expiration of SALT I, apparently. Weve seen, in this world, a development of a tremendous threat to us. As a nuclear engineer myself, I know the limitations and capabilities of atomic power. I also  know that as far as the human beings on this earth are concerned that the nonproliferation of atomic weapons is number one. Only the last few days with the election approaching, has Mr. Ford taken any interest in a nonproliferation movement. I advocated last May in a speech at the United Nations that we move immediately as a nation to declare a complete moratorium on the testing of all nuclear devices, both weapons and peaceful devices; that we not ship any more atomic fuel to a country that refuses to comply with strict controls over the waste which can be reprocessed into explosives. Ive also advocated that we stop the sale by Germany and France of  processing plants for Pakistan and Brazil. Mr. Ford hasnt moved on this. We also need to provide an adequate supply of enriched uranium. Mr. Ford, again, under pressure from the atomic energy lobby, has insisted that this reprocessing or rather re-en- enrichment be done by private industry and not by the existing uh  government uh  plants. This kind of confusion and absence of leadership has let us drift now for two years with a constantly increasing threat of atomic weapons throughout the world. We now have five nations that have atomic bombs that we know about. If we continue under Mr. Fords policy by 1985 or 90 well have twenty nations that have the capability of exploding atomic weapons. This has got to be stopped. That is one of the major challenges and major undertakings that I will assume as the next president."}]}

I have never advocated a Communist government for Italy. That would obviously be a ridiculous thing for anyone to do who wanted to be president of this country. I think that this is uh  an instance of uh  deliberate distortion, and this has occurred also in the question about defense. As a matter of fact, uh  Ive never advocated any cut of $15 billion in our defense budget. As a matter of fact, Mr. Ford has made a political football out of the defense budget. About a year ago he cut the Pentagon budget six point eight billion dollars. After he fired James Schlesinger, the political heat got so great that he added back about $3 billion. When Ronald Reagan won the Texas primary election, Mr. Ford added back another one and a half billion dollars. Immediately before the Kansas City convention, he added back another one point eight billion dollars in the defense budget. And his own uh  Office of Management and Budget testified that he had a $3 billion cut insurance added to the defense budget  defense budget under the pressure from the Pentagon. Obviously, this is another indication of trying to use the defense budget for political purposes, which hes trying to do tonight. Now, we went into south Africa late, after Great Britain, Rhodesia, the black nations had been trying to solve this problem for many, many years. We didnt go in until right before the election, similar to what was taking place in 1972, when Mr. Kissinger announced peace is at hand just before the election at that time. And we have weakened our position in NATO because the other countries in Europe supported the democ- democratic forces in Portugal long before we did; we stuck to the Portugal dictatorships much longer than other democracies did in this world."}]}

Six predecessors of mine who served in the Oval Office called for this guarantee of womens rights. Governor Reagan and his new Republican Party have departed from this commitment  a very severe blow to the opportunity for women to finally correct discrimination under which they have suffered. When a man and a women do the same amount of work, a man gets paid $1.00, a women only gets paid 59 cents. And the equal rights amendment only says that equality of rights shall not be abridged for omen b the Federal Government or by he state governments. That is all it says a simple guarantee of equality of opportunity which typifies the Democratic arty, and which is a very important commitment of mine, as contrasted with Governor Reagans radical departure from the long-standing policy of his own party."}]}

If I ever decided to impose an embargo because of a crisis in international relationships, it would include all shipments of all equipment. For instance, if the Arab countries ever again declare an embargo against our nation on oil I would consider that not a military but an economic declaration of war, and I would respond instantly and in kind. I would not ship that Arab country anything  no weapons, no spare parts for weapons, no oil-drilling rigs, no oil pipe, no nothing. I wouldnt single out just food. Another thing that Id like to say is this: In our international trade, as I said in my op- opening statement, we have become the arms merchant of the world. When this Republican administration came into office we were shipping about $1 billion worth of arms overseas, now ten to twelve billion dollars worth of arms overseas to countries that quite often use these weapons to fight each other. The shift in emphasis has been very disturbing to me, speaking about the Middle East. Under the last Democratic administration 60 percent of all weapons that went into the Middle East were for Israel. Nowadays  75 percent were for Israel before. Now 60 percent go to the Arab countries, and this does not include Iran. If you include Iran, our present shipment of weapons to the Middle East, only 20 percent goes to Israel. This is a deviation from idealism; its a deviation from a commitment to our major ally in the Middle East, which is Israel; its a yielding to economic pressure on the part of the Arabs on the oil issue; and its also a tremendous indication that under the Ford administration we have not addressed the energy policy adequately. We still have no comprehensive energy policy in this country. And its an overall sign of weakness. When we are weak at home economically  high unemployment, high inflation, a confused government, a wasteful defense establishment, this encourages the kind of pressure thats been put on us successfully. It wouldve been inconceivable ten  fifteen years ago, for us to be brought to our knees with an Arab oil embargo. But it was done three years ago and theyre still putting pressure on us from the Arab countries to our discredit around the world. These are the weaknesses that I see, and I believe its not just a matter of idealism. Its a matter of being tough. Its a matter of being strong. Its a matter of being consistent. Our priorities ought to be first of all to meet our own military needs, secondly to meet the needs of our allies and friends, and only then should we ship military equipment to foreign countries. As a matter of fact, Iran is gonna get eighty F-14s before we even meet our own Air Force orders for F-l4s. And the shipment of Spruance-class destroyers to Iran are much more highly sophisticated than the Spruance-class destroyers that are present being delivered to our own Navy. This is ridiculous and it ought to be changed."}]}

These commitments that the Democratic Party has historically made to the working families of this nation have been extremely important to the growth in their stature and in a better quality of life for them. I noticed recently that Governor Reagan frequently quotes Democratic presidents in his acceptance address. I have never heard a candidate for President, who is a Republican, quote a Republican president, but when they get in office, they try to govern like Republicans. So, it is good fo the American people to remember that there is a sharp basic historical difference between Governor Reagan and me on these crucial issues  also, between the two parties that we represent."}]}

The Soviet Union is still jamming Radio Free Europe  Radio  uh- uh  Radio Free Europe is being jammed. Weve also seen a very serious uh  problem with the so-called Sonnenfeldt document, which apparently Mr. Ford has just endorsed, which said that theres an organic linkage between the Eastern European countries and the Soviet Union. And I would like to see Mr. Ford convince the Polish-Americans and the Czech-Americans and the Hungarian-Americans in this country that those countries dont live under the domination and supervision of the Soviet Union behind the Iron  uh  Curtain. We also have seen Mr. Ford exclude himself from access to the public. He hasnt had a tough cross-examination-type press conference in over thirty days. One press conference he had without sound. Hes also shown a weakness in yielding to pressure. The Soviet Union, for instance, put pressure on Mr. Ford and he refused to see a symbol of human freedom recognized around the world, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn. The Arabs have put pressure on Mr. Ford, and hes yielded, and has permitted a boycott by the Arab countries of American businesses who trade with Israel, or who have American Jews owning or taking part in the management of American  companies. His own secretary of commerce had to be subpoenaed by the Congress to reveal the names of businesses who were subject to this boycott. They didnt volunteer the information. He had to be subpoenaed. And the last thing Id like to say is this: This grain deal with the Soviet Union in 72 was terrible, and Mr. Ford made up for it with three embargoes, one against our own ally in Japan. Thats not the way to run our foreign policy, including international trade."}]}

At one of the recent economic summit conferences between myself and the other leaders of the western world, we committed ourselves to take strong action against terrorism. Airplane hijacking was one of the elements of that commitment. There is no doubt that we have seen in recent years  in recent months  additional acts of violence against Jews in France and, of course, against those who live in Israel, by the PLO and other terrorist organizations. Ultimately, the most serious terrorist threat is if one of those radical nations, who believe in terrorism as a policy, should have atomic weapons. Both I and all my predecessors have had a deep commitment to controlling the proliferation of nuclear weapons. In countries like Libya or Iraq, we have even alienated some of our closest trade partners because we have insisted upon the control of the spread of nuclear weapons to those potentially terrorist countries. When Governor Reagan has been asked about that, he makes the very disturbing comment that non-proliferation, or the control of the spread of nuclear weapons, is none of our business. And recently when he was asked specifically about Iraq, he said there is nothing we can do about it. This ultimate terrorist threat is the most fearsome of all, and its part of a pattern where our country must stand firm to control terrorism of all kinds."}]}

Some of the things that can be done about this is a change in the rate structure of electric power companies. We uh  now encourage people to waste electricity, and uh  by giving uh  the lowest rates to the biggest users. We dont do anything to cut down on peak load requirements. We dont have an adequate requirement for the insulation of homes, for the efficiency of automobiles. And whenever the uh  automobile manufacturers come forward and say they cant meet the uh  amendments that the Congress has put forward, this Republican administration has delayed the implementation dates. In addition to that, we ought to have a  a shift toward the use of coal, particularly in the Appalachian regions where the coal is located.

Encouragement by the president for people to uh voluntarily conserve  yes. And also the private sector ought to be encouraged to  to bring forward to the public the benefits from efficiency. One bank in uh  Washington, fo- for instance, gives lower interest loans for people who adequately insulate their homes or who buy efficient automobiles.

I think its been a very constructive debate and I hope its helped to acquaint the American people with the sharp differences between myself and Governor Reagan. Also, I want to thank the people of Cleveland and Ohio for being such hospitable hosts during these last few hours in my life. Ive been President now for almost four years. Ive had to make thousands of decisions, and each one of those decisions has been a learning process. Ive seen the strength of my nation, and Ive seen the crises it approached in a tentative way. And Ive had to deal with those crises as best I could. As Ive studied the record between myself and Governor Reagan, Ive been impressed with the stark differences that exist between us. I think the result of this debate indicates that that fact is true. I consider myself in the mainstream of my party. I consider myself in the mainstream even of the bipartisan list of Presidents who served before me. The United States must be a nation strong; the United States must be a nation secure. We must have a society thats just and fair. And we must extend the benefits of our own commitment to peace, to create a peaceful world. I believe that since Ive been in office, there have been six or eight areas of combat evolved in other parts of the world. In each case, I alone have had to determine the interests of my country and the degree of involvement of my country. Ive done that with moderation, with care, with thoughtfulness; sometimes consulting experts. But, Ive learned in this last three and a half years that when an issue is extremely difficult, when the call is very close, the chances are the experts will be divided almost 50-50. And the final judgment about the future of the nation  war, peace, involvement, reticence, thoughtfulness, care, consideration, concern  has to be made by the man in the Oval Office. Its a lonely job, but with the involvement of the American people in the process, with an open Government, the job is a very gratifying one. The American people now are facing, next Tuesday, a lonely decision. Those listening to my voice will have to make a judgment about the future of this country. And I think they ought to remember that one vote can make a lot of difference. If one vote per precinct had changed in 1960, John Kennedy would never have been President of this nation. And if a few more people had gone to the polls and voted in 1968, Hubert Humphrey would have been President; Richard Nixon would not. There is a partnership involved in our nation. To stay strong, to stay at peace, to raise high the banner of human rights, to set an example for the rest of the world, to let our deep beliefs and commitments be felt by others in other nations, is my plan for the future. I ask the American people to join me in this partnership."}]}

And we can see that in both Lebanon and in Central America. In Lebanon, this President exercised American power, all right, but the management of it was such that our marines were killed, we had to leave in humiliation, the Soviet Union became stronger, terrorists became emboldened. And it was because they did not think through how power should be exercised, did not have the American public with them on a plan that worked, that we ended up the way we did. Similarly, in Central America: What were doing in Nicaragua with this covert war  which the Congress, including many Republicans, have tried to stop  is finally end up with a public definition of American power that hurts us, where we get associated with political assassins and the rest. We have to decline, for the first time in modern history, jurisdiction in the World Court because theyll find us guilty of illegal actions. And our enemies are strengthened from all of this. We need to be strong, we need to be prepared to use that strength, but we must understand that we are a democracy. We are a government by the people, and when we move, it should be for very severe and extreme reasons that serve our national interests and end up with a stronger country behind us.

And I support the air launch cruise missile, the ground launch cruise missile, the Pershing missile, the Trident submarine, the D  5 submarine, Stealth technology, the Midgetman  we have a whole range of technology. Why I disagree with the MX is that its a sitting duck. Itll draw an attack. It puts a hair-trigger, and it is a dangerous, destabilizing weapon. And the B  1 is similarly to be opposed, because for 15 years the Soviet Union has been preparing to meet the B  1. The Secretary of Defense himself said it would be a suicide mission if it were built. Instead, I want to build the Midgetman, which is mobile and thus less vulnerable, contributing to stability, and a weapon that will give us security and contribute to an incentive for arms control. Thats why Im for Stealth technology, to build a Stealth bomber  which Ive supported for years  that can penetrate the Soviet air defense system without any hope that they can perceive where it is because their radar system is frustrated. In other words, a President has to make choices. This makes us stronger. The final point is that we can use this money that we save on these weapons to spend on things that we really need. Our conventional strength in Europe is under strength. We need to strengthen that in order to assure our Western allies of our presence there, a strong defense, but also to diminish and reduce the likelihood of a commencement of a war and the use of nuclear weapons. Its in this way, by making wise choices, that were stronger, we enhance the chances of arms control. Every President until this one has been able to do it, and this nation  or the world is more dangerous as a result."}]}

There is no question that we face this massive deficit, and almost everybody agrees unless we get it down, the chances for long-term, healthy growth are nil. And its also unfair to dump these tremendous bills on our children. The President says it will disappear overnight because of some reason. No one else believes thats the case. I do, and Im standing up to the issue with an answer thats fair. I think thats what leadership is all about. Theres a difference between being a quarterback and a cheerleader, and when theres a real problem, a President must confront it. What I was referring to, of course, in the comment that you referred to was the situation in Lebanon. Now, for three occasions, one after another, our Embassies were assaulted in the same way by a truck with demolitions. The first time  and I did not criticize the President, because these things can happen  once, and sometimes twice  the second time the barracks in Lebanon were assaulted, as we all remember. There was two or three commission reports, recommendations by the CIA, the State Department, and the others, and the third time there was even a warning from the terrorists themselves. Now, I believe that a President must command that White House and those who work for him. Its the toughest job on Earth, and you must master the facts and insist that things that must be done are done. I believe that the way in which I will approach the Presidency is whats needed, because all my life that has been the way in which I have sought to lead. And thats why in this campaign Im telling you exactly what I want to do. I am answering your questions. I am trying to provide leadership now, before the election, so that the American people can participate in that decision."}]}

Mr. Fords own uh  environmental agency has projected a 10 percent unemployment rate by 1978 if hes uh  president. The American people are ready to make sacrifices if they are part of the process. If they know that they will be helping to make decisions and wont be excluded from being an involved party to the national purpose. The major effort we must put forward is to put our people back to work. And I think that this uh  is one example where uh  a lot of people have selfish, grasping ideas now. I remember 1973 in the depth of the uh  energy crisis when President Nixon called on the American people to make a sacrifice, to cut down on the waste of uh  gasoline, to cut down on the uh  speed of automobiles. It was a  a tremendous surge of patriotism, that I want to make a sacrifice for my country. I think we uh  could call together, with strong leadership in the White House, business, industry and labor, and say lets have voluntary price restraints. Lets lay down some guidelines so we dont have continuing inflation. We can also have a- an end to the extremes. We now have one extreme for instance, of some welfare recipients, who by taking advantage of the welfare laws, the housing laws, the uh  Medicaid uh  laws, and the uh  food stamp laws, make over $10 thousand a year and uh  they dont have to pay any taxes on it. At the other extreme, uh  just 1 percent of the richest people in our country derive 25 percent of all the tax benefits. So both those extremes grasp for advantage and the person who has to pay that expense is the middle-income family whos still working for a living and they have to pay for the rich who have privilege, and for the poor who are not working. But I think uh  uh  a balanced approach, with everybody being part of it and a striving for unselfishness, could help as it did in 1973 to let people sacrifice for their own country. I know Im ready for it. I think the American people are too."}]}

Its time for government, industry, labor, manufacturing, agriculture, education, other entities in our society to cooperate.

Its not the America that we have to have in the future. I dont claim to know all the answers. But Ive got confidence in my country. Our economic strength is still there. Our system of government  in spite of Vietnam, Cambodia, CIA, Watergate  is still the best system of government on earth. And the greatest resource of all are the two hundred and fifteen million Americans who have within us the strength, the character, the intelligence, the experience, the patriotism, the idealism, the compassion, the sense of brotherhood on which we can rely in the future to restore the greatness to our country We ought not to be excluded from our government anymore. We need a president who can go in  who derives his strength from the people. I owe the special interests nothing. I owe everything to you, the people of this country. And I believe that we can bind our wounds. I believe that we can work together.

And perhaps the dominant domestic issue of our times is what do we do about these enormous deficits. I respect the President; I respect the Presidency, and I think he knows that. But the fact of it is, every estimate by this administration about the size of the deficit has been off by billions and billions of dollars. As a matter of fact, over 4 years, theyve missed the mark by nearly $600 billion. We were told we would have a balanced budget in 1983. It was $200 billion deficit instead. And now we have a major question facing the American people as to whether well deal with this deficit and get it down for the sake of a healthy recovery. Virtually every economic analysis that Ive heard of, including the distinguished Congressional Budget Office, which is respected by, I think, almost everyone, says that even with historically high levels of economic growth, we will suffer a $263 billion deficit. In other words, it doesnt converge as the President suggests. It gets larger even with growth. What that means is that we will continue to have devastating problems with foreign trade. This is the worst trade year in American history by far. Our rural and farm friends will have continued devastation. Real interest rates  the real cost of interest  will remain very, very high, and many economists are predicting that were moving into a period of very slow growth because the economy is tapering off and may be a recession. I get it down to a level below 2 percent of gross national product with a policy thats fair.

A minute ago the President quoted Cicero, I believe. I want to quote somebody a little closer to home, Harry Truman. He said, The buck stops here. We just heard the Presidents answer for the problems at the barracks in Lebanon, where 241 marines were killed. What happened? First, the Joint Chiefs of Staff went to the President, said, Dont put those troops there. They did it. And then 5 days before the troops were killed, they went back to the President, through the Secretary of Defense, and said, Please, Mr. President, take those troops out of there because we cant defend them. They didnt do it. And we know what happened. After that, once again, our Embassy was exploded. This is the fourth time this has happened  an identical attack, in the same region, despite warnings  even public warnings  from the terrorists. Whos in charge? Whos handling this matter? Thats my main point. Now, on arms control, were completing 4 years. This is the first administration since the bomb went off that made no progress. We have an arms race underway instead. A President has to lead his government or it wont be done. Different people with different views fight with each other. For 3\\1/2\\ years, this administration avoided arms control, resisted tabling arms control proposals that had any hope of agreeing, rebuked their negotiator in 1981 when he came close to an agreement, at least in principle, on medium-range weapons. And we have this arms race underway. And a recent book that just came out by perhaps the Nations most respected author in this field, Strobe Talbott, called Deadly Gambits, concludes that this President has failed to master the essential details needed to command and lead us, both in terms of security and terms of arms control. Thats why they call the President the Commander in Chief. Good intentions, I grant. But it takes more than that. You must be tough and smart."}]}
