0,Ferraro,"Well, let me first say that I wasnt born at the age of forty-three when I entered Congress. I did have a life before that as well. I was a prosecutor for almost five years in the district attorneys office in Queens County and I was a teacher. Theres not only what is on your paper resume that makes you qualified to run for or to hold office. Its how you approach problems and what your values are. I think if one is taking a look at my career theyll see that I level with the people; that I approach problems analytically; that I am able to assess the various facts with reference to a problem, and I can make the hard decisions. Im intrigued when I hear Vice-President Bush talk about his support of the presidents economic program and how everything is just going so beautifully. I, too, recall when Vice President Bush was running in the primary against President Reagan and he called the program voodoo economics, and it was and it is. We are facing absolutely massive deficits; this administration has chosen to ignore it; the president has failed to put forth a plan to deal with those deficits and if everything believes that everything is corning up roses, perhaps the vice-president should join me as I travel around the country and speak to people. People in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, are not terribly thrilled with whats happening in the economy because theyre standing in the light of a closed plant because theyve lost their jobs. The people in Youngstown, Ohio, have stores that are boarded up because the economy is not doing well. Its not only the old industries that are failing, its also the new ones. In San Jose, California, theyre complaining because they cant export their high-tech qualities  goods  to Japan and other countries. The people in the Northwest  in the state of Washington and Oregon  are complaining about whats happening to the timber industry and to the agriculture industry. So, so things are not as great as the administration is wanting us to believe in their television commercials. My feeling, quite frankly, is that I have enough experience to see the problems, address them and make the tough decisions and level with people with reference to those problems.",1984-10-11,Democrat,383,"What experiences do you believe best qualify you to address the economic challenges facing Americans today, and how would you contrast your approach with the current administration's policies?"
1,Ferraro,"I dont. Let me say that Im not a believer in polls and let me say further that what we are talking about are problems that are facing the entire nation. Theyre not just problems facing women. The issues in this campaign are the war-peace issues; the problems of deficits; the problems of trade deficits. We are now facing a $120 billion trade deficit in this country. Were facing problems of the environment. I think what were going to be doing over the next several weeks  and Im absolutely delighted that the League is sponsoring these debates and that we are, we are able to now speak to the American public and address the issues in a way such as this. I think youre going to see a change in those polls.",1984-10-11,Democrat,132,"What is your perspective on the significance of polling in relation to the broader issues facing our nation, and how do you see those issues impacting your campaign?"
2,Ferraro,"I, I think what Im going to have to do is Im going to start correcting the vice-presidents statistics. There are 6 million more people who have jobs and thats supposed to happen in a growing economy. In fact in the prior administration, with all their problems, they created 10 million jobs. The housing interest rates during this administration, for housing for middle-class Americans, was 14.5 percent. Under the prior administration, with all their problems, the average rate was 10.6 percent. If you take a look at the number of people living in poverty as a result of this administration, 6 million people, 500,000 people knocked off disability rolls. You know, its, you can walk around saying things are great and thats what were going to be hearing, weve been hearing that on those commercials for the past couple of months. I expect they expect the American people to believe that. Ill become a one-woman truth squad and well start tonight.",1984-10-11,Democrat,161,"What specific economic statistics or policies do you believe the current administration is misrepresenting, and how would you address these concerns if elected?"
3,Ferraro,"With reference to the busing vote that I cast in 1979, both Fritz Mondale and I agree on the same goal and that is nondiscrimination. I just dont agree on the same direction he does on how to achieve it. But I dont find any problem with that. I think thats been something thats been handled by the courts, and not being handled by Congress and will not be handled by the White House. But we both support nondiscrimination in housing and integration of neighborhoods. The goals we both set forth. With reference to tuition tax credits, I have represented a district in Queens which is 70 percent Catholic. I represented my district. Let me say as well that I have also been a great supporter of public school education and that is something that Fritz and I feel very, very strongly about for the future of this country. And this administration over the past several years has gutted the educational programs available to our young people. It has attempted to knock out Pell Grants, which are monies to young individuals who are poor and who cannot afford to go to college. It has reduced by 25 percent the amount of monies going into college education and by a third those going into secondary and primary schools. But Fritz Mondale and I feel very strongly that if you educate your children that thats an effort and the way that you build up and make a stronger America. With reference to civil rights I think youve got to go beyond that and if you take a look, also, at my record in the Congress and Fritz Mondales record, both in the Senate and as vice president, we both have extremely strong civil rights records. This administration does not. It has come in in the Bob Jones on the side of segregated academies. It came in in the Grove City case on the side of discrimination against women, the handicapped, and the elderly. As a matter of fact, in the Congress we just passed overwhelmingly the Civil Rights Bill of 1984 and this administration, the Republican-controlled Senate, just killed it in the last week or two in Congress. So there is a real difference between how the Mondale-Ferraro administration will address the problems of civil rights and the failure of this administration specifically in that particular area.",1984-10-11,Democrat,395,"What are your views on the role of federal government versus state courts in achieving nondiscrimination and civil rights, especially in relation to education and housing policies?"
4,Ferraro,"I do not support the use of quotas. Both Mr. Mondale and I feel very strongly about affirmative action to correct inequities, and we believe that steps should be taken both through government  for instance, the Small Business Administration. We have supported set-asides for minority and womens businesses. Thats a positive thing. We dont feel that youre in any way hurting anybody else by reaching out with affirmative action to help those whove been disenfranchised. On the contrary, if you have a growing economy, if you create the jobs, if you allow for small business the opportunity with lower interest rates to reach out and grow, there will be more than enough space for everybody. And affirmative action is a very positive way to deal with the problems of discrimination.",1984-10-11,Democrat,130,"What is your stance on affirmative action, and how do you believe it impacts economic opportunities for marginalized communities without disadvantaging others?"
5,Ferraro,"The vice-president indicates that the President signed the Voting Rights Act. That was after he was  he did not support it while it was in the Congress, in the Senate, it was passed despite his opposition, and he did sign it because he was required to do so. In the civil rights cases that he mentioned, the great number of cases that they have enforced, the reason they enforced them because under the law theyre required to do that. And Im delighted that the administration is following the law. With reference",1984-10-11,Democrat,91,"What is your assessment of the President's support for the Voting Rights Act, specifically regarding his actions during its passage in Congress and his eventual decision to sign it?"
6,Ferraro,"I just have to correct in my thirty seconds that are left the comment that the vice-president made with reference specifically to a program like AFDC. If you take AFDC, if you take food stamps, if you take  oh, go down the line on poor peoples programs, those are the programs that suffered considerably under this administrations first budget cuts and those are the ones that in the second part of their part of their term, we were able to restore some of those terribly, terribly unfair cuts to the poor people of this country.",1984-10-11,Democrat,95,What is your response to the vice-president's remarks about social welfare programs and their impact on low-income families in our country?
7,Ferraro,"Let me say first of all I believe very, very sincerely in the separation of church and state. Im taking it from the historical viewpoint, if you go back to the 1600s when people came here, the reason they came to this country was to escape religious persecution, and thats the same reason why people are coming here today in the 1940s to escape Nazism, now in the 1980s and 1984 when they can get our of the country to escape communism so they can come here and practice their religion. Our country is founded on the principle that our government should be neutral as far as religion is concerned. Now whats happened over the past several years, and quite frankly Im not going to let you lay on me the intrusion of state politics into religion or religion into politics by my comments with reference to the presidents policies, because it started in 1980 when this administration was running for office and the Reverend Jerry Falwell became very, very involved in the campaign. What has happened over the past four years has been I think a real fudging of that line with the separation of church and state. The actions of the archbishops let me say to you I feel that they have not only a right but a responsibility to speak up, and even though Ive been the person that theyre speaking up about, l feel they do have the responsibility to do so, and I have no problem with it, no more than I did a priest who marched at the time of Vietnam and no more than I did at the time when Martin Luther King marched at the time of the civil rights marches. I have absolutely no problem with them speaking up, I think they have an obligation as well as a right. But what I do have a problem with is when the president of the United States gets up in Dallas and addresses a group of individuals and said to them that anybody who doesnt support his constitutional amendment for prayer in the schools is intolerant of religion. Now there are numerous groups who dont support that prayer in the school, numerous religious groups. Are they intolerant of religion? Is that what the president is saying? I also object, when I am told, that the Reverend Falwell has been told that he would pick two of our Supreme Court justices. Thats going a little bit far. In that instance, let me say to you it is more than a fudging at the line, it is a total intrusion, and I think that its in violation of our Constitution.",1984-10-11,Democrat,446,"How do you view the relationship between religion and politics in the context of our Constitution, and what concerns do you have about recent developments in that area?"
8,Ferraro,"Let me tell you that I did not come to my position on abortion very lightly. I am a devout Catholic. When I was running for Congress 1978 I sat and met with a person I felt very close to, a monsignor currently a bishop. I spoke to him about my personal feelings that I would never have an abortion, but I was not quite sure if I were ever to become pregnant as result of a rape if I would be that self-righteous. I then spoke to him; he said, Gerry, thats not good enough. There you cant support that position. I said okay. Thats my religious view; I will accept the teaching of the church, but I cannot impose my religious views on someone else. I truly take an oath as a public official to represent all the people in my district, not only the Catholics. If there comes a time where I cannot practice my religion and do my job properly, I will resign my job.",1984-10-11,Democrat,169,"What personal experiences or beliefs have shaped your position on the issue of abortion, and how do you reconcile your religious values with your responsibility to represent a diverse constituency?"
9,Ferraro,"Yes, I still find it very difficult to believe because in the platform, which this Republican party passed in Dallas  one of the things they was they said that this position on abortion would be a litmus test, not only for Supreme Court justices but for other federal justices. That, again, seems to me a blurring of the line of the separation between church and state.",1984-10-11,Democrat,66,"What are your thoughts on the impact of political party platforms, particularly regarding social issues like abortion, on the appointment of federal judges?"
10,Ferraro,"Let me say to you that I already did that. I wanted them to move ahead. If you recall, I spent about an hour and 45 minutes speaking to 200 reporters on August 21, which is the day after I was required to file my financial statement, and I sat for as long as they had questions on the issue, and I believe that they were satisfied. I filed more information than any other candidate for a national office in the history of this country. Not only did I agree to file my tax returns, after a little bit of prodding my husband also agreed to file his with the  not only the ethics committee but the FEC. Bur the action that youre speaking about with the ethics committee was started by a right-wing legal organization  foundation  knowing that I would have to  that there would be an automatic inquiry. We have filed the necessary papers, I have asked them to move along. Unfortunately, the House, I believe, went out of session today, so I dont know if they will move. But quite frankly, I would like that to be taken care of anyway, because I just want it cleared up.",1984-10-11,Democrat,201,"How do you respond to concerns about your financial disclosures and the ongoing inquiries related to your ethics, and what steps have you taken to ensure transparency?"
11,Ferraro,"Well, what it showed was that  and it was truly that I hired an accountant who had been with our family for well over forty years. He was filling our those ethics forms. I did not spend the time with him  I just gave him my tax information and he did it. I have to tell you what we have done since I have hired a marvelous accountant. Ive spent a lot of money having him go through all those ethics forms and he will be doing my taxes over the next eight years while were in the White House so that the American public can be sure its all been taken care of.",1984-10-11,Democrat,114,How will you ensure transparency and ethical responsibility in your financial dealings while in office?
12,Ferraro,"Let me just say that Id be happy to give the vice-president the name of my accountant, but I warn you, hes expensive. I think the question is whether or not the tax cuts and the tax system thats currently in our government, that our government uses, is fair; I think the tax system is unfair. But its not something that we can address in the short term. The tax cuts that Vice-President Bush and I got last, three years ago, that this president gave out, no, thats not fair. If you earn $200,000 a year, you got a $25,000 tax cut. If you earned between $20,000 and $40,000, you may have gotten about $1,000 between ten and twenty, close to a hundred dollars and if you made less than $10,000 with all the budget cuts that came down the line, you suffered a loss of $400. Thats not fair. Thats basically unfair and not only is it unfair, but economically it has darn near destroyed this country. Theres a $750 billion tax cut over a five-year period of time. Thats one of the reasons were facing these enormous deficits that we have today.",1984-10-11,Democrat,194,What is your assessment of the fairness of the current tax system and its impact on different income brackets in our country?
13,Ferraro,"Let me first say that terrorism is a global problem, and let me say secondly that the  Mr. Bush has referred to the embassy that was held in Iran, Well, I was at the White House in January, I guess it was, in 81, when those hostages, all fifty-two of them, came home alive. It was at that time that President Reagan gave a speech welcoming them home  as America did, we were so excited to see them back. But what he said was: The United States has been embarrassed for the last time. Were going to stand tall and if this ever happens again, theres going to be swift and immediate steps taken to address the wrong that our country has founded  has suffered. In April of J983 I was in Beirut and visited the ambassador at the embassy. Two weeks later, that embassy was bombed. At that time  take a look at the crazy activities of terrorists, you cant blame that on anybody. Theyre going to do crazy things and you just dont know whats going to happen. The following October, there was another bombing and that bombing took place at the marine barracks, where there were 242 young men who were killed. Right after that bombing occurred, there was a commission set up called the Long Commission. That commission did a study of the security arrangements around where the marines were sleeping and found that there was negligence, that they did not have proper gates up, proper precautions to stop those trucks from coming in. And so the Long Commission issued a report, and President Reagan got up and he said: Im commander in chief. I take responsibility. And we all waited for something to be done when he look responsibility. Well, last month we had our third bombing, The first time, the first embassy, there was no gate up, The second time, with our Marines, the gate was open. The third time, the gate was there but it had not been installed. And what was the presidents reaction? Well, the security arrangements were not in, our people were placed in that embassy in an unsecured time, and the marines who were guarding it were left to go away and there were other people guarding the embassy. Again the president said: I assume responsibility. Id like to know what that means. Are we going to take proper precautions before we put Americans in situations where theyre in danger, or are we just going to walk away, throwing our arms in the air now  quite a reversal from the first time, from the first time when he said he was going to do something? Or is this President going to take some action?",1984-10-11,Democrat,455,What specific actions do you believe the current administration should take to enhance the security of American embassies and protect our personnel abroad in light of past incidents of terrorism?
14,Ferraro,"I think they have a legitimate role in gathering information. And what has happened was the CIA, in the last bombing, had given information to our administration with reference to the actual threats that that embassy was going to be bombed. So it wasnt the CIA that was at fault. Theres legitimate reason for the CIA to be in existence, and thats to gather intelligence information for our security. But when I see the CIA doing things like theyre doing down in Central America  supporting a covert war  no, I dont support that kind of activity. The CIA is there, its meant to protect our government; not there to subvert other governments.",1984-10-11,Democrat,112,"What is your stance on the role of the CIA in national security, particularly in light of its intelligence-gathering responsibilities versus its involvement in covert operations abroad?"
15,Ferraro,"Let me just say, first of all, that I almost resent, Vice President Bush, your patronizing attitude that you have to teach me about foreign policy. Ive been a member of Congress for six years; I was there when the embassy was held hostage in Iran, and I have been there and Ive seen what has happened in the past several months; seventeen months of your administration. Secondly, please dont categorize my answers, either. Leave the interpretation of my answers to the American people who are watching this debate. And let me say further that no one has ever said that those young men who were killed through the negligence of this administration and others ever died in shame. No one who has a child who is nineteen or twenty years old, a son, would ever say that at the loss of anybody elses child.",1984-10-11,Democrat,145,"Vice President Bush, can you address your experience in foreign policy and how it shapes your perspective on the recent challenges our country has faced, particularly in light of your administration's decisions?"
16,Ferraro,"I would advocate the use of force when it was necessary to protect the security of our country, protect our security interest or protect our people or protect the interests of our friends and neighbors. When president  Im jumping the gun a bit, arent I?  when Mr. Mondale, Mr. Mondale referred to the quarantine of Central America, a country in Central America, what he is referring to is a last resort after all other means of attempting to settle the situation down in that region of the world had been exhausted. Quite frankly now what is being done by this administration is an Americanizing of a regional conflict. Theyre moving in militarily instead of promoting the Contadora process, which, as you know, is the process that is in place with the support of Mexico and Colombia and Panama and Venezuela. Instead of supporting the process, our administration has in Nicaragua been supporting covert activities to keep that revolution going in order to overthrow the Sandinista government; in El Salvador was not pushing the head of the government to move toward correction of the civil rights; human rights problems that existed there, and now this administration seems almost befuddled by the fact that Nicaragua is moving to participate in the Contadora process, and El Salvador is, through its President Duarte, is reaching out to the guerrillas in order to negotiate a peace. What Fritz Mondale and I feel about the situation down there is that what you do is you deal first through negotiation. That force is not a first resort but certainly a last resort in any instance.",1984-10-11,Democrat,268,How do you view the balance between military intervention and diplomatic efforts in addressing conflicts in Central America?
17,Ferraro,"No, I think what you have to do is work with the government  I assume youre speaking about the government of Nicaragua  work with that government to achieve a pluralistic society. I mean they do have elections that are coming up on November 4. I think we have to work with them to achieve a peaceful solution to bring about a pluralistic country. No, Im not willing to live with a force that could be a danger to our country. Certainly, I would see that our country would be there putting all kinds of pressure on the neighboring countries of Honduras, of Costa Rica, of El Salvador, to promote the kind of society that we can all live with and security in this country.",1984-10-11,Democrat,124,"What role do you believe the United States should play in promoting political stability and democracy in Nicaragua, especially with the upcoming elections?"
18,Ferraro,"I spent time in Central America in January and had an opportunity to speak to the contras after the incident in Nicaragua and in El Salvador. Let me just say that the situation as it exists now, because of this administrations policies, are not getting better. Were not moving toward a more secure area of the world. As a matter of fact the number of troops that the Sandinistas have accumulated since the administration started its covert activities has risen from 12,000 to 50,000, and of course the number of Soviet and Cuban advisors has also increased. I did not support the mining of the harbors in Nicaragua; it is a violation of international law. Congress did not support it and as a matter of fact, just this week, the Congress voted in cut off covert aid to Nicaragua unless and until a request is made and there is evidence of need for it, and the Congress approves it again in March. So if Congress doesnt get laid on, the covert activities which I opposed in Nicaragua, those CIA covert activities in that specific country, are not supported by the Congress. And believe it or not, not supported by the majority of people throughout the country.",1984-10-11,Democrat,206,"What are your thoughts on the current U.S. intervention strategies in Central America, particularly in relation to Nicaragua and the actions of the Sandinistas?"
19,Ferraro,"Let me say first of all that I dont think there is any issue that is more important in this campaign, in this election, than the issue of war and peace. And since today is Eleanor Roosevelts 100th birthday, let me quote her. She said, It is not enough to want peace, you must believe in it. And it is not enough to believe in it, you must work for it. This administrations policies have indicated quite the opposite. The last time I heard Vice President Bush blame the fact that they didnt meet with the Soviet leader, and this is the first president in forty years not to meet with a Soviet counterpart. He said the reason was because there are three Soviet leaders in the past three and a half years. I went and got a computer printout. Its five pages of the leaders, world leaders, that the Soviet leaders have met with, and theyre not little people. Theyre people like Mitterrand of France and Kohl of Germany and President Kiprianou of Cyprus  you go down the list, five pages of people that the Soviet leaders have managed to meet with and somehow they couldnt meet with the president of the United States. In addition to not meeting with his Soviet counterpart, this is the first president  and youre right  since the start of negotiating arms control agreements who have not negotiated an arms control agreement, But not only has he not negotiated one, hes been opposed to every single one that every other president has negotiated, including Eisenhower, including Ford, and including Nixon. Now, let me just say that with reference to the vice-presidents comments about the intent and the desire of the United Sites and this administration, the Soviet Union did walk out of the talks. I agree. But it seems to me in 1982, when the administration presented its Start proposal, that it wasnt a realistic proposal. And that is the comment that was made by Secretary Haig after he left office, because what it dealt with was that it dealt just with land-based nuclear missiles, which is where the Soviets had the bulk of their missiles. But that aside, in 1982, I believe it was, their own negotiator, Nitze, came out with a proposal called the walk-in-the-woods proposal which would have limited the number of nuclear arms in Europe. That proposal was turned down by the administration  a proposal presented by its own administrator. Now Im delighted that they met with Mr. Gromyko, but they could have had that opportunity to meet with him in 1981 when he came to the UN, which he had done with every other president before, and in 1982 as well. I guess my",1984-10-11,Democrat,455,"What do you consider to be the most pressing issue in foreign policy today, and how do you assess the current administration's approach to fostering peace and managing relationships with global leaders, particularly in relation to the Soviet Union?"
20,Ferraro,"I  You robbed me of my follow-up, thats what you robbed me, so why dont I let her give me the follow-up.",1984-10-11,Democrat,22,"Candidate, can you discuss how you believe the format of this debate impacts the ability to address important issues effectively?"
21,Ferraro,"I think first of all, you have to take a look at the current situation. We now have 50,000 nuclear warheads; we are building at the rate of five or six a day between us and we have been doing that since this administration came into office. I think what you can do is look at what theyve done and recognize that theyre not going to do very much in the future. And so, since theyve done nothing, do we continue to build because an arms race doesnt lead to anything, it leads to another arms race and thats that. Vice President Monad has indicated that what he would do, first of all, as soon as he. gets into office, is contact his Soviet counterpart and set up an annual summit meeting. Thats number one. I dont think you can start negotiating until you start talking. Secondly, he would issue a challenge, and the challenge would be in the nature of temporary, mutual, verifiable, moratoria to halt testing in the air, in the atmosphere, that would respond with a challenge from the Soviet Union, we hope, to sit down and negotiate a treaty. That was done in 1960. I dont know what your lights are doing, Sander.",1984-10-11,Democrat,207,"What are your thoughts on the current state of nuclear arms, and how do you propose to address the ongoing arms race?"
22,Ferraro,"Okay. Im watching them blinking. So I have another minute. What that would do is it would give us the opportunity to sit down and negotiate a treaty. That was done in 1960 by President Kennedy  in 1963. What he did was he issued a challenge to the Soviet Union. He said we will not test in space  in the atmosphere, if you will not. They did not. In two months they sat down and they negotiated a treaty. We do not now have to worry about that type of testing. It can be done; it will be done, if only you have the will to do it. Again, remember it is mutual; it is verifiable and it is a challenge that once that challenge is not met, if testing were to resume, then we would continue testing as well.",1984-10-11,Democrat,140,What specific actions do you believe the United States should take to reinvigorate international arms control negotiations and prevent further nuclear testing?
23,Ferraro,Are you saying that I would have to have fought in the war in order to love peace?,1984-10-11,Democrat,18,What are your thoughts on the relationship between military service and the understanding of peace?
24,Ferraro,"All right. I think what happens is when you try to equate whether or not I have had military experience, thats the natural conclusion. Its about as valid as saying that you would have to be black in order to despise racism, that youd have to be female in order to be terribly offended by sexism. And thats just not so. I think if you take a look at where Ive been, both in the Congress and where I intend to go, the type of person I am  I think that the people of this country can rely upon the fact that I will be a lender. I dont think the Soviet Union for one minute can sit down and make determination on what I will do if Im ever in a position to have to do something with reference to the Soviet Union. Quite frankly Im prepared to do whatever is necessary in order to secure this country and make sure that security is maintained. Secondly, if the Soviet Union were to ever believe that they could challenge the United States with any sort of nuclear forces or otherwise, if I were in a position of leadership in this country, they would be assured that they would be met with swift, concise and certain retaliation. Let me just say one other thing now. The most important thing, though I think as a leader that what one has to do is get to the point where youre not put into that position. And the way you to that position of rnoving away from having to make a decision  armed force or anything else  is by moving toward arms control. And thats not whats been done over the past four years. I think that if you were to take a look at the failures of this administration that would have to be number one. I will not put myself in that position as a leader in this country. I will move immediately toward arms control negotiations.",1984-10-11,Democrat,335,"How do you respond to criticisms suggesting that without military experience, you may lack the necessary perspective to handle national security and foreign policy challenges?"
25,Ferraro,"Oh, I dont have a single-most question. I guess the concern that I have is a concern not only as a vice-presidential candidate but as a citizen in this country. My concern is that we are not doing anything to stop the arms race, and if seems to me that if we keep talking about military inferiority  which we do not have, we are at a comparable level with the Soviet Union; our Joint Chiefs of Staff have said theyd never exchange our military power for theirs. I guess the thing that Id want is a commitment that pretty soon theyre going to do something about making this a safer world for all of us.",1984-10-11,Democrat,115,"What are your views on the current state of the arms race, and what specific steps do you believe should be taken to address military concerns and enhance global security?"
26,Ferraro,"I think the vice-presidents comment about the Carter-Mondale administration really typifies this administration. Its an administration that looks backwards, not forwards and into the future. I must say that Im also tickled by their comments on human rights. The Soviet Union in 1979 allowed 51,000 people to emigrate, because, in large measure, this administrations policies over the past four years, 1,313 people got out of the Soviet Union in 1983 and 1984. Thats not a great record on human rights and certainly not a record on human rights achievements. This administration spent a trillion dollars on defense, but it hasnt gotten a trillion dollars on national security.",1984-10-11,Democrat,107,"How do you respond to criticisms that your administration's approach to foreign policy, particularly regarding human rights and its focus on defense spending, is out of touch with the needs of the present and future?"
27,Ferraro,"I hope somebody wants to applaud. Being the candidate for vice-president of my party is the greatest honor I have ever had. But its not only a personal achievement for Geraldine Ferraro  and certainly not only the bond that I feel as I go across this country with women throughout the country. I wouldnt be standing here if Fritz Mondale didnt have the courage and my party didnt stand for the values that it does  the values of fairness and equal opportunity. Those values make our country strong and the future of this country and how strong it will be is what this election is all about. Over the last two months Ive been traveling all over the country talking to the people about the future. I was in Kentucky and I spoke to the Dyhouse family. He works for a car dealer and hes worried about the deficits and how high interest rates are going to affect his job. Every place I go I see young parents with their children and they say to me what are we going to do to stop this nuclear arms race. I was in Dayton, Ohio, a week and a half ago and I sat with the Allen family who live next door to a toxic dump and theyre very, very concerned about the fact that those toxics are seeping into the water that they and their neighbors drink. Now those people love this country and theyre patriotic. But its not the patriotism that youre seeing in the commercials as you watch television these days. Their patriotism is not only a pride in the country as it is, but a pride in this country that is strong enough to meet the challenges of the future. Do you know when we find jobs for the eight and a half million people who are unemployed in this country, you know well make our economy stronger and that will be a patriotic act. When we reduce the deficits and we cut interest rates, and I know the president doesnt believe that, but its so  we cut those interest rates young people can buy houses, thats pro-family and that will be a patriotic act. When we educate our children  good Lord, theyre going to be able to compete in a world economy and that makes us stronger and thats a patriotic act. When we stop the arms race, we make this a safer, saner world, and thats a patriotic act, and when we keep the peace young men dont die, and thats a patriotic act. Those are the keys to the future and who can be the leader for the future? When Walter Mondale was attorney general of Minnesota, he led the fight for a man who could not afford to get justice because he couldnt afford a lawyer; when he was in the Senate he fought for child nutrition programs, he wrote the Fair Housing Act, he even investigated the concerns and the abuses of migrant workers. And why did he do that? Those werent popular causes. You know, no one had ever heard of Clarence Gideon, the man without a lawyer. Children dont vote and migrant workers exactly a powerful lobby in this country, but he did it because it was right. Fritz Mondale has said that he would rather lose a battle for decency than win one over self-interest. Now I agree with him. This campaign is not over. For our country, for our future, for the principles we believe in Walter Mondale and I have just begun to fight.",1984-10-11,Democrat,596,"What do you believe are the most pressing issues facing American families today, and how do your beliefs about patriotism and leadership inform your approach to addressing them?"
28,Mr. Carter,"Mr. Stone, Ive had to make thousands of decisions since Ive been President, serving in the Oval Office. And with each one of those decisions that affect the future of my country, I have learned in the process. I think Im a much wiser and more experienced man than I was when I debated four years ago against President Ford. Ive also learned that there are no simple answers to complicated questions. H. L. Mencken said that for every problem theres a simple answer. It would be neat and plausible and wrong. The fact is that this nation, in the eight years before I became President, had its own military strength decreased. Seven out of eight years, the budget commitments for defense went down, 37% in all. Since Ive been in office, weve had a steady, carefully planned, methodical but, very effective increase in our commitment for defense. But what weve done is use that enormous power and prestige and military strength of the United States to preserve the peace. Weve not only kept peace for our own country, but weve been able to extend the benefits of peace to others. In the Middle East, weve worked for a peace treaty between Israel and Egypt, successfully, and have tied ourselves together with Israel and Egypt in a common defense capability. This is a very good step forward for our nations security, and well continue to do as we have done in the past. I might also add that there are decisions that are made in the Oval Office by every President which are profound in nature. There are always trouble spots in the world, and how those troubled areas are addressed by a President alone in that Oval Office affects our nation directly, the involvement of the United States and also our American interests. That is a basic decision that has to be made so frequently, by every President who serves. That is what I have tried to do successfully by keeping our country at peace.",1980-10-28,Democrat,336,"Mr. Stone, can you share how your experiences in the Oval Office have shaped your approach to national security and the decision-making process in times of international conflict?"
29,Mr. Carter,"Mr. Stone, in my State of the Union address earlier this year, I pointed out that any threat to the stability or security of the Persian Gulf would be a threat to the security of our own country. In the past, we have not had an adequate military presence in that region. Now we have two major carrier task forces. We have access to facilities in five different areas of that region. And weve made it clear that working with our allies and others, that we are prepared to address any foreseeable eventuality which might interrupt commerce with that crucial area of the world. But in doing this, we have made sure that we address this question peacefully, not injecting American military forces into combat, but letting the strength of our nation be felt in a beneficial way. This, I believe, has assured that our interests will be protected in the Persian Gulf region, as we have done in the Middle East and throughout the world.",1980-10-28,Democrat,166,"Mr. Stone, how do you see the role of American military presence in the Persian Gulf impacting our national security and international relations, particularly in terms of maintaining peace while ensuring our interests are protected?"
30,Mr. Carter,"Well, there are various elements of defense. One is to control nuclear weapons, which I hope well get to later on because that is the most important single issue in this campaign. Another one is how to address troubled areas of the world. I think, habitually, Governor Reagan has advocated the injection of military forces into troubled areas, when I and my predecessors  both Democrats and Republicans  have advocated resolving those troubles in those difficult areas of the world peacefully, diplomatically, and through negotiation. In addition to that, the build-up of military forces is good for our country because weve got to have military strength to preserve the peace. But Ill always remember that the best weapons are the ones that are never fired in combat, and the best soldier is one who never has to lay his life down on the field of battle. Strength is imperative for peace, but the two must go hand in hand.",1980-10-28,Democrat,158,"How do you envision the role of military strength in achieving global peace, and what specific strategies would you advocate to manage international conflicts without resorting to military intervention?"
31,Mr. Carter,"Again its important to put the situation in perspective. In 1974, we had a so-called oil shock, wherein the price of OPEC oil was raised to an extraordinary degree. We had an even worse oil shock in 1979. In 1974, we had the worst recession, the deepest and most penetrating recession since the Second World War. The recession that resulted this time was the briefest since the Second World War. In addition, weve brought down inflation. Earlier this year, in the first quarter, we did have a very severe inflation pressure brought about by the OPEC price increase. It averaged about 18% in the first quarter of this year. In the second quarter, we had dropped it down to about 13%. The most recent figures, the last three months, on the third quarter of this year, the inflation rate is 7%  still too high, but it illustrates very vividly that in addition to providing an enormous number of jobs  nine million new jobs in the last three and a half years  that the inflationary threat is still urgent on us. I notice that Governor Reagan recently mentioned the Reagan-Kemp-Roth proposal. which his own running mate, George Bush, described as voodoo economics, and said that it would result in a 30% inflation rate. And Business Week, which is not a Democratic publication, said that this Reagan-Kemp-Roth proposal  and I quote them, I think  was completely irresponsible and would result in inflationary pressures which would destroy this nation. So our proposals are very sound and very carefully considered to stimulate jobs, to improve the industrial complex of this country, to create tools for American workers, and at the same time would be anti-inflationary in nature. So to add nine million new jobs, to control inflation, and to plan for the future with an energy policy now intact as a foundation is our plan for the years ahead.",1980-10-28,Democrat,315,How do you assess the current state of the economy in relation to past oil shocks and the measures you've proposed to control inflation while creating jobs?
32,Mr. Carter,"Yes. We have demanded that the American people sacrifice, and they have done very well. As a matter of fact, were importing today about one-third less oil from overseas than we did just a year ago. Weve had a 25% reduction since the first year I was in office. At the same time, as I have said earlier, we have added about nine million net new jobs in that period of time  a record never before achieved. Also, the new energy policy has been predicated on two factors: One is conservation, which requires sacrifice, and the other one, increase in production of American energy, which is going along very well  more coal this year than ever before in American history, more oil and gas wells drilled this year than ever before in history. The new economic revitalization program that we have in mind, which will be implemented next year, would result in tax credits which would let business invest in new tools and new factories to create even more new jobs  about one million in the next two years. And we also have planned a youth employment program which would encompass 600,000 jobs for young people. This has already passed the House, and it has an excellent prospect to pass the Senate.",1980-10-28,Democrat,212,"What sacrifices do you believe the American people have made in the pursuit of your energy policy, and how do you assess the impact of these sacrifices on job creation and economic growth?"
33,Mr. Carter,"Governor Reagans proposal, the Reagan-Kemp-Roth proposal, is one of the most highly inflationary ideas that ever has been presented to the American public. He would actually have to cut Government spending by at least $130 billion in order to balance the budget under this ridiculous proposal. I notice that his task force that is working for his future plans had some of their ideas revealed in The Wall Street Journal this week. One of those ideas was to repeal the minimum wage, and several times this year, Governor Reagan has said that the major cause of unemployment is the minimum wage. This is a heartless kind of approach to the working families of our country, which is typical of many Republican leaders of the past, but, I think, has been accentuated under Governor Reagan. In California  Im surprised Governor Reagan brought this up  he had the three largest tax increases in the history of that state under his administration. He more than doubled state spending while he was Governor  122% increase  and had between a 20% and 30% increase in the number of employees",1980-10-28,Democrat,184,"Governor, can you address concerns regarding your economic proposals, particularly the implications of the Reagan-Kemp-Roth plan on government spending and unemployment, and elaborate on your views about minimum wage and its impact on working families?"
34,Mr. Carter,"Thank you, Mr. Hilliard. When I was campaigning in 1976, everywhere I went, the mayors and local officials were in despair about the rapidly deteriorating central cities of our nation. We initiated a very fine urban renewal program, working with the mayors, the governors, and other interested officials. This has been a very successful effort. Thats one of the main reasons that weve had such an increase in the number of people employed. Of the nine million people put to work in new jobs since Ive been in office, 1.3 million of those has been among black Americans, and another million among those who speak Spanish. We now are planning to continue the revitalization program with increased commitments of rapid transit, mass transit. Under the windfall profits tax, we expect to spend about $43 billion in the next 10 years to rebuild the transportation systems of our country. We also are pursuing housing programs. Weve had a 73% increase in the allotment of Federal funds for improved education. These are the kinds of efforts worked on a joint basis with community leaders, particularly in the minority areas of the central cities that have been deteriorating so rapidly in the past. Its very important to us that this be done with the full involvement of minority citizens. I have brought into the top level, top levels of government, into the White House, into administrative offices of the Executive branch, into the judicial system, highly qualified black and Spanish citizens and women who in the past had been excluded. I noticed that Governor Reagan said that when he was a young man that there was no knowledge of a racial problem in this country. Those who suffered from discrimination because of race or sex certainly knew we had a racial problem. We have gone a long way toward correcting these problems, but we still have a long way to go.",1980-10-28,Democrat,318,What specific initiatives or programs have you implemented during your administration to address urban renewal and improve economic opportunities for marginalized communities?
35,Mr. Carter,"Ours is a nation of refugees, a nation of immigrants. Almost all of our citizens came here from other lands and now have hopes, which are being realized, for a better life, preserving their ethnic commitments, their family structures, their religious beliefs, preserving their relationships with their relatives in foreign countries, but still holding themselves together in a very coherent society, which gives our nation its strength. In the past, those minority groups have often been excluded from participation in the affairs of government. Since Ive been President, Ive appointed, for instance, more than twice as many black Federal judges as all previous presidents in the history of this country. Ive done the same thing in the appointment of women, and also Spanish-speaking Americans. To involve them in the administration of government and the feeling that they belong to the societal structure that makes decisions in the judiciary and in the executive branch is a very important commitment which I am trying to realize and will continue to do so in the future.",1980-10-28,Democrat,173,"How do you view the role of diversity in shaping the identity of our nation, and what specific initiatives have you implemented to ensure that underrepresented communities have a voice in government?"
36,Mr. Carter,"Its obvious that we still have a long way to go in fully incorporating the minority groups into the mainstream of American life. We have made good progress, and there is no doubt in my mind that the commitment to unemployment compensation, the minimum wage, welfare, national health insurance, those kinds of commitments that have typified the Democratic party since ancient history in this countrys political life are a very important element of the future. In all those elements, Governor Reagan has repeatedly spoken out against them, which, to me, shows a very great insensitivity to giving deprived families a better chance in life. This, to me, is a very important difference between him and me in this election, and I believe the American people will judge accordingly. There is no doubt in my mind that in the downtown central cities, with the, with the new commitment on an energy policy, with a chance to revitalize homes and to make them more fuel efficient, with a chance for our synthetic fuels program, solar power, this will give us an additional opportunity for jobs which will pay rich dividends.",1980-10-28,Democrat,188,"What do you see as the most pressing issues facing minority communities today, and how do your policies differ from your opponent's in addressing those concerns?"
37,Mr. Carter,"Barbara, one of the blights on this world is the threat and the activities of terrorists. At one of the recent economic summit conferences between myself and the other leaders of the western world, we committed ourselves to take strong action against terrorism. Airplane hijacking was one of the elements of that commitment. There is no doubt that we have seen in recent years  in recent months  additional acts of violence against Jews in France and, of course, against those who live in Israel, by the PLO and other terrorist organizations. Ultimately, the most serious terrorist threat is if one of those radical nations, who believe in terrorism as a policy, should have atomic weapons. Both I and all my predecessors have had a deep commitment to controlling the proliferation of nuclear weapons. In countries like Libya or Iraq, we have even alienated some of our closest trade partners because we have insisted upon the control of the spread of nuclear weapons to those potentially terrorist countries. When Governor Reagan has been asked about that, he makes the very disturbing comment that non-proliferation, or the control of the spread of nuclear weapons, is none of our business. And recently when he was asked specifically about Iraq, he said there is nothing we can do about it. This ultimate terrorist threat is the most fearsome of all, and its part of a pattern where our country must stand firm to control terrorism of all kinds.",1980-10-28,Democrat,244,What specific actions do you propose the United States take to combat the growing threat of terrorism and nuclear proliferation in regions known for supporting terrorist activities?
38,Mr. Carter,"We will maintain our position of neutrality in the Iran and Iraq war. We have no plans to sell additional materiel or goods to Iran, that might be of a warlike nature. When I made my decision to stop all trade with Iran as a result of the taking of our hostages, I announced then, and have consistently maintained since then, that if the hostages are released safely, we would make delivery on those items which Iran owns  which they have bought and paid for  also, that the frozen Iranian assets would be released. Thats been a consistent policy, one I intend to carry out.",1980-10-28,Democrat,105,"What is your administration's approach to U.S. relations with Iran, particularly in the context of the ongoing conflict in Iraq?"
39,Mr. Carter,"I didnt hear any comment from Governor Reagan about what he would do to stop or reduce terrorism in the future. What the Western allies did decide to do is to stop all air flights  commercial air flights  to any nation involved in terrorism or the hijacking of air planes, or the harboring of hijackers. Secondly, we all committed ourselves, as have all my predecessors in the Oval Office not to permit the spread of nuclear weapons to a terrorist nation, or to any other nation that does not presently have those weapons or capabilities for explosives. Third, not to make any sales of materiel or weapons to a nation which is involved in terrorist activities. And, lastly, not to deal with the PLO until and unless the PLO recognizes Israels right to exist and recognizes UN Resolution 242 as a basis for Middle East peace. These are a few of the things to which our nation is committed, and we will continue with these commitments.",1980-10-28,Democrat,166,"What specific measures do you believe are necessary to address the ongoing threat of terrorism, and how do those compare to the actions proposed by your opponent?"
40,Mr. Carter,"Yes, Id be glad to. Inflation. unemployment, the cities are all very important issues, but they pale into insignificance in the life and duties of a President when compared with the control of nuclear weapons. Every President who has served in the Oval Office since Harry Truman has been dedicated to the proposition of controlling nuclear weapons. To negotiate with the Soviet Union a balanced, controlled, observable, and then reducing levels of atomic weaponry, there is a disturbing pattern in the attitude of Governor Reagan. He has never supported any of those arms control agreements  the limited test ban, SALT I, nor the Antiballistic Missile Treaty, nor the Vladivostok Treaty negotiated with the Soviet Union by President Ford  and now he wants to throw into the wastebasket a treaty to control nuclear weapons on a balanced and equal basis between ourselves and the Soviet Union, negotiated over a seven-year period, by myself and my two Republican predecessors. The Senate has not voted yet on the Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty. There have been preliminary skirmishing in the committees of the Senate, but the Treaty has never come to the floor of the Senate for either a debate or a vote. Its understandable that a Senator in the preliminary debates can make an irresponsible statement, or, maybe, an ill-advised statement. Youve got 99 other senators to correct that mistake, if it is a mistake. But when a man who hopes to be President says, take this treaty, discard it, do not vote, do not debate, do not explore the issues, do not finally capitalize on this long negotiation  that is a very dangerous and disturbing thing.",1980-10-28,Democrat,274,"What is your stance on arms control agreements, particularly in relation to the overall responsibilities of a President in ensuring national security?"
41,Mr. Carter,"Yes. Governor Reagan is making some very misleading and disturbing statements. He not only advocates the scrapping of this treaty  and I dont know that these men that he quotes are against the treaty in its final form  but he also advocates the possibility, he said its been a missing element, of playing a trump card against the Soviet Union of a nuclear arms race, and is insisting upon nuclear superiority by our own nation, as a predication for negotiation in the future with the Soviet Union. If President Brezhnev said, we will scrap this treaty, negotiated under three American Presidents over a seven-year period of time, we insist upon nuclear superiority as a basis for future negotiations, and we believe that the launching of a nuclear arms race is a good basis for future negotiations, its obvious that I, as President, and all Americans, would reject such a proposition. This would mean the resumption of a very dangerous nuclear arms race. It would be very disturbing to American people. It would change the basic tone and commitment that our nation has experienced ever since the Second World War, with al Presidents, Democratic and Republican. And it would also be very disturbing to our allies, all of whom support this nuclear arms treaty. In addition to that, the adversarial relationship between ourselves and the Soviet Union would undoubtedly deteriorate very rapidly. This attitude is extremely dangerous and belligerent in its tone, although its said with a quiet voice.",1980-10-28,Democrat,248,"Governor, you've expressed concerns about your opponent's stance on nuclear arms negotiations. Could you elaborate on how you believe these positions could impact U.S. foreign policy and global security?"
42,Mr. Carter,"I think, to close out this discussion, it would be better to put into perspective what were talking about. I had a discussion with my daughter, Amy, the other day, before I came here, to ask her what the most important issue was. She said she thought nuclear weaponry  and the control of nuclear arms. This is a formidable force. Some of these weapons have 10 megatons of explosion. If you put 50 tons of TNT in each one of railroad cars, you would have a carload of TNT  a trainload of TNT stretching across this nation. Thats one major war explosion in a warhead. We have thousands, equivalent of megaton, or million tons, of TNT warheads. The control of these weapons is the single major responsibility of a President, and to cast out this commitment of all Presidents, because of some slight technicalities that can be corrected, is a very dangerous approach.",1980-10-28,Democrat,153,"What do you believe is the most pressing security threat facing the nation today, and how would you approach the issue of nuclear arms control as a key responsibility of the presidency?"
43,Mr. Carter,"I dont think theres any doubt that, in the future, the cost of oil is going to go up. What Ive had as a basic commitment since Ive been President is to reduce our dependence on foreign oil. It can only be done in two ways: one, to conserve energy  to stop the waste of energy  and, secondly, to produce more American energy. Weve been very successful in both cases. Weve now reduced the importing of foreign oil in the last year alone by one-third. We imported today 2 million barrels of oil less than we did the same date just a year ago. This commitment has been opening up a very bright vista for our nation in the future, because with the windfall profits tax as a base, we now have an opportunity to use American technology and American ability and American natural resources to expand rapidly the production of synthetic fuels, yes; to expand rapidly the production of solar energy, yes; and also to produce the traditional kinds of American energy. We will drill more oil and gas wells this year than any year in history. Well produce more coal this year than any year in history. We are exporting more coal this year than any year in history. And we have an opportunity now with improved transportation systems and improved loading facilities in our ports, to see a very good opportunity on a world international market, to replace OPEC oil with American coal as a basic energy source. This exciting future will not only give us more energy security, but will also open up vast opportunities for Americans to live a better life and to have millions of new jobs associated with this new and very dynamic industry now in prospect because of the new energy policy that weve put into effect.",1980-10-28,Democrat,305,What specific steps do you believe the United States should take to increase energy independence and reduce reliance on foreign oil in the coming years?
44,Mr. Carter,"To repeat myself, we have this year the opportunity, which well realize, to produce 800 million tons of coal  an unequaled record in the history of our country. Governor Reagan says that this is not a good achievement, and he blames restraints on coal production on regulations  regulations that affect the life and the health and safety of miners, and also regulations that protect the purity of our air and the quality our water and our land. We cannot cast aside these regulations. We have a chance in the next 15 years, insisting upon the health and safety of workers in the mines, and also preserving the same high air and water pollution standards, to triple the amount of coal we produce. Governor Reagans approach to our energy policy, which has already proven its effectiveness, is to repeal, or to change substantially, the windfall profits tax  to return a major portion of $227 billion back to the oil companies; to do away with the Department of Energy; to short-circuit our synthetic fuels program; to put a minimal emphasis on solar power; to emphasize strongly nuclear power plants as a major source of energy in the future. He wants to put all our eggs in one basket and give that basket to the major oil companies.",1980-10-28,Democrat,215,"What is your vision for balancing energy production with environmental protection, and how do you respond to criticisms regarding regulations that affect both miners' safety and environmental standards?"
45,Mr. Carter,"Sure. As a matter of fact,. the air pollution standard laws that were passed in California were passed over the objections of Governor Reagan, and this is a very well-known fact. Also, recently, when someone suggested that the Occupational Safety and Health Act should be abolished, Governor Reagan responded, amen. The offshore drilling rights is a question that Governor Reagan raises often. As a matter of fact, in the proposal for the Alaska lands legislation, 100% of all the offshore lands would be open for exploration, and 95% of all the Alaska lands, where it is suspected or believed that minerals might exist. We have, with our five-year plan for the leasing of offshore lands, proposed more land to be drilled than has been opened up for drilling since this program first started in 1954. So were not putting restraints on American exploration, were encouraging it in every way we can.",1980-10-28,Democrat,151,"How do you respond to concerns that your administration's policies may prioritize economic interests over environmental protections, particularly in light of historical decisions regarding air quality and offshore drilling?"
46,Mr. Carter,"As long as there is a Democratic President in the White House, we will have a strong and viable Social Security System, free of the threat of bankruptcy. Although Governor Reagan has changed his position lately, on four different occasions, he has advocated making Social Security a voluntary system, which would, in effect, very quickly bankrupt it. I noticed also in The Wall Street Journal early this week, that a preliminary report of his task force advocates making Social Security more sound by reducing the adjustment in Social Security for the retired people to compensate for the impact of inflation. These kinds of approaches are very dangerous to the security, the well being and the peace of mind of the retired people of this country and those approaching retirement age. But no matter what it takes in the future to keep Social Security sound, it must be kept that way. And although there was a serious threat to the Social Security System and its integrity during the 1976 campaign and when I became President, the action of the Democratic Congress working with me has been to put Social Security back on a sound financial basis. That is the way it will stay.",1980-10-28,Democrat,202,"How do you envision the future of the Social Security System in America, and what specific policies would you support to ensure its stability and security for retirees?"
47,Mr. Carter,"These constant suggestions that the basic Social Security System should be changed does call for concern and consternation among the aged of our country. It is obvious that we should have a commitment to them, that Social Security benefits should not be taxed and that there would be no peremptory change in the standards by which Social Security payments are made to retired people. We also need to continue to index Social Security payments, so that if inflation rises, the Social Security payments would rise a commensurate degree to let the buying power of a Social Security check continue intact. In the past, the relationship between Social Security and Medicare has been very important to providing some modicum of aid for senior citizens in the retention of health benefits. Governor Reagan, as a matter of fact, began his political career campaigning around this nation against Medicare. Now, we have an opportunity to move toward national health insurance, with an emphasis on the prevention of disease, an emphasis on out-patient care, not in-patient care; an emphasis on hospital cost containment to hold down the cost of hospital care far those who are ill, an emphasis on catastrophic health insurance, so that if a family is threatened with being wiped out economically because of a very high medical bill, then the insurance would help pay for it. These are the kinds of elements of a national health insurance, important to the American people. Governor Reagan, again, typically is against such a proposal.",1980-10-28,Democrat,250,"What specific measures do you believe should be taken to ensure the stability and sustainability of Social Security and Medicare for future generations, especially considering the concerns of elderly citizens?"
48,Mr. Carter,"I think this debate on Social Security, Medicare, national health insurance typifies, as vividly any other subject tonight, the basic historical differences between the Democratic Party and Republican Party. The allusions to basic changes in the minimum wage is another, and the deleterious comments that Governor Reagan has made about unemployment compensation. These commitments that the Democratic Party has historically made to the working families of this nation have been extremely important to the growth in their stature and in a better quality of life for them. I noticed recently that Governor Reagan frequently quotes Democratic presidents in his acceptance address. I have never heard a candidate for President, who is a Republican, quote a Republican president, but when they get in office, they try to govern like Republicans. So, it is good fo the American people to remember that there is a sharp basic historical difference between Governor Reagan and me on these crucial issues  also, between the two parties that we represent.",1980-10-28,Democrat,164,"What do you believe are the key historical differences between the Democratic and Republican parties regarding Social Security and healthcare, and how do these differences impact working families?"
49,Mr. Carter,"Barbara, reluctant as I am to say anything critical about Governor Reagan, I will try to answer your question. First of all, there is the historical perspective that I just described. This is a contest between a Democrat in the mainstream of my party, as exemplified by the actions that I have taken in the Oval Office the last four years, as contrasted with Governor Reagan, who in most cases does typify his party, but in some cases, there is a radical departure by him from the heritage of Eisenhower and others. The most important crucial difference in this election campaign, in my judgment, is the approach to the control of nuclear weaponry and the inclination to control or not to control the spread of atomic weapons to other nations who dont presently have it, particularly terrorist nations. The inclination that Governor Reagan has exemplified in many troubled times since he has been running for President  I think since 1968  to inject American military forces in places like North Korea, to put a blockade around Cuba this year, or in some instances, to project American forces into a fishing dispute against the small nation of Ecuador on the west coast of South America. This is typical of his long-standing inclination, on the use of American power, not to resolve disputes diplomatically and peacefully, but to show that the exercise of military power is best proven by the actual use of it. Obviously, no President wants war, and I certainly do not believe that Governor Reagan, if he were President, would want war, but a President in the Oval Office has to make a judgment on almost a daily basis about how to exercise the enormous power of our country for peace, through diplomacy, or in a careless way in a belligerent attitude which has exemplified his attitudes in the past.",1980-10-28,Democrat,310,"Governor, could you elaborate on the differences in your approach to foreign policy and military engagement compared to Governor Reagan, particularly in relation to nuclear weapon control and the use of American military force abroad?"
50,Mr. Carter,"I mentioned the radical departure of Governor Reagan from the principles or ideals of historical perspective of his own party. I dont think that can be better illustrated than in the case of guaranteeing women equal rights under the Constitution of our nation. For 40 years, the Republican Party platforms called for guaranteeing women equal rights with a constitutional amendment. Six predecessors of mine who served in the Oval Office called for this guarantee of womens rights. Governor Reagan and his new Republican Party have departed from this commitment  a very severe blow to the opportunity for women to finally correct discrimination under which they have suffered. When a man and a women do the same amount of work, a man gets paid $1.00, a women only gets paid 59 cents. And the equal rights amendment only says that equality of rights shall not be abridged for omen b the Federal Government or by he state governments. That is all it says a simple guarantee of equality of opportunity which typifies the Democratic arty, and which is a very important commitment of mine, as contrasted with Governor Reagans radical departure from the long-standing policy of his own party.",1980-10-28,Democrat,198,How do you view the Republican Party's historical commitment to women's rights and how do you believe that commitment has shifted under Governor Reagan's leadership?
51,Mr. Carter,"Howard, Im a Southerner, and I share the basic beliefs of my region that an excessive government intrusion into the private affairs of American citizens and also into the private affairs of the free enterprise system. One of the commitments that I made was to deregulate the major industries of this country. Weve been remarkably successful, with the help of a Democratic Congress. We have deregulated the air industry, the rail industry, the trucking industry, financial institutions. Were now working on the communications industry. In addition to that, I believe that this element of discrimination is something that the South has seen so vividly as a blight on our region of the country which has now been corrected  not only racial discrimination but discrimination against people that have to work for a living  because we have been trying to pick ourselves up by our bootstraps, since the long depression years, and lead a full and useful life in the affairs of this country. We have made remarkable success. It is part of my consciousness and of my commitment to continue this progress. So, my heritage as a Southerner, my experience in the Oval Office, convinces me that what I have just described is a proper course for the future.",1980-10-28,Democrat,209,"How do you view the role of government in regulating industries, and what impact do you believe deregulation has had on both economic growth and social equity in America?"
52,Mr. Carter,"First of all, Id like to thank the League of Women Voters for making this debate possible. I think its been a very constructive debate and I hope its helped to acquaint the American people with the sharp differences between myself and Governor Reagan. Also, I want to thank the people of Cleveland and Ohio for being such hospitable hosts during these last few hours in my life. Ive been President now for almost four years. Ive had to make thousands of decisions, and each one of those decisions has been a learning process. Ive seen the strength of my nation, and Ive seen the crises it approached in a tentative way. And Ive had to deal with those crises as best I could. As Ive studied the record between myself and Governor Reagan, Ive been impressed with the stark differences that exist between us. I think the result of this debate indicates that that fact is true. I consider myself in the mainstream of my party. I consider myself in the mainstream even of the bipartisan list of Presidents who served before me. The United States must be a nation strong; the United States must be a nation secure. We must have a society thats just and fair. And we must extend the benefits of our own commitment to peace, to create a peaceful world. I believe that since Ive been in office, there have been six or eight areas of combat evolved in other parts of the world. In each case, I alone have had to determine the interests of my country and the degree of involvement of my country. Ive done that with moderation, with care, with thoughtfulness; sometimes consulting experts. But, Ive learned in this last three and a half years that when an issue is extremely difficult, when the call is very close, the chances are the experts will be divided almost 50-50. And the final judgment about the future of the nation  war, peace, involvement, reticence, thoughtfulness, care, consideration, concern  has to be made by the man in the Oval Office. Its a lonely job, but with the involvement of the American people in the process, with an open Government, the job is a very gratifying one. The American people now are facing, next Tuesday, a lonely decision. Those listening to my voice will have to make a judgment about the future of this country. And I think they ought to remember that one vote can make a lot of difference. If one vote per precinct had changed in 1960, John Kennedy would never have been President of this nation. And if a few more people had gone to the polls and voted in 1968, Hubert Humphrey would have been President; Richard Nixon would not. There is a partnership involved in our nation. To stay strong, to stay at peace, to raise high the banner of human rights, to set an example for the rest of the world, to let our deep beliefs and commitments be felt by others in other nations, is my plan for the future. I ask the American people to join me in this partnership.",1980-10-28,Democrat,525,"What specific experiences from your time in office do you believe have shaped your approach to leadership and decision-making, particularly in regard to national security and international relations?"
53,Mr. Carter,"Well I think this Republican administration has been almost all style, and spectacular, and not substance. Weve uh  got a chance tonight to talk about, first of all, leadership, the character of our country, and a vision of the future. In every one of these instances, the Ford administration has failed, and I hope tonight that I and Mr. Ford will have a chance to discuss the reasons for those failures. Our country is not strong anymore; were not respected anymore. We can only be strong overseas if were strong at home; and when I became president well not only be strong in those areas but also in defense  a defense capability second to none. Weve lost in our foreign policy, the character of the American people. Weve uh  ignored or excluded the American people and the Congress from participation in the shaping of our foreign policy. Its been one of secrecy and exclusion. In addition to that weve had a chance to became now, contrary to our long-standing beliefs and principles, the arms merchant of the whole world. Weve tried to buy success from our enemies, and at the same time weve excluded from the process the normal friendship of our allies. In addition to that weve become fearful to compete with the Soviet Union on an equal basis. We talk about detente. The Soviet Union knows what they want in detente, and theyve been getting it. We have not known what weve wanted and weve been out-traded in almost every instance. The other point I wanna make is about our defense. Weve got to be a nation blessed with a defense capability thats efficient, tough, capable, well organized, narrowly focused  fighting capability. The ability to fight, if necessary, is the best way to avoid the chance for, or the requirement to fight. And the last point I wanna make is this: Mr. Ford, Mr. Kissinger have uh  continued on with the policies and failures of Richard Nixon. Even the Republican platform has criticized the lack of leadership in Mr. Ford and theyve criticized the foreign policy of this administration. This is one instance where I agree with  with the Republican platform. I might say this in closing, and that is that as far as foreign policy goes, Mr. Kissinger has been the president of this country. Mr. Ford has shown an absence of leadership, and an absence of a grasp of what this country is and what it ought to be. Thats got to be changed. And thats one of the major issues in this uh  campaign of 1976.",1976-10-06,Democrat,431,"What do you believe are the primary failures of the current administration in their foreign policy, and how would you address these issues if elected?"
54,Mr. Carter,"Well, Mr. Ford, unfortunately, has just made a statement thats not true. I have never advocated a Communist government for Italy. That would obviously be a ridiculous thing for anyone to do who wanted to be president of this country. I think that this is uh  an instance of uh  deliberate distortion, and this has occurred also in the question about defense. As a matter of fact, uh  Ive never advocated any cut of $15 billion in our defense budget. As a matter of fact, Mr. Ford has made a political football out of the defense budget. About a year ago he cut the Pentagon budget six point eight billion dollars. After he fired James Schlesinger, the political heat got so great that he added back about $3 billion. When Ronald Reagan won the Texas primary election, Mr. Ford added back another one and a half billion dollars. Immediately before the Kansas City convention, he added back another one point eight billion dollars in the defense budget. And his own uh  Office of Management and Budget testified that he had a $3 billion cut insurance added to the defense budget  defense budget under the pressure from the Pentagon. Obviously, this is another indication of trying to use the defense budget for political purposes, which hes trying to do tonight. Now, we went into south Africa late, after Great Britain, Rhodesia, the black nations had been trying to solve this problem for many, many years. We didnt go in until right before the election, similar to what was taking place in 1972, when Mr. Kissinger announced peace is at hand just before the election at that time. And we have weakened our position in NATO because the other countries in Europe supported the democ- democratic forces in Portugal long before we did; we stuck to the Portugal dictatorships much longer than other democracies did in this world.",1976-10-06,Democrat,316,"Mr. Ford, can you clarify your stance on defense spending and address the allegations regarding your administration's defense budget decisions?"
55,Mr. Carter,"Well, Im not gonna name my cabinet before I get elected. Ive got a little ways to go before I start doing that. But I have uh  an adequate background, I believe. I am a graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy, the first military graduate since uh  Eisenhower. Ive served as the Governor of Georgia and have traveled extensively in foreign countries and South America, Central America, Europe, the Middle East and in Japan. Ive traveled the last twenty-one months among the people of this country. Ive talked to them and Ive listened. And Ive seen at first hand, in a very vivid way, the deep hurt thats come to this country in the aftermath of Vietnam and Cambodia, Chile, and Pakistan, and Angola, and Watergate, CIA revelations. What we were formerly so proud of  the strength of our country, its uh  moral integrity, the representation in foreign affairs of what our people are, what our Constitution stands for, has been gone. And in the secrecy that has surrounded our foreign policy in the last few years, uh  the American people, the Congress have been excluded. I believe I know what this country ought to be. Ive uh  been one whos loved my nation as many Americans do, and I believe that theres no limit placed on what we can be in the future, if we can harness the tremendous resources  militarily, economically, and the stature of our people, the meaning of the Constitution, in the future. Every time weve made a serious mistake in foreign affairs, its been because the American people have been excluded from the process. If we can just tap the intelligence and ability, the sound common sense and the good judgment of the American people, we can once again have a foreign policy to make us proud instead of ashamed. And Im not gonna exclude the American people from that process in the future, as Mr. Ford and Kissinger have done. This is what it takes to have a sound foreign policy strong at home, strong defense, permanent commitments, not betray the principles of our country, and involve the American people and the Congress in the shaping of our foreign policy. Every time Mr. Ford speaks from a position of secrecy in negotiations, in secret  in secret treaties thatve been uh  pursued and achieved, in supporting dictatorships, in ignoring human rights, we are weak and the rest of the world knows it. So these are the ways that we can restore the strength of our country, and they dont require long experience in foreign policy. Nobody has that except a president who has served a long time or a secretary of state. But my background, my experience, my knowledge of the people of this country, my commitment to our principles that dont change  those are the best bases to correct the horrible mistakes of this administration and restore our own country to a position of leadership in the world.",1976-10-06,Democrat,494,"What is your vision for rebuilding America’s foreign policy, and how do you plan to involve the American public in that process?"
56,Mr. Carter,"First of all, I would quit conducting the decision-making process in secret, as has been a characteristic of Mr. Kissinger and Mr. Ford. In many instances weve made agreements, like in Vietnam, uh  that have uh  been revealed later on to our uh  embarrassment. Recently Ian Smith, the uh  president of uh  Rhodesia, announced that he had unequivocal commitments from Mr. Kissinger that he could not reveal. The American people dont know what those commitments are. Weve seen uh  in the past the destruction of elected governments, like in Chile, and the strong support of military dictatorship there. These kinds of things have hurt us very much. I would restore the concept of the fireside chat, which was an integral part of the administration of Franklin Roosevelt. And I would also restore the involvement of the Congress. When Harry Truman was president he was not afraid to have a strong secretary of defense. Dean Acheson, George Marshall were strong secretaries of uh  state  excuse me  state. But he also made sure that there was a bipartisan support. The members of Congress, Arthur Vandenberg, Walter George, were part of the process, and before our nation made a secret agreement, or before we made a bluffing statement, we were sure that we had the backing not only of the president and the secretary of state, but also of the Congress and the people. This is a responsibility of the president. And I think its very damaging to our country for Mr. Ford to have turned over this responsibility to the secretary of state.",1976-10-06,Democrat,261,"How would you approach the process of foreign policy decision-making differently than your opponent, particularly in terms of transparency and Congressional involvement?"
57,Mr. Carter,"(chuckle) Well, in the first place, Im not criticizing His Holiness the Pope. I was talking about Mr. Ford. The uh  fact is that secrecy has surrounded the decisions made by the Ford administration. In the case of the Helsinki agreement  it may have been a good agreement at the beginning, but we have failed to enforce the so-called basket three part, which insures the right of people to migrate, to join their families, to be free, to speak out. The Soviet Union is still jamming Radio Free Europe  Radio  uh- uh  Radio Free Europe is being jammed. Weve also seen a very serious uh  problem with the so-called Sonnenfeldt document, which apparently Mr. Ford has just endorsed, which said that theres an organic linkage between the Eastern European countries and the Soviet Union. And I would like to see Mr. Ford convince the Polish-Americans and the Czech-Americans and the Hungarian-Americans in this country that those countries dont live under the domination and supervision of the Soviet Union behind the Iron  uh  Curtain. We also have seen Mr. Ford exclude himself from access to the public. He hasnt had a tough cross-examination-type press conference in over thirty days. One press conference he had without sound. Hes also shown a weakness in yielding to pressure. The Soviet Union, for instance, put pressure on Mr. Ford and he refused to see a symbol of human freedom recognized around the world, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn. The Arabs have put pressure on Mr. Ford, and hes yielded, and has permitted a boycott by the Arab countries of American businesses who trade with Israel, or who have American Jews owning or taking part in the management of American  companies. His own secretary of commerce had to be subpoenaed by the Congress to reveal the names of businesses who were subject to this boycott. They didnt volunteer the information. He had to be subpoenaed. And the last thing Id like to say is this: This grain deal with the Soviet Union in 72 was terrible, and Mr. Ford made up for it with three embargoes, one against our own ally in Japan. Thats not the way to run our foreign policy, including international trade.",1976-10-06,Democrat,366,What is your assessment of the Ford administration's handling of international agreements and its approach to transparency with the American public regarding foreign policy decisions?
58,Mr. Carter,"I would never single out food as a trade embargo item. If I ever decided to impose an embargo because of a crisis in international relationships, it would include all shipments of all equipment. For instance, if the Arab countries ever again declare an embargo against our nation on oil I would consider that not a military but an economic declaration of war, and I would respond instantly and in kind. I would not ship that Arab country anything  no weapons, no spare parts for weapons, no oil-drilling rigs, no oil pipe, no nothing. I wouldnt single out just food. Another thing that Id like to say is this: In our international trade, as I said in my op- opening statement, we have become the arms merchant of the world. When this Republican administration came into office we were shipping about $1 billion worth of arms overseas, now ten to twelve billion dollars worth of arms overseas to countries that quite often use these weapons to fight each other. The shift in emphasis has been very disturbing to me, speaking about the Middle East. Under the last Democratic administration 60 percent of all weapons that went into the Middle East were for Israel. Nowadays  75 percent were for Israel before. Now 60 percent go to the Arab countries, and this does not include Iran. If you include Iran, our present shipment of weapons to the Middle East, only 20 percent goes to Israel. This is a deviation from idealism; its a deviation from a commitment to our major ally in the Middle East, which is Israel; its a yielding to economic pressure on the part of the Arabs on the oil issue; and its also a tremendous indication that under the Ford administration we have not addressed the energy policy adequately. We still have no comprehensive energy policy in this country. And its an overall sign of weakness. When we are weak at home economically  high unemployment, high inflation, a confused government, a wasteful defense establishment, this encourages the kind of pressure thats been put on us successfully. It wouldve been inconceivable ten  fifteen years ago, for us to be brought to our knees with an Arab oil embargo. But it was done three years ago and theyre still putting pressure on us from the Arab countries to our discredit around the world. These are the weaknesses that I see, and I believe its not just a matter of idealism. Its a matter of being tough. Its a matter of being strong. Its a matter of being consistent. Our priorities ought to be first of all to meet our own military needs, secondly to meet the needs of our allies and friends, and only then should we ship military equipment to foreign countries. As a matter of fact, Iran is gonna get eighty F-14s before we even meet our own Air Force orders for F-l4s. And the shipment of Spruance-class destroyers to Iran are much more highly sophisticated than the Spruance-class destroyers that are present being delivered to our own Navy. This is ridiculous and it ought to be changed.",1976-10-06,Democrat,520,"How would you address the balance of military support between Israel and Arab nations in light of recent international tensions, and what specific policies would you propose to strengthen our position in the Middle East?"
59,Mr. Carter,"If  Iran is not an Arab country, as you know, it is a Moslem country  but if Saudi Arabia should declare an oil embargo against us, then I would consider that an economic declaration of war. And I would make sure that the uh  Saudis understood this ahead of time so there would be no doubt in their mind. I think under those circumstances they would refrain from pushing us to our knees as they did in 1973 with their previous oil embargo.",1976-10-06,Democrat,83,"What steps would you take to address potential economic threats from countries in the Middle East, such as the possibility of an oil embargo?"
60,Mr. Carter,"Well, Id like to go back just one moment to the previous question, where uh  Mr. Ford, I think, confused the issue by trying to say that we are shipping Israel 40 percent of our aid. As a matter of fact, during this current year uh we are shipping Iran, or have contracted to ship to Iran, about seven and a half billion dollars worth of arms and also to Saudi Arabia, about seven and a half billion dollars worth of arms. Also in 1975, we almost brought Israel to their knees after the uh  Yom Kippur War by the so-called reassessment of our relationship to Israel. We in effect tried to make Israel the scapegoat for the problems in the Middle East. And this weakened our relationships with Israel a great deal and put a cloud on the total commitment that our people feel toward the Israelis. There ought to be a clear, unequivocal commitment without change to Israel. In the Far East I think we need to continue to be uh  strong and uh  I would certainly uh  pursue the uh  normalization of uh  relationships with the Peoples Republic of China. We opened a great opportunity in l972, which has pretty well been frittered  frit- frittered away under Mr. Ford, that ought to be a constant uh  inclination toward  uh  toward friendship. But I would never let that friendship with the Peoples Republic of China stand in the way of the preservation of the independence and freedom of the people on Taiwan.",1976-10-06,Democrat,254,How do you envision the United States balancing its military and diplomatic relationships with both Israel and other nations in the Middle East and Far East?
61,Mr. Carter,"Well, always in the past weve had an ability to have a strong defense and also have  to have a strong uh  domestic economy, and also to be strong in our reputation and influence within the community of nations. These uh  characteristics of our country have been endangered under Mr. Ford. Were no longer respected in a showdown vote in the United Nations or in  in any other international council were lucky to get 20 percent of the other nations to vote with us. Our allies feel that weve neglected them. The so-called Nixon shock against Japan had weakened our relationships there. Under this administration weve also had an inclination to keep separate the European countries, thinking that if they are separate, then we can dominate them and proceed with our secret, Lone Ranger-type diplomatic efforts. I would uh  also like to point out that we, in this country, have let our economy go down the drain. The worst inflation since the Great Depression. The highest unemployment of any developed nation of the world. We have a higher unemployment rate in this country than Great Britain, and West Germany. Our unemployment rate is twice as high as it is in Italy; its three or four times as high as it is  as it is in Japan. And that terrible circumstance in this country is exported overseas. We comprise about 30 percent of the worlds economic trade power influence. And when were weak at home  weaker than all our allies  that weakness weakens the whole free world. So strong economy is very important. Another thing that we need to do is to reestablish the good relationships that we ought to have between the United States and our natural allies and friends. They have felt neglected. And using that base of strength, and using the idealism, the honesty, the predictability, the commitment, the integrity of our own country, thats where our strength lies. And that would permit us to deal with the developing nations in a position of strength. Under this administration weve had a continuation of the so-called balance of power politics, where everything is looked on as a struggle between us on the one side, the Soviet Union on the other. Our allies  the smaller countries get trampled in the rush. What we need is to try to seek individualized bilateral relationships with countries, regardless of their size, and to establish world-order politics, which means that we want to preserve peace through strength. We also wanna revert back to the stature and the respect that our country had in previous administrations. Now, I cant say when this can come. But I can guarantee it will not come if Gerald Ford is reelected and this present policy is continued; it will come if Im elected.",1976-10-06,Democrat,464,How do you assess the current state of U.S. foreign policy and its impact on our international relationships and domestic economy?
62,Mr. Carter,"Well let me say very quickly that under President Johnson, in spite of the massive investment in the Vietnam War, he turned over a balanced budget to Mr. Nixon. The unemployment rate was less than 4 percent. The inflation rate under Kennedy and Johnson was about 2 percent  one-third what it is under this administration. So we did have at that time with good management, the ability to do both. I dont think that anybody can say that Johnson and Kennedy neglected the poor and the destitute people in this country or around the world. But I can say this: The number one responsibility of any president, above all else, is to guarantee the security of our nation  an ability to be free of the threat of attack, or blackmail and to carry out our obligations to our allies and friends, and to carry out a legitimate foreign policy. They must go hand in hand, but the security of this nation has got to come first.",1976-10-06,Democrat,166,"How do you balance the need for economic prosperity with the responsibility to ensure national security, particularly in times of international conflict?"
63,Mr. Carter,"Well, Mr. Ford acts like hes uh  running for president for the first time. Hes been in office two years, and there has been absolutely no progress made toward a new SALT agreement. He has learned the date of the expiration of SALT I, apparently. Weve seen, in this world, a development of a tremendous threat to us. As a nuclear engineer myself, I know the limitations and capabilities of atomic power. I also  know that as far as the human beings on this earth are concerned that the nonproliferation of atomic weapons is number one. Only the last few days with the election approaching, has Mr. Ford taken any interest in a nonproliferation movement. I advocated last May in a speech at the United Nations that we move immediately as a nation to declare a complete moratorium on the testing of all nuclear devices, both weapons and peaceful devices; that we not ship any more atomic fuel to a country that refuses to comply with strict controls over the waste which can be reprocessed into explosives. Ive also advocated that we stop the sale by Germany and France of  processing plants for Pakistan and Brazil. Mr. Ford hasnt moved on this. We also need to provide an adequate supply of enriched uranium. Mr. Ford, again, under pressure from the atomic energy lobby, has insisted that this reprocessing or rather re-en- enrichment be done by private industry and not by the existing uh  government uh  plants. This kind of confusion and absence of leadership has let us drift now for two years with a constantly increasing threat of atomic weapons throughout the world. We now have five nations that have atomic bombs that we know about. If we continue under Mr. Fords policy by 1985 or 90 well have twenty nations that have the capability of exploding atomic weapons. This has got to be stopped. That is one of the major challenges and major undertakings that I will assume as the next president.",1976-10-06,Democrat,333,"What specific actions would you propose to address the current challenges related to nuclear nonproliferation, and how do you evaluate the current administration's efforts in this area?"
64,Mr. Carter,"No, its not just campaign rhetoric. I think that militarily we are as strong as any nation on earth. I think we got to stay that way and continue to increase our capabilities to meet any potential threat. But as far as strength derived from commitment to principles, as far as strength derived from the unity within our country, as far as strength derived from the people, the Congress, the secretary of state, the president, sharing in the evolution and carrying-out of a foreign policy, as far as strength derived from the respect of our own allies and friends, their assurance that we will be staunch in our commitment, that we will not deviate and that well give them adequate attention, as far as  as strength derived from doing whats right  caring for the poor, providing food, becoming the breadbasket of the world instead of the arms merchant of the world  in those respects, were not strong. Also, well never be strong again overseas, unless were strong at home. And with our economy in such terrible disarray and getting worse by the month. Weve got five-hundred thousand more Americans unemployed today than we had three months ago. Weve got two and a half million more Americans out of work now than we had when Mr. Ford took office. This kind of deterioration in our economic strength is bound to weaken us around the world. And we not only have uh problems at home but we export those problems overseas. So as far as the respect of our own people toward our own government, as far as participating in the shaping of uh  concepts and commitments, as far as the trust of our country among the nations of the world, as far as dependence of our country in meeting the needs and obligations that weve expressed to our allies, as far as the respect of our country  even among our potential adversaries  we are weak. Potentially were strong. Under this administration that strength has not been realized.",1976-10-06,Democrat,336,"What do you believe is the main source of strength for the United States in maintaining its position on the global stage, and how can we strengthen both our domestic and international standing?"
65,Mr. Carter,"I notice that Mr. Ford didnt comment on the uh  prisons in Chile. This is an  a typical example, maybe of many others, where this administration overthrew an elected government and helped to establish a military dictatorship. This has not been an ancient history story. Last year under Mr. Ford, of all the Food for Peace that went to South America, 85 percent went to the military dictatorship in Chile. Another point I wanna make is this. He says we have to move from one area of the world to another. Thats one of the problems with this administrations so-called shuttle diplomacy. While the secretary of states in one country, there are almost a hundred and fifty others that are wondering what were gonna do next, what will be the next secret agreement. We dont have a comprehensive understandable foreign policy that deals with world problems or even regional problems. Another thing that concerned me was what Mr. Ford said about unemployment, that  insinuating that under Johnson and Kennedy that unemployment could only be held down when this country is at war. Karl Marx said that the free enterprise system in a democracy can only continue to exist when they are at war or preparing far war. Karl Marx was the grandfather of Communism. I dont agree with that statement. I hope Mr. Ford doesnt either. He has put pressure on the Congress  and I dont believe Mr. Ford would even deny this  to hold up on nonproliferation legislation until the Congress agreed for an $8 billion program for private industry to start producing enriched uranium. And the last thing I wanna make is this. He talks about peace and Im thankful for peace. We were peaceful when Mr. Ford went into office. But he and Mr. Kissinger and others tried to start a new Vietnam in Angola, and it was only the outcry of the American people and the Congress when their secret deal was discovered that prevented our involvement in that conflagration which was taking place there.",1976-10-06,Democrat,339,"What are your thoughts on the current U.S. foreign policy approach, particularly in relation to military dictatorships and conflicts like those seen in Chile and Angola?"
66,Mr. Carter,"Well, here again, uh  the Panamanian question is one thats been confused by Mr. Ford. Uh  he had directed his uh  diplomatic relation  uh  uh  representative to yield to the Panamanians full sovereignty over the Panama Canal Zone at the end of a certain period of time. When Mr. Reagan raised this uh  question in Florida uh  Mr. Ford not only disavowed his instructions, but he also even dropped, parenthetically, the use of the word detente. I would never give up complete control or practical control of the Panama Canal Zone, but I would continue to negotiate with the Panamanians. When the original treaty was signed back in the early 1900s, when Theodore Roosevelt was president, Panama retained sovereignty over the Panama Canal Zone. We retained control as though we had sovereignty. Now I would be willing to go ahead with negotiations. I believe that we could share more fully responsibilities for the Panama Canal Zone with Panama. I would be willing to continue to raise the payment for shipment of goods through the Panama Canal Zone. I might even be willing to reduce to some degree our military emplacements in the Panama Canal Zane, but I would not relinquish practical control of the Panama Canal Zane any time in the foreseeable future.",1976-10-06,Democrat,213,"How do you propose to handle the future of the Panama Canal, particularly in terms of sovereignty and control, given the current tensions and differing views on this issue?"
67,Mr. Carter,"Well, Im reluctant to uh comment on the recent report  I havent read it. I think the American people have only one  uh requirement  that the facts about Mayaguez be given to them accurately and completely. Mr. Ford has been there for eighteen months. He had the facts that were released today immediately after the Mayaguez incident. I understand that the report today is accurate. Mr. Ford has said, I believe, that it was accurate, and that the White House made no attempt to block the issuing of that report. I dont know if thats exactly accurate or not. I understand that both the  the uh  Department of State and the Defense Department have approved the accuracy of todays report, or yesterdays report, and also the National Security Agency. I dont know what was right, or what was wrong, or what was done. The only thing I believe is that whatever the  the knowledge was that Mr. Ford had should have been given to the American people eighteen months ago, immediately after the Mayaguez uh  incident occurred. This is uh  what the American people want. When something happens that endangers our security, or when something happens that threatens our stature in the world, or when American people are endangered by the actions of a foreign country, uh  just forty uh sailors on the Mayaguez, we obviously have to move aggressively and quickly to rescue them. But then after the immediate action is taken, I believe the president has an obligation to tell the American people the truth and not wait eighteen months later for the report to be issued.",1976-10-06,Democrat,269,"What are your thoughts on the timeliness and transparency of government communication in critical incidents, such as the Mayaguez incident, and how should a president ensure that the American people receive accurate information?"
68,Mr. Carter,"I believe that the boycott of American businesses by the Arab countries because those businesses trade with Israel or because they have American Jews who are owners or directors in the company is an absolute disgrace. This is the first time that Ive  remember in the history of our country when weve let a foreign country circumvent or change our Bill of Rights. Ill do everything I can as president to stop the boycott of American businesses by the Arab countries. Its not a matter of diplomacy or trade with me. Its a matter of morality. And I dont believe that Arab countries will pursue it when we have a strong president who will protect the integrity of our country, the commitment of our Constitution and Bill of Rights and protect people in this country who happen to be Jews. It may later be Catholics; it may be  later be Baptists who are threatened by some foreign country. But we ought to stand staunch. And I think its a disgrace that so far Mr. Fords administration has blocked the passage of legislation that wouldve revealed by law every instance of the boycott and it wouldve prevented the boycott from continuing.",1976-10-06,Democrat,200,"What is your stance on the impact of foreign boycotts on American businesses, and how would you address such issues as president?"
69,Mr. Carter,"One of the uh  most embarrassing uh  failures of the Ford administration, and one that touches specifically on human rights, is his refusal to appoint a presidential commission to go to Vietnam, to go to Laos, to go to Cambodia and try to trade for the release of information about those who are missing in action in those wars. This is what the families of MIAs want. So far, Mr. Ford has not done it. Weve had several fragmentary efforts by members of the Congress and by  by private citizens. Several months ago the Vietnam government said, We are ready to sit down and negotiate for release of information on MIAs. So far, Mr. Ford has not responded. I would never normalize relationships with Vietnam, nor permit them to join the United Nations until theyve taken this action. But thats not enough. We need to have an active and aggressive action on the part of the president, the leader of his country, to seek out every possible way to get that information which has kept the MIA families in despair and doubt, and Mr. Ford has just not done it.",1976-10-06,Democrat,190,"What are your views on the current administration's approach to addressing the issue of missing in action soldiers from the Vietnam War, and how would you propose to improve efforts to obtain information for their families?"
70,Mr. Carter,"The purpose of this debate and the outcome of the election will determine three basic things: Leadership, upholding the principles of our country, and proper priorities and commitments for the future. This election will also determine what kind of world we leave our children. Will it be a nightmare world threatened with the proliferation of atomic bombs, not just in five major countries but dozens of smaller countries that have been permitted to develop atomic weapons because of a failure of our top leadership to stop proliferation? Will we have a world of hunger and  and hatred, and will we be living in an armed camp stripped of our friendship and allies hiding behind a tight defense thats been drawn in around us because we are fearful of the outside world? Will we have a government of secrecy that excludes the American people from participation in making basic decisions and therefore covers up mistakes and makes it possible for our government  our government  to depart from the principles of our Constitution and Bill of Rights? Or will we have a world of peace with the threat of atomic weapons eliminated, with full trade, with our people at work, inflation controlled, openness in government, our people proud once again, Congress, citizens, president, secretary of state working in harmony and unity toward a common future? Or world where people have enough to eat and a world where we care about those who dont? Can we become a breadbasket of the world instead of the arms merchant of the world? I believe we can and we ought to. Now weve been hurt in recent years in this country. In the aftermath of Vietnam, Cambodia, Chile, Pakistan, Angola, Watergate, CIA, weve been hurt. Our people feel that weve lost something precious. Thats not necessary. I wanna see our nation  return to a posture and an image and a standard to make us proud once again. I remember the world with NATO, and the world of Point Four, and the world of the Marshall Plan, and the world of the Peace Corps. Why cant we have that once again? We ought to be a beacon for nations who search for peace and who search for freedom, who search for individual liberty, who search for basic human rights. We havent been lately. We can be once again. Well never have that world leadership until we are strong at home, and we can have that strength if we return to the basic principles. It ought not to be a strength of bombast and threats. It ought to be a quiet strength based on the integrity of our people, the vision of the Constitution, an in- innate strong will and purpose that Gods given us in the greatest nation on earth  the United States.",1976-10-06,Democrat,466,What do you believe are the key issues that this election will address regarding America's role in the world and the values that should guide our future leadership?
71,Mr. Mondale,"One of the key tests of leadership is whether one sees clearly the nature of the problems confronted by our nation. And perhaps the dominant domestic issue of our times is what do we do about these enormous deficits. I respect the President; I respect the Presidency, and I think he knows that. But the fact of it is, every estimate by this administration about the size of the deficit has been off by billions and billions of dollars. As a matter of fact, over 4 years, theyve missed the mark by nearly $600 billion. We were told we would have a balanced budget in 1983. It was $200 billion deficit instead. And now we have a major question facing the American people as to whether well deal with this deficit and get it down for the sake of a healthy recovery. Virtually every economic analysis that Ive heard of, including the distinguished Congressional Budget Office, which is respected by, I think, almost everyone, says that even with historically high levels of economic growth, we will suffer a $263 billion deficit. In other words, it doesnt converge as the President suggests. It gets larger even with growth. What that means is that we will continue to have devastating problems with foreign trade. This is the worst trade year in American history by far. Our rural and farm friends will have continued devastation. Real interest rates  the real cost of interest  will remain very, very high, and many economists are predicting that were moving into a period of very slow growth because the economy is tapering off and may be a recession. I get it down to a level below 2 percent of gross national product with a policy thats fair. Ive stood up and told the American people that I think its a real problem, that it can destroy long-term economic growth, and Ive told you what I think should be done. I think this is a test of leadership, and I think the American people know the difference.",1984-10-07,Democrat,339,"What do you believe is the most pressing economic challenge facing our country today, and how do you assess the current administration's approach to addressing the national deficit?"
72,Mr. Mondale,"Absolutely, and I proposed over a hundred billion dollars in cuts in Federal spending over 4 years, but I am not going to cut it out of Social Security and Medicare and student assistance and things  [applause]  that people need. These people depend upon all of us for the little security that they have, and Im not going to do it that way. The rate of defense spending increase can be slowed. Certainly we can find a coffeepot that costs something less than $7,000. And there are other ways of squeezing this budget without constantly picking on our senior citizens and the most vulnerable in American life. And thats why the Congress, including the Republicans, have not gone along with the Presidents recommendations.",1984-10-07,Democrat,123,"What specific areas of Federal spending do you believe could be cut without impacting essential services like Social Security, Medicare, and student assistance?"
73,Mr. Mondale,"Well, thats exactly the commitment that was made to the American people in 1980: He would never reduce benefits. And of course, what happened right after the election is they proposed to cut Social Security benefits by 25 percent  reducing the adjustment for inflation, cutting out minimum benefits for the poorest on Social Security, removing educational benefits for dependents whose widows were trying  with widows trying to get them through college. Everybody remembers that; people know what happened. Theres a difference. I have fought for Social Security and Medicare and for things to help people who are vulnerable all my life, and I will do it as President of the United States.",1984-10-07,Democrat,112,"How do you respond to concerns about the future of Social Security and Medicare, particularly in light of historical changes to these programs?"
74,Mr. Mondale,"Well, first of all, I think the first answer this evening suggests exactly what Im saying. There is no question that we face this massive deficit, and almost everybody agrees unless we get it down, the chances for long-term, healthy growth are nil. And its also unfair to dump these tremendous bills on our children. The President says it will disappear overnight because of some reason. No one else believes thats the case. I do, and Im standing up to the issue with an answer thats fair. I think thats what leadership is all about. Theres a difference between being a quarterback and a cheerleader, and when theres a real problem, a President must confront it. What I was referring to, of course, in the comment that you referred to was the situation in Lebanon. Now, for three occasions, one after another, our Embassies were assaulted in the same way by a truck with demolitions. The first time  and I did not criticize the President, because these things can happen  once, and sometimes twice  the second time the barracks in Lebanon were assaulted, as we all remember. There was two or three commission reports, recommendations by the CIA, the State Department, and the others, and the third time there was even a warning from the terrorists themselves. Now, I believe that a President must command that White House and those who work for him. Its the toughest job on Earth, and you must master the facts and insist that things that must be done are done. I believe that the way in which I will approach the Presidency is whats needed, because all my life that has been the way in which I have sought to lead. And thats why in this campaign Im telling you exactly what I want to do. I am answering your questions. I am trying to provide leadership now, before the election, so that the American people can participate in that decision.",1984-10-07,Democrat,327,How do you perceive the role of leadership in addressing major issues such as the national deficit and foreign policy challenges?
75,Mr. Mondale,"Well, I think were getting better all the time. And I think tonight, as we contrast for the first time our differing approach to government, to values, to the leadership in this country, I think as this debate goes forward, the American people will have for the first time a chance to weigh the two of us against each other. And I think, as a part of that process, what I am trying to say will come across, and that is that we must lead, we must command, we must direct, and a President must see it like it is. He must stand for the values of decency that the American people stand for, and he must use the power of the White House to try to control these nuclear weapons and lead this world toward a safer world.",1984-10-07,Democrat,139,"How do you view the role of the President in addressing national and global security challenges, especially concerning nuclear weapons, in comparison to your opponent's approach?"
76,Mr. Mondale,"Well, I guess Im reminded a little bit of what Will Rogers once said about Hoover. He said, Its not what he doesnt know that bothers me; its what he knows for sure that just aint so. [Laughter] The fact of it is: The Presidents budget sought to cut Social Security by 25 percent. Its not an opinion; its a fact. And when the President was asked the other day, What do you want to cut in the budget?, he said, Cut those things I asked for but didnt get. Thats Social Security and Medicare. The second fact is that the housing unit for senior citizens that the President dedicated in Buffalo was only made possible through a Federal assistance program for senior citizens that the Presidents budget sought to terminate. So, if hed had his way, there wouldnt have been any housing project there at all. This administration has taken a meat cleaver out, in terms of Federal-assisted housing, and the record is there. We have to see the facts before we can draw conclusions.",1984-10-07,Democrat,176,"What is your assessment of the current administration's budget priorities, especially regarding social safety nets like Social Security and housing for seniors?"
77,Mr. Mondale,"First of all, I accept President Reagans affirmation of faith. Im sure that we all accept and admire his commitment to his faith, and we are strengthened, all of us, by that fact. I am a son of a Methodist minister. My wife is the daughter of a Presbyterian minister. And I dont know if Ive been born again, but I know I was born into a Christian family. And I believe I have sung at more weddings and more funerals than anybody ever to seek the Presidency. Whether that helps or not, I dont know. I have a deep religious faith. Our family does. It is fundamental. Its probably the reason that Im in politics. I think our faith tells us, instructs us, about the moral life that we should lead. And I think were all together on that. What bothers me is this growing tendency to try to use ones own personal interpretation of faith politically, to question others faith, and to try to use the instrumentalities of government to impose those views on others. All history tells us that thats a mistake. When the Republican platform says that from here on out, were going to have a religious test for judges before theyre selected for the Federal court, and then Jerry Falwell announces that that means they get at least two Justices of the Supreme Court, I think thats an abuse of faith in our country. This nation is the most religious nation on Earth  more people go to church and synagogues than any other nation on Earth  and its because we kept the politicians and the state out of the personal exercise of our faith. Thats why faith in the United States is pure and unpolluted by the intervention of politicians. And I think if we want to continue  as I do  to have a religious nation, lets keep that line and never cross it.",1984-10-07,Democrat,319,"How do you view the role of personal faith in politics, and what do you think about the idea of using faith as a criterion for political positions or judicial appointments?"
78,Mr. Mondale,"No. What I object to  [applause]  what I object to  what I object to is someone seeking to use his faith to question the faith of another or to use that faith and seek to use the power of government to impose it on others. A minister who is in civil rights or in the conservative movement, because he believes his faith instructs him to do that, I admire. The fact that the faith speaks to us and that we are moral people, hopefully, I accept and rejoice in. Its when you try to use that to undermine the integrity of private political  or private religious faith and the use of the state is where  for the most personal decisions in American life  thats where I draw the line.",1984-10-07,Democrat,129,"What are your views on the role of personal faith in politics, and how do you believe it should influence the relationship between government and individual beliefs?"
79,Mr. Mondale,"The platform to which the President refers, in fact, calls for a religious test in the selection of judges. And Jerry Falwell says that means we get two or three judges. And it would involve a religious test for the first time in American life. It seems to me that a moments reflection tells you why the United States Senate turned that amendment down, because it will undermine the practice of honest faith in our country by politicizing it. We dont want that.",1984-10-07,Democrat,83,"What is your stance on the proposal to implement a religious test for the selection of judges, and how do you believe it could impact the independence of the judiciary and the practice of faith in America?"
80,Mr. Mondale,"My answer is that this campaign isnt over yet. And when people vote, I think youre going to see a very strong verdict by the American people that they favor the approach that Im talking about. The American people want arms control. They dont want this arms race. And they dont want this deadly new effort to bring weapons into the heavens. And they want an American foreign policy that leads toward a safer world. The American people see this debt, and they know its got to come down. And if it wont come down, the economys going to slow down, maybe go into a recession. They see this tremendous influx and swamping of cheap foreign imports in this country that has cost over 3 million jobs, given farmers the worst year in American history. And they know this debt must come down as well, because its unfair to our children. The American people want this environment protected. They know that these toxic waste dumps should have been cleaned up a long time ago, and they know that peoples lives and health are being risked, because weve had an administration that has been totally insensitive to the law and the demand for the protection of the environment. The American people want their children educated. They want to get our edge back in science, and they want a policy headed by the President that helps close this gap thats widening between the United States and Europe and Japan. The American people want to keep opening doors. They want those civil rights laws enforced. They want the equal rights amendment ratified. They want equal pay for comparable effort for women. And they want it because theyve understood from the beginning that when we open doors, were all stronger, just as we were at the Olympics. I think as you make the case, the American people will increasingly come to our cause.",1984-10-07,Democrat,319,"What key issues do you believe are most important to the American people in this campaign, and how do you plan to address them?"
81,Mr. Mondale,"Well, tonight we had the first debate over the deficit. The President says itll disappear automatically. Ive said its going to take some work. I think the American people will draw their own conclusions. Secondly, Ive said that I will not support the cuts in Social Security and Medicare and the rest that the President has proposed. The President answers that it didnt happen or, if it did, it was resolved later in a commission. As the record develops, I think its going to become increasingly clear that what I am saying and where I want to take this country is exactly where the country wants to go, and the comparison of approaches is such that I think will lead to further strength.",1984-10-07,Democrat,123,"What is your stance on the current budget deficit, and how do you propose to address it in relation to social safety net programs like Social Security and Medicare?"
82,Mr. Mondale,"The President says that when the Democratic Party made its turn, he left it. The year that he decided we had lost our way was the year that John F. Kennedy was running against Richard Nixon. I was chairman of Minnesotans for Kennedy; President Reagan was chairman of a thing called Democrats for Nixon. Now, maybe we made a wrong turn with Kennedy, but Ill be proud of supporting him all of my life. And Im very happy that John Kennedy was elected, because John Kennedy looked at the future with courage, saw what needed to be done, and understood his own government. The President just said that his government is shrinking. Its not. Its now the largest peacetime government ever in terms of the take from the total economy. And instead of retreating  instead of being strong where we should be strong, he wants to make it strong and intervene in the most private and personal questions in American life. Thats where government should not be.",1984-10-07,Democrat,167,"In reflecting on the evolution of your party and its leadership, can you describe a moment in history, perhaps during a significant campaign like Kennedy versus Nixon, that influenced your views on government size and its role in American lives?"
83,Mr. Mondale,"This is one of the most emotional and difficult issues that could possibly be debated. I think your questions, however, underscore the fact there is probably no way that government should or could answer this question in every individual case and in the private lives of the American people. The constitutional amendment proposed by President Reagan would make it a crime for a woman to have an abortion if she had been raped or suffered from incest. Is it really the view of the American people, however you feel on the question of abortion, that government ought to be reaching into your livingrooms and making choices like this? I think it cannot work, wont work, and will lead to all kinds of cynical evasions of the law. Those who can afford to have them will continue to have them. The disadvantaged will go out in the back alley as they used to do. I think these questions are inherently personal and moral, and every individual instance is different. Every American should be aware of the seriousness of the step. But there are some things that government can do and some things they cannot do. Now, the example that the President cites has nothing to do with abortion. Somebody went to a woman and nearly killed her. Thats always been a serious crime and always should be a serious crime. But how does that compare with the problem of a woman who is raped? Do we really want those decisions made by judges whove been picked because they will agree to find the person guilty? I dont think so, and I think its going in exactly the wrong direction. In America, on basic moral questions we have always let the people decide in their own personal lives. We havent felt so insecure that weve reached for the club of state to have our point of view. Its been a good instinct. And were the most religious people on Earth. One final point: President Reagan, as Governor of California, signed a bill which is perhaps the most liberal proabortion bill of any State in the Union.",1984-10-07,Democrat,354,"How do you view the government's role in personal moral decisions, particularly regarding issues like abortion, and do you believe it is appropriate for legislators to impose strict regulations that affect individual circumstances?"
84,Mr. Mondale,"The basic decision of the Supreme Court is that each person has to make this judgment in her own life, and thats the way its been done. And its a personal and private, moral judgment. I dont know the answer to when life begins. And its not that simple, either. Youve got another life involved. And if its rape, how do you draw moral judgments on that? If its incest, how do you draw moral judgments on that? Does every woman in America have to present herself before some judge picked by Jerry Falwell to clear her personal judgment? It wont work. [Applause]",1984-10-07,Democrat,103,"How do you believe the government should navigate the complex moral and personal issues surrounding reproductive rights, especially in cases of rape and incest?"
85,Mr. Mondale,"I agree with that, and thats why I was a principal sponsor of a liberal adoption law, so that more of these children could come to term, so that the young mothers were educated, so we found an option, an alternative. Im all for that. But the question is whether this other option proposed by the President should be pursued. And I dont agree with it. Since Ive got about 20 seconds, let me just say one thing. The question of agriculture came up a minute ago. Net farm income is off 50 percent in the last 3 years, and every farmer knows it. And the effect of these economic policies is like a massive grain embargo, which has caused farm exports to drop 20 percent. Its been a big failure. I opposed the grain embargo in my administration. Im opposed to these policies as well.",1984-10-07,Democrat,146,"What is your stance on the current agricultural policies and their impact on farmers, especially in relation to recent proposals put forth by the President?"
86,Mr. Mondale,"In my opinion, as we deal with this deficit, people from about $70,000 a year on down have to be dealt with very, very carefully, because they are the ones who didnt get any relief the first time around. Under the 1981 tax bill, people making $200,000 a year got $60,000 in tax relief over 3 years, while people making $30,000 a year, all taxes considered, got no relief at all or their taxes actually went up. Thats why my proposal protects everybody from $25,000 a year or less against any tax increases, and treats those $70,000 and under in a way that is more beneficial than the way the President proposes with a sales tax or a flat tax. What does this mean in real life? Well, the other day, Vice President Bush disclosed his tax returns to the American people. Hes one of the wealthiest Americans, and hes our Vice President. In 1981 I think he paid about 40 percent in taxes. In 1983, as a result of these tax preferences, he paid a little over 12 percent, 12.8 percent in taxes. That meant that he paid a lower percent in taxes than the janitor who cleaned up his office or the chauffeur who drives him to work. I believe we need some fairness. And thats why Ive proposed what I think is a fair and a responsible proposal that helps protect these people whove already got no relief or actually got a tax increase.",1984-10-07,Democrat,247,How do you believe your tax policy will address the concerns of middle and lower-income earners who feel they have been disproportionately impacted by previous tax reforms?
87,Mr. Mondale,"The first thing is, everybody 25,000 and under would have no tax increase. Mr. Reagan, after the election, is going to have to propose a tax increase, and you will have to compare what he proposes. And his Secretary of the Treasury said hes studying a sales tax or a value-added tax. Theyre the same thing. They hit middle- and moderate-income Americans and leave wealthy Americans largely untouched. Up until about $70,000, as you go up the ladder, my proposals will be far more beneficial. As soon as we get the economy on a sound ground as well, Id like to see the total repeal of indexing. I dont think we can do that for a few years. But at some point, we want to do that as well.",1984-10-07,Democrat,129,"What specific tax policies would you propose to ensure that low- and middle-income Americans are not disproportionately affected, especially in comparison to the potential tax increases under your opponent's plan?"
88,Mr. Mondale,"Well, first of all, I gave him the benefit of the doubt on the house deal. Im just talking about the 12.8 percent that he paid, and thats whats happening all over this country with wealthy Americans. Theyve got so many loopholes they dont have to pay much in taxes.",1984-10-07,Democrat,50,What are your thoughts on the current state of tax loopholes for wealthy Americans and their impact on the economy?
89,Mr. Mondale,"You said it when President Carter said that you were going to cut Medicare, and you said, Oh, no, there you go again, Mr. President. And what did you do right after the election? You went out and tried to cut $20 billion out of Medicare. And so, when you say, There you go again  people remember this, you know. [Laughter] And people will remember that you signed the biggest tax increase in the history of California and the biggest tax increase in the history of the United States, and what are you going to do? Youve got a $260 billion deficit. You cant wish it away. You wont slow defense spending; you refuse to do that",1984-10-07,Democrat,117,What specific actions would you take to address the current budget deficit while also ensuring the integrity of essential programs like Medicare?
90,Mr. Mondale,"Number one, weve got to get the debt down to get the interest rates down so the economy will grow and people will be employed. Number two, we have to work with cities and others to help generate economic growth in those communities  through the Urban Development Action Grant Program. I dont mind those enterprise zones; lets try them, but not as a substitute for the others. Certainly education and training is crucial. If these young Americans dont have the skills that make them attractive to employees, theyre not going to get jobs. The next thing is to try to get more entrepreneurship in business within the reach of minorities so that these businesses are located in the communities in which theyre found. The other thing is, we need the business community as well as government heavily involved in these communities to try to get economic growth. There is no question that the poor are worse off. I think the President genuinely believes that theyre better off. But the figures show that about 8 million more people are below the poverty line than 4 years ago. How you can cut school lunches, how you can cut student assistance, how you can cut housing, how you can cut disability benefits, how you can do all of these things and then the people receiving them  for example, the disabled, who have no alternative  how theyre going to do better, I dont know. Now, we need a tight budget, but theres no question that this administration has singled out things that affect the most vulnerable in American life, and theyre hurting. One final point if I might. Theres another part of the lopsided economy that were in today, and that is that these heavy deficits have killed exports and are swamping the Nation with cheap imports. We are now $120 billion of imports, 3 million jobs lost, and farmers are having their worst year. Thats another reason to get the deficit down.",1984-10-07,Democrat,329,"What specific steps do you believe are necessary to address economic inequality and support communities that are struggling, particularly in light of recent budget cuts and rising poverty levels?"
91,Mr. Mondale,"I think the American people want to make certain that that dollar is wisely spent. I think they stand for civil rights. I know theyre all for education in science and training, which I strongly support. They want these young people to have a chance to get jobs and the rest. I think the business community wants to get involved. I think theyre asking for new and creative ways to try to reach it with everyone involved. I think thats part of it. I think also that the American people want a balanced program that gives us long-term growth so that theyre not having to take money thats desperate to themselves and their families and give it to someone else. Im opposed to that, too.",1984-10-07,Democrat,125,"What do you believe the American public prioritizes when it comes to government spending, and how can we ensure that investments align with their values and needs?"
92,Mr. Mondale,"Mr. President, if I heard you correctly, you said that these deficits dont have anything to do with interest rates. I will grant you that interest rates were too high in 1980, and we can have another debate as to why  energy prices and so on. Theres no way of glossing around that. But when these huge deficits went in place in 1981, whats called the real interest rates  the spread between inflation and what a loan costs you doubled  and thats still the case today. And the result is interest costs that have never been seen before in terms of real charges, and its attributable to the deficit.",1984-10-07,Democrat,109,"Mr. President, can you explain how you believe the current deficits are impacting interest rates and what your administration plans to do about the rising costs associated with them?"
93,Mr. Mondale,"Do you want to give me some suggestions? [Laughter] Im going to use my time a little differently. Im going to give the President some credit. I think the President has done some things to raise the sense of spirit, morale, good feeling in this country, and hes entitled to credit for that. What I think we need, however, is not just that but to move forward, not just congratulating ourselves but challenging ourselves to get on with the business of dealing with Americas problems. I think in education, when he lectured the country about the importance of discipline, I didnt like it at first, but I think it helped a little bit. But now we need both that kind of discipline and the resources and the consistent leadership that allows this country to catch up in education and science and training. I like President Reagan. And this is not personal  there are deep differences about our future, and thats the basis of my campaign.",1984-10-07,Democrat,165,"What are your thoughts on the current administration's contributions to the national spirit and morale, and how do you believe we should build on those contributions to address America's pressing challenges?"
94,Mr. Mondale,"Without any doubt, I have stood up and told the American people that that $263 billion deficit must come down. And Ive done what no candidate for President has ever done, I told you before the election what Id do. Mr. Reagan, as you saw tonight  President Reagan takes the position it will disappear by magic. It was once called voodoo economics. I wish the President would say: Yes, the CBO is right. Yes, we have a $263 billion deficit. This is how Im going to get it done. Dont talk about growth, because even though we need growth, thats not helping. Its going to go in the other direction, as theyve estimated. And give us a plan. What will you cut? Whose taxes will you raise? Will you finally touch that defense budget? Are you going to go after Social Security and Medicare and student assistance and the handicapped again as you did last time? If youd just tell us what youre going to do, then the American people could compare my plan for the future with your plan. And thats the way it should be. The American people would be in charge.",1984-10-07,Democrat,194,"What specific steps do you believe a President should take to address the current budget deficit, and how do you respond to your opponent's plans or lack thereof in this area?"
95,Mr. Mondale,"Well, weve just finished almost the whole debate. And the American people dont have the slightest clue about what President Reagan will do about these deficits. [Laughter] And yet, thats the most important single issue of our time. I did support the 76 measure that he told about, because we were in a deep recession and we needed some stimulation. But I will say as a Democrat, I was a real piker, Mr. President. In 1979 we ran a $29 billion deficit all year. This administration seems to run that every morning. And the result is exactly what we see. This economy is starting to run downhill. Housing is off. Last report on new purchases, its the lowest since 1982. Growth is a little over 3 percent now. Many people are predicting a recession. And the flow of imports into this country is swamping the American people. Weve got to deal with this problem, and those of us who want to be your President should tell you now what were going to do, so you can make a judgment.",1984-10-07,Democrat,179,"What specific plans do you have to address the federal deficit, and how do you believe your approach will differ from the current administration's policies?"
96,Mr. Mondale,"I want to thank the League of Women Voters and the city of Louisville for hosting this evenings debate. I want to thank President Reagan for agreeing to debate. He didnt have to, and he did, and we all appreciate it. The Presidents favorite question is: Are you better off? Well, if youre wealthy, youre better off. If youre middle income, youre about where you were. And if youre modest income, youre worse off. Thats what the economists tell us. But is that really the question that should be asked? Isnt the real question is will we be better off? Will our children be better off? Are we building the future that this nation needs? I believe that if we ask those questions that bear on our future, not just congratulate ourselves but challenge us to solve those problems, youll see that we need new leadership. I would rather lose a campaign about decency than win a campaign about self-interest. I dont think this nation is composed of people who care only for themselves. And when we sought to assault Social Security and Medicare, as the record shows we did, I think that was mean-spirited. When we terminated 400,000 desperate, hopeless, defenseless Americans who were on disability  confused and unable to defend themselves, and just laid them out on the street, as we did for 4 years, I dont think thats what America is all about. America is a fair society, and it is not right that Vice President Bush pays less in taxes than the janitor who helps him. I believe theres fundamental fairness crying out that needs to be achieved in our tax system. I believe that we will be better off if we protect this environment. And contrary to what the President says, I think their record on the environment is inexcusable and often shameful. These laws are not being enforced, have not been enforced, and the public health and the air and the water are paying the price. Thats not fair for our future. I think our future requires a President to lead us in an all-out search to advance our education, our learning, and our science and training, because this world is more complex and were being pressed harder all the time. I believe in opening doors. We won the Olympics, in part, because weve had civil rights laws and the laws that prohibit discrimination against women. I have been for those efforts all my life. The Presidents record is quite different. The question is our future. President Kennedy once said in response to similar arguments, We are great, but we can be greater. We can be better if we face our future, rejoice in our strengths, face our problems, and by solving them, build a better society for our children. Thank you.",1984-10-07,Democrat,468,"What do you see as the most pressing issues facing American families today, and how do you propose to address them to ensure a better future for the next generation?"
97,Mr. Mondale,"I believe that the question oversimplifies the difficulties of what we must do in Central America. Our objectives ought to be to strengthen the democracies, to stop Communist and other extremist influences, and stabilize the community in that area. To do that we need a three-pronged attack: one is military assistance to our friends who are being pressured; secondly, a strong and sophisticated economic aid program and human rights program that offers a better life and a sharper alternative to the alternative offered by the totalitarians who oppose us; and finally, a strong diplomatic effort that pursues the possibilities of peace in the area. This brings up the whole question of what Presidential leadership is all about. I think the lesson in Central America, this recent embarrassment in Nicaragua where we are giving instructions for hired assassins, hiring criminals, and the rest  all of this has strengthened our opponents. A President must not only assure that were tough, but we must also be wise and smart in the exercise of that power. We saw the same thing in Lebanon, where we spent a good deal of Americas assets. But because the leadership of this government did not pursue wise policies, we have been humiliated, and our opponents are stronger. The bottom line of national strength is that the President must be in command, he must lead. And when a President doesnt know that submarine missiles are recallable, says that 70 percent of our strategic forces are conventional, discovers 3 years into his administration that our arms control efforts have failed because he didnt know that most Soviet missiles were on land  these are things a President must know to command. A President is called the Commander in Chief. And hes called that because hes supposed to be in charge of the facts and run our government and strengthen our nation.",1984-10-21,Democrat,310,"What is your strategy for addressing the complex situation in Central America, particularly in relation to democracy, economic aid, and U.S. military involvement?"
98,Mr. Mondale,"We absolutely must, which is why I responded to your first question the way I did. Its much more complex. You must understand the region; you must understand the politics in the area; you must provide a strong alternative; and you must show strength  and all at the same time. Thats why I object to the covert action in Nicaragua. Thats a classic example of a strategy thats embarrassed us, strengthened our opposition, and undermined the moral authority of our people and our country in the region. Strength requires knowledge, command. Weve seen in the Nicaraguan example a policy that has actually hurt us, strengthened our opposition, and undermined the moral authority of our country in that region.",1984-10-21,Democrat,118,"What is your stance on U.S. foreign policy in Central America, particularly regarding military interventions, and how do you believe they impact America's moral authority globally?"
99,Mr. Mondale,"What is a President charged with doing when he takes his oath of office? He raises his right hand and takes an oath of office to take care to faithfully execute the laws of the land. A President cant know everything, but a President has to know those things that are essential to his leadership and the enforcement of our laws. This manual  several thousands of which were produced  was distributed, ordering political assassinations, hiring of criminals, and other forms of terrorism. Some of it was excised, but the part dealing with political terrorism was continued. How can this happen? How can something this serious occur in an administration and have a President of the United States in a situation like this say he didnt know? A President must know these things. I dont know which is worse, not knowing or knowing and not stopping it. And what about the mining of the harbors in Nicaragua which violated international law? This has hurt this country, and a Presidents supposed to command.",1984-10-21,Democrat,171,"What responsibilities does a President have regarding the oversight and enforcement of laws, especially in light of serious actions taken by their administration?"
100,Mr. Mondale,"Because the only type of agreements to reach with the Soviet Union are the types that are specifically defined, so we know exactly what they must do; subject to full verification, which means we know every day whether theyre living up to it; and followups, wherever we find suggestions that theyre violating it; and the strongest possible terms. I have no illusions about the Soviet Union leadership or the nature of that state. They are a tough and a ruthless adversary, and we must be prepared to meet that challenge, and I would. Where I part with the President is that despite all of those differences we must, as past Presidents before this one have done, meet on the common ground of survival. And thats where the President has opposed practically every arms control agreement, by every President, of both political parties, since the bomb went off. And he now completes this term with no progress toward arms control at all, but with a very dangerous arms race underway instead. There are now over 2,000 more warheads pointed at us today than there were when he was sworn in, and that does not strengthen us. We must be very, very realistic in the nature of that leadership, but we must grind away and talk to find ways of reducing these differences, particularly where arms races are concerned and other dangerous exercises of Soviet power. There will be no unilateral disarmament under my administration. I will keep this nation strong. I understand exactly what the Soviets are up to, but that, too, is a part of national strength. To do that, a President must know what is essential to command and to leadership and to strength. And thats where the Presidents failure to master, in my opinion, the essential elements of arms control has cost us dearly. Hes 3 years into this administration. He said he just discovered that most Soviet missiles are on land, and thats why his proposal didnt work. I invite the American people tomorrow  because I will issue the statement quoting President Reagan  he said exactly what I said he said. He said that these missiles were less dangerous than ballistic missiles because you could fire them, and you could recall them if you decided thered been a miscalculation.",1984-10-21,Democrat,382,"What is your stance on arms control agreements with the Soviet Union, and how do you believe your approach would differ from the current administration's policy?"
101,Mr. Mondale,"I think the essential strategy of the United States ought not accept any Soviet control over Eastern Europe. We ought to deal with each of these countries separately. We ought to pursue strategies with each of them, economic and the rest, that help them pull away from their dependence upon the Soviet Union. Where the Soviet Union has acted irresponsibly, as they have in many of those countries, especially, recently, in Poland, I believe we ought to insist that Western credits extended to the Soviet Union bear the market rate. Make the Soviets pay for their irresponsibility. That is a very important objective  to make certain that we continue to look forward to progress toward greater independence by these nations and work with each of them separately.",1984-10-21,Democrat,127,How do you propose the United States should engage with Eastern European countries to reduce their dependence on the Soviet Union?
102,Mr. Mondale,"Mr. President, I accept your commitment to peace, but I want you to accept my commitment to a strong national defense. [Applause] I propose a budget  I have proposed a budget which would increase our nations strength, in real terms, by double that of the Soviet Union. Ill tell you where we disagree. It is true over 10 years ago I voted to delay production of the F  14, and Ill tell you why. The plane wasnt flying the way it was supposed to be; it was a waste of money. Your definition of national strength is to throw money at the Defense Department. My definition of national strength is to make certain that a dollar spent buys us a dollars worth of defense. Theres a big difference between the two of us. A President must manage that budget. I will keep us strong, but youll not do that unless you command that budget and make certain we get the strength that we need. You pay $500 for a $5 hammer, youre not buying strength.",1984-10-21,Democrat,175,"Mr. President, how do you respond to concerns about balancing national defense spending with effective budgeting to ensure taxpayer dollars are used efficiently?"
103,Mr. Mondale,"No. As a matter of fact, I believe every one of those standards is essential to the exercise of power by this country. And we can see that in both Lebanon and in Central America. In Lebanon, this President exercised American power, all right, but the management of it was such that our marines were killed, we had to leave in humiliation, the Soviet Union became stronger, terrorists became emboldened. And it was because they did not think through how power should be exercised, did not have the American public with them on a plan that worked, that we ended up the way we did. Similarly, in Central America: What were doing in Nicaragua with this covert war  which the Congress, including many Republicans, have tried to stop  is finally end up with a public definition of American power that hurts us, where we get associated with political assassins and the rest. We have to decline, for the first time in modern history, jurisdiction in the World Court because theyll find us guilty of illegal actions. And our enemies are strengthened from all of this. We need to be strong, we need to be prepared to use that strength, but we must understand that we are a democracy. We are a government by the people, and when we move, it should be for very severe and extreme reasons that serve our national interests and end up with a stronger country behind us. It is only in that way that we can persevere.",1984-10-21,Democrat,252,What are your thoughts on the importance of maintaining democratic values and public support when exercising American power in international conflicts?
104,Mr. Mondale,"What Im referring to there is the mutual self-defense provisions that exist in the Inter-American treaty, the so-called Rio Pact, that permits the nations, our friends in that region, to combine to take steps  diplomatic and otherwise  to prevent Nicaragua, when she acts irresponsibly in asserting power in other parts outside of her border, to take those steps, whatever they might be, to stop it. The Nicaraguans must know that it is the policy of our government that that leadership must stay behind the boundaries of their nation, not interfere in other nations. And by working with all of the nations in the region  unlike the policies of this administration and unlike the President said, they have not supported negotiations in that region  we will be much stronger, because well have the moral authority that goes with those efforts.",1984-10-21,Democrat,139,"How do you believe the United States should engage with its allies in Latin America to address regional threats, particularly regarding Nicaragua's actions, and what specific agreements or treaties would inform that approach?"
105,Mr. Mondale,"Groucho Marx said, Who do you believe?  me, or your own eyes? And what we have in Lebanon is something that the American people have seen. The Joint Chiefs urged the President not to put our troops in that barracks because they were indefensible. They went to him 5 days before they were killed and said, Please, take them out of there. The Secretary of State admitted that this morning. He did not do so. The report following the explosion of the barracks disclosed that we had not taken any of the steps that we should have taken. That was the second time. Then the Embassy was blown up a few weeks ago, and once again none of the steps that should have been taken were taken. And we were warned 5 days before that explosives were on their way, and they werent taken. The terrorists have won each time. The President told the terrorists he was going to retaliate. He didnt. They called their bluff. And the bottom line is that the United States left in humiliation, and our enemies are stronger.",1984-10-21,Democrat,183,"What lessons do you think we should learn from past military engagements, particularly regarding the decision-making processes and actions taken to protect our troops?"
106,Mr. Mondale,"No. And I have not made it an issue, nor should it be. Whats at issue here is the Presidents application of his authority to understand what a President must know to lead this nation, secure our defense, and make the decisions and the judgments that are necessary. A minute ago the President quoted Cicero, I believe. I want to quote somebody a little closer to home, Harry Truman. He said, The buck stops here. We just heard the Presidents answer for the problems at the barracks in Lebanon, where 241 marines were killed. What happened? First, the Joint Chiefs of Staff went to the President, said, Dont put those troops there. They did it. And then 5 days before the troops were killed, they went back to the President, through the Secretary of Defense, and said, Please, Mr. President, take those troops out of there because we cant defend them. They didnt do it. And we know what happened. After that, once again, our Embassy was exploded. This is the fourth time this has happened  an identical attack, in the same region, despite warnings  even public warnings  from the terrorists. Whos in charge? Whos handling this matter? Thats my main point. Now, on arms control, were completing 4 years. This is the first administration since the bomb went off that made no progress. We have an arms race underway instead. A President has to lead his government or it wont be done. Different people with different views fight with each other. For 3\1/2\ years, this administration avoided arms control, resisted tabling arms control proposals that had any hope of agreeing, rebuked their negotiator in 1981 when he came close to an agreement, at least in principle, on medium-range weapons. And we have this arms race underway. And a recent book that just came out by perhaps the Nations most respected author in this field, Strobe Talbott, called Deadly Gambits, concludes that this President has failed to master the essential details needed to command and lead us, both in terms of security and terms of arms control. Thats why they call the President the Commander in Chief. Good intentions, I grant. But it takes more than that. You must be tough and smart.",1984-10-21,Democrat,373,"What specific responsibilities do you believe a President must fulfill in order to effectively manage national security and arms control, and how has the current administration performed in these areas?"
107,Mr. Mondale,"I read his statement the other day. I dont admire Fidel Castro at all. And Ive said that. Che Guevara was a contemptible figure in civilizations history. I know the Cuban state as a police state, and all my life Ive worked in a way that demonstrates that. But Jesse Jackson is an independent person. I dont control him.

108,Mr. Mondale,"There are two distinguished authors on arms control in this country  there are many others, but two that I want to cite tonight. One is Strobe Talbott in his classic book, Deadly Gambits. The other is John Neuhaus, whos one of the most distinguished arms control specialists in our country. Both said that this administration turned down the walk in the woods agreement first, and that would have been a perfect agreement from the standpoint of the United States in Europe and our security. When Mr. Nitze, a good negotiator, returned, he was rebuked, and his boss was fired. This is the kind of leadership that weve had in this administration on the most deadly issue of our times. Now we have a runaway arms race. All theyve got to show for 4 years in U.S.-Soviet relations is one meeting in the last weeks of an administration, and nothing before. Theyre tough negotiators, but all previous Presidents have made progress. This one has not.",1984-10-21,Democrat,164,"What is your assessment of the current administration's approach to arms control, and how do you respond to claims that it has failed to make significant progress compared to previous administrations?"
109,Mr. Mondale,"This is a very serious problem in our country, and it has to be dealt with. I object to that part of the Simpson-Mazzoli bill which I think is very unfair and would prove to be so. That is the part that requires employers to determine the citizenship of an employee before theyre hired. Im convinced that the result of this would be that people who are Hispanic, people who have different languages or speak with an accent, would find it difficult to be employed. I think thats wrong. Weve never had citizenship tests in our country before, and I dont think we should have a citizenship card today. That is counterproductive. I do support the other aspects of the Simpson-Mazzoli bill that strengthen enforcement at the border, strengthen other ways of dealing with undocumented workers in this difficult area and dealing with the problem of settling people who have lived here for many, many years and do not have an established status. I have further strongly recommended that this administration do something it has not done, and that is to strengthen enforcement at the border, strengthen the officials in this government that deal with undocumented workers, and to do so in a way thats responsible and within the Constitution of the United States. We need an answer to this problem, but it must be an American answer that is consistent with justice and due process. Everyone in this room, practically, here tonight, is an immigrant. We came here loving this nation, serving it, and it has served all of our most bountiful dreams. And one of those dreams is justice. And we need a measure  and I will support a measure  that brings about those objectives but avoids that one aspect that I think is very serious. The second part is to maintain and improve relations with our friends to the south. We cannot solve this problem all on our own. And thats why the failure of this administration to deal in an effective and a good-faith way with Mexico, with Costa Rica, with the other nations in trying to find a peaceful settlement to the dispute in Central America has undermined our capacity to effectively deal diplomatically in this area as well.",1984-10-21,Democrat,374,"What specific provisions of the Simpson-Mazzoli bill do you believe could negatively impact employment opportunities for certain groups, and how would you propose to address the broader immigration challenges facing our nation?"
110,Mr. Mondale,"I think youre right that the polls show that the majority of Hispanics want that bill, so Im not doing it for political reasons. Im doing it because all my life Ive fought for a system of justice in this country, a system in which every American has a chance to achieve the fullness in life without discrimination. This bill imposes upon employers the responsibility of determining whether somebody who applies for a job is an American or not. And just inevitably, theyre going to be reluctant to hire Hispanics or people with a different accent. If I were dealing with politics here, the polls show the American people want this. I am for reform in this area, for tough enforcement at the border, and for many other aspects of the Simpson-Mazzoli bill, but all my life Ive fought for a fair nation. And despite the politics of it, I stand where I stand, and I think Im right, and before this fight is over were going to come up with a better bill, a more effective bill that does not undermine the liberties of our people.",1984-10-21,Democrat,187,"What is your stance on the recent immigration bill that proposes increased employer responsibilities in verifying citizenship, and how do you believe it affects fairness and discrimination in the job market?"
111,Mr. Mondale,"One of the biggest problems today is that the countries to our south are so desperately poor that these people who will almost lose their lives if they dont come north, come north despite all the risks. And if were going to find a permanent, fundamental answer to this, it goes to American economic and trade policies that permit these nations to have a chance to get on their own two feet and to get prosperity, so that they can have jobs for themselves and their people. And thats why this enormous national debt, engineered by this administration, is harming these countries in fueling this immigration. These high interest rates  real rates that have doubled under this administration  have had the same effect on Mexico and so on, and the cost of repaying those debts is so enormous that it results in massive unemployment, hardship, and heartache. And that drives our friends to the south up into our region, and we need to end those deficits as well.",1984-10-21,Democrat,168,"What do you see as the root causes of immigration from countries to our south, and how do you believe U.S. economic and trade policies should be adjusted to address these issues?"
112,Mr. Mondale,"First of all, let me sharply disagree with the President on sharing the most advanced, the most dangerous, the most important technology in America with the Soviet Union. We have had for many years, understandably, a system of restraints on high technology because the Soviets are behind us. And any research or development along the Star Wars schemes would inevitably involve our most advanced computers, our most advanced engineering. And the thought that we would share this with the Soviet Union is, in my opinion, a total non-STARTer. I would not let the Soviet Union get their hands on it at all. Now, whats wrong with Star Wars? Theres nothing wrong with the theory of it. If we could develop a principle that would say both sides could fire all their missiles and no one would get hurt, I suppose its a good idea. But the fact of it is were so far away from research that even comes close to that, that the Director of Engineering Research at the Defense Department said to get there we would have to solve eight problems, each of which are more difficult than the atomic bomb and the Manhattan project. It would cost something like a trillion dollars to test and deploy weapons. The second thing is this all assumes that the Soviets wouldnt respond in kind. And they always do. We dont get behind. They wont get behind. And thats been the tragic story of the arms race. We have more at stake in space satellites than they do. If we could stop, right now, the testing and the deployment of these space weapons  and the Presidents proposals go clear beyond research; if it was just research we wouldnt have any argument, because maybe someday, somebody will think of something  but to commit this nation to a buildup of antisatellite and space weapons at this time, in their crude state, would bring about an arms race thats very dangerous indeed. One final point. The most dangerous aspect of this proposal is, for the first time, we would delegate to computers the decision as to whether to start a war. Thats dead wrong. There wouldnt be time for a President to decide; it would be decided by these remote computers. It might be an oil fire, it might be a jet exhaust, the computer might decide its a missile  and off we go.",1984-10-21,Democrat,400,"How do you respond to the administration's proposals for advanced space-based weaponry, particularly regarding the potential risks of sharing technology with adversaries and the implications for global security?"
113,Mr. Mondale,Every system that is verifiable should be placed on the table for negotiations for an agreement. I would not agree to any negotiations or any agreement that involved conduct on the part of the Soviet Union that we couldnt verify every day. I would not agree to any agreement in which the United States security interest was not fully recognized and supported. Thats why we say mutual and verifiable freezes.,1984-10-21,Democrat,70,"What is your stance on the importance of verification in international agreements, particularly in relation to negotiations with nations that have had a history of non-compliance?"
114,Mr. Mondale,  and the people of the Soviet Union want it to stop.,1984-10-21,Democrat,11,"What is your stance on the current tensions between the United States and Russia, and how do you believe we should address the desires of the Russian populace for peace?"
115,Mr. Mondale,"Well, thats what a Presidents supposed to know  where those weapons are going to be. If theyre space weapons, I assume theyll be in space. [Laughter] If theyre antisatellite weapons, I assume theyre going to be aimed against satellites. Now, this is the most dangerous technology that we possess. The Soviets try to spy on us, steal this stuff. And to give them technology of this kind, I disagree with. You havent just accepted research, Mr. President. Youve set up a Strategic Defense Initiative, an agency, youre beginning to test, youre talking about deploying, youre asking for a budget of some $30 billion for this purpose. This is an arms escalation. And we will be better off, far better off, if we stop right now, because we have more to lose in space then they do. If someday, somebody comes along with an answer, thats something else. But that there would be an answer in our lifetime is unimaginable. Why do we start things that we know the Soviets will match and make us all less secure? Thats what a Presidents for.",1984-10-21,Democrat,182,"What is your stance on the current U.S. approach to space weapons and the Strategic Defense Initiative, and how do you believe it impacts national security and international relations, particularly with adversaries like the Soviet Union?"
116,Mr. Mondale,"No. As a matter of fact, we have a vast range of technology and weaponry right now that provides all the bargaining chips that we need. And I support the air launch cruise missile, the ground launch cruise missile, the Pershing missile, the Trident submarine, the D  5 submarine, Stealth technology, the Midgetman  we have a whole range of technology. Why I disagree with the MX is that its a sitting duck. Itll draw an attack. It puts a hair-trigger, and it is a dangerous, destabilizing weapon. And the B  1 is similarly to be opposed, because for 15 years the Soviet Union has been preparing to meet the B  1. The Secretary of Defense himself said it would be a suicide mission if it were built. Instead, I want to build the Midgetman, which is mobile and thus less vulnerable, contributing to stability, and a weapon that will give us security and contribute to an incentive for arms control. Thats why Im for Stealth technology, to build a Stealth bomber  which Ive supported for years  that can penetrate the Soviet air defense system without any hope that they can perceive where it is because their radar system is frustrated. In other words, a President has to make choices. This makes us stronger. The final point is that we can use this money that we save on these weapons to spend on things that we really need. Our conventional strength in Europe is under strength. We need to strengthen that in order to assure our Western allies of our presence there, a strong defense, but also to diminish and reduce the likelihood of a commencement of a war and the use of nuclear weapons. Its in this way, by making wise choices, that were stronger, we enhance the chances of arms control. Every President until this one has been able to do it, and this nation  or the world is more dangerous as a result.",1984-10-21,Democrat,325,What specific military technologies and strategies do you believe are essential for ensuring national security and promoting arms control in today’s geopolitical landscape?
117,Mr. Mondale,"I will not agree to any arms control agreement, including a freeze, thats not verifiable. Lets take your warhead principle. The warhead principle  there have been counting rules for years. Whenever a weapon is tested we count the number of warheads on it, and whenever that warhead is used we count that number of warheads, whether they have that number or less on it, or not. These are standard rules. I will not agree to any production restrictions  or agreements, unless we have the ability to verify those agreements. I dont trust the Russians. I believe that every agreement we reach must be verifiable, and I will not agree to anything that we cannot tell every day. In other words, weve got to be tough. But in order to stop this arms madness, weve got to push ahead with tough negotiations that are verifiable so that we know the Soviets are agreeing and living up to their agreement.",1984-10-21,Democrat,158,"What is your stance on arms control agreements, and how do you propose ensuring that any agreements made are verifiable and accountable?"
118,Mr. Mondale,"Perhaps in no area do we disagree more than this administrations policies on human rights. I went to the Philippines as Vice President, pressed for human rights, called for the release of Aquino, and made progress that had been stalled on both the Subic and the Clark airfield bases. What explains this administration cozying up to the Argentine dictators after they took over? Fortunately, a democracy took over, but this nation was embarrassed by this current administrations adoption of their policies. What happens in South Africa, where, for example, the Nobel Prize winner, 2 days ago, said this administration is seen as working with the oppressive government of South Africa. That hurts this nation. We need to stand for human rights. We need to make it clear were for human liberty. National security and human rights must go together. But this administration time and time again has lost its way in this field.",1984-10-21,Democrat,153,"What are your views on the current administration's approach to international human rights issues, particularly in relation to its dealings with authoritarian regimes?"
119,Mr. Mondale,"I believe in a sensible arms control approach that brings down these weapons to manageable levels. I would like to see their elimination. And in the meantime, we have to be strong enough to make certain that the Soviet Union never tempts us. Now, here we have to decide between generalized objectives and reality. The President says he wants to eliminate or reduce the number of nuclear weapons. But, in fact, these last 4 years have seen more weapons built, a wider and more vigorous arms race than in human history. He says he wants a system that will make nuclear wars safe, so nobodys going to get hurt. Well, maybe someday, somebody can dream of that.",1984-10-21,Democrat,117,"What is your stance on nuclear arms control, and how do you propose to balance the goal of disarmament with the realities of the current arms race?"
120,Mr. Mondale,"I want to thank the League of Women Voters, the good citizens of Kansas City, and President Reagan for agreeing to debate this evening. This evening we talked about national strength. I believe we need to be strong, and I will keep us strong. But I think strength must also require wisdom and smarts in its exercise. Thats key to the strength of our nation. A President must know the essential facts essential to command. But a President must also have a vision of where this nation should go. Tonight, as Americans, you have a choice. And youre entitled to know where we would take this country if you decide to elect us. As President, I would press for long-term, vigorous economic growth. Thats why I want to get these debts down and these interest rates down, restore Americas exports, help rural America, which is suffering so much, and bring the jobs back here for our children. I want this next generation to be the best educated in American history, to invest in the human mind and science again, so were out front. I want this nation to protect its air, its water, its land, and its public health. America is not temporary; were forever. And as Americans, our generation should protect this wonderful land for our children. I want a nation of fairness, where no one is denied the fullness of life or discriminated against, and we deal compassionately with those in our midst who are in trouble. And, above all, I want a nation thats strong. Since we debated 2 weeks ago, the United States and the Soviet Union have built a hundred more warheads, enough to kill millions of Americans and millions of Soviet citizens. This doesnt strengthen us. This weakens the chances of civilization to survive. I remember the night before I became Vice President. I was given the briefing and told that any time, night or day, I might be called upon to make the most fateful decision on Earth  whether to fire these atomic weapons that could destroy the human species. That lesson tells us two things: One, pick a President that you know will know if that tragic moment ever comes what he must know, because therell be no time for staffing committees or advisers. A President must know right then. But above all, pick a President who will fight to avoid the day when that God-awful decision ever needs to be made. And thats why this election is so terribly important. America and Americans decide not just whats happening in this country. We are the strongest and most powerful free society on Earth. When you make that judgment, you are deciding not only the future of our nation; in a very profound respect, youre deciding the future of the world. We need to move on. Its time for America to find new leadership. Please, join me in this cause to move confidently and with a sense of assurance and command to build the blessed future of our nation.",1984-10-21,Democrat,506,What are the key qualities and actions you believe a President must embody and undertake to ensure the national strength and security of the United States while also fostering a hopeful future for its citizens?
121,Mr. Carter,"Well I might say first of all that I think in case of the Carter administration the sacrifices would be much less. Mr. Fords own uh  environmental agency has projected a 10 percent unemployment rate by 1978 if hes uh  president. The American people are ready to make sacrifices if they are part of the process. If they know that they will be helping to make decisions and wont be excluded from being an involved party to the national purpose. The major effort we must put forward is to put our people back to work. And I think that this uh  is one example where uh  a lot of people have selfish, grasping ideas now. I remember 1973 in the depth of the uh  energy crisis when President Nixon called on the American people to make a sacrifice, to cut down on the waste of uh  gasoline, to cut down on the uh  speed of automobiles. It was a  a tremendous surge of patriotism, that I want to make a sacrifice for my country. I think we uh  could call together, with strong leadership in the White House, business, industry and labor, and say lets have voluntary price restraints. Lets lay down some guidelines so we dont have continuing inflation. We can also have a- an end to the extremes. We now have one extreme for instance, of some welfare recipients, who by taking advantage of the welfare laws, the housing laws, the uh  Medicaid uh  laws, and the uh  food stamp laws, make over $10 thousand a year and uh  they dont have to pay any taxes on it. At the other extreme, uh  just 1 percent of the richest people in our country derive 25 percent of all the tax benefits. So both those extremes grasp for advantage and the person who has to pay that expense is the middle-income family whos still working for a living and they have to pay for the rich who have privilege, and for the poor who are not working. But I think uh  uh  a balanced approach, with everybody being part of it and a striving for unselfishness, could help as it did in 1973 to let people sacrifice for their own country. I know Im ready for it. I think the American people are too.",1976-10-22,Democrat,385,"What specific sacrifices do you believe the American people would be willing to make in order to address current economic challenges, and how can leadership encourage a spirit of unity and shared purpose in this effort?"
122,Mr. Carter,"I think the major reason for a decrease in participation that we have experienced ever since 1960 has been the deep discouragement of the American people about the performance of public officials. When youve got seven and a half, eight million people out of work, and youve got three times as much inflation as you had during the last eight-year Democratic administration, when you have the highest deficits in history; when you have it uh  becoming increasingly difficult far a family to put a child through college or to own a home, theres a natural inclination to be turned off. Also, in the aftermath of Vietnam and Cambodia and uh  Watergate and uh  the CIA revelations, people have feel  have felt that theyve uh been betrayed by public officials, I have to admit that in the uh  heat of the campaign  Ive been in thirty primaries during the springtime, Ive been campaigning for twenty-two months  Ive made some mistakes. And I think this is uh  uh  part of uh  of just being a human being. I  I have to say that my campaign has been an open one. And uh  the Playboy thing has been of great  very great concern to me. I dont know how to deal with it exactly. Uh  I uh  agreed to give the interview uh  to Playboy Other people have done it who are notable  uh  Governor Jerry Brown, uh  Walter Cronkite, uh  Albert Schweitzer, Mr. Fords own secretary of the treasury, Mr. Simon, uh  William Buckley  many other people. But they werent running for president, and in retrospect, from hindsight, I would not have given that uh  interview had I do it  had it  I to do it over again. If I should ever decide in the future to discuss my  my deep Christian beliefs and uh  condemnation and sinfulness, Ill use another forum besides Playboy. But I can say this, uh  Im doing the best I can to get away from that, and during the next ten days, the American people will not see the Carter campaign running uh  television advertisements and newspaper advertisements based on a personal attack on President Fords character. I believe that the opposite is true with President Fords campaign, and uh  I hope that we can leave those issues in this next ten days about personalities and mistakes of the past  weve both made some mistakes  and talk about unemployment, inflation, housing, education, taxation, government organization, stripping away of secrecy, and the things that are crucial to the American people. I regret the things in my own long campaign that have been mistaken, but Im trying to do away with those the last ten days.",1976-10-22,Democrat,447,"What do you believe has contributed to the decline in voter participation over the years, and how do you plan to address the concerns of the American people as a candidate?"
123,Mr. Carter,"In the last uh  two weeks, Ive had a chance to talk to uh  two men who have visited uh  the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia and China. One is Governor Avell- Averell Harriman, who visited the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia, and the other is James Schlesinger, whom I think you accompanied to uh  China. I got a- a complete report back from those countries from these two distinguished  uh  gentlemen. Mr. Harriman talked to the leaders in Yugoslavia, and I think its accurate to say that there is no uh  prospect in their opinion, of the Soviet Union invading uh  Yugoslavia should uh  Mr. Tito pass away. The present leadership uh  there is uh  is fairly uniform in  in their purpose, and I think its a close-knit group, uh  and uh  I think it would be unwise for us to say that we will go to war uh  in Yugoslavia uh  if the Soviets should invade, which I think would be an extremely unlikely thing. I have maintained from the very beginning of my campaign, and this was a standard answer that I made in response to the Yugoslavian question, that I would never uh  go to war or become militarily involved, in the internal affairs of another country unless our own security was direc- rectly threatened. And uh  I dont believe that our security would be directly threatened if the Soviet Union went uh  into Yugoslavia. I dont believe it will happen. I certainly hope it wont. I would take eh  the strongest possible measures short of uh  actual military uh  action there by our own troops, but I doubt that that would be an eventuality.",1976-10-22,Democrat,276,"What is your stance on the potential for military intervention in regions influenced by the Soviet Union, such as Yugoslavia, and how do you assess the current geopolitical landscape regarding such actions?"
124,Mr. Carter,"Well, just briefly, I  I think this is uh  the second time that General Brown has made a statement that  for which he did have to apologize. And I know that everybody uh  makes mistakes. I think the first one was related to uh  the unwarranted influence of American Jews on the media and uh  in the Congress. This one concerned uh  Great Britain. I think he said that Israel was a  a military burden on us and that Iran hoped to reestablish the Persian Empire. Ah  Im not uh  sure that I remembered earlier that President Ford had  had expressed uh  his concern about the statement or apologized for it. This is uh  something, though, that I think uh  is indicative of the need among the American people to know how its commander-in-chief, the president, feels and  and  and I think the only criticism that I would have uh  on  of Mr. Ford is that uh  immediately when the statement was re  re  revealed, uh  perhaps a  a statement from the president would have been a clarifying and a very beneficial thing.",1976-10-22,Democrat,183,"What are your thoughts on the accountability of military leaders for their public statements and the impact those statements can have on international relations, particularly in sensitive areas like the Middle East?"
125,Mr. Carter,"I dont believe it does. Uh  I began campaigning uh  twenty-two months ago. At that time, nobody thought I had a chance to win. Uh  very few people knew who I was. I came from a tiny town, as you know, Plains, and didnt hold public office, didnt have very much money. And my first organization was just four or five people plus my wife and my children, my three sons and their wives. And we won the nomination by going out into the streets  barbershops, beauty parlors, restaurants, stores, in factory shift lines also in farmers markets and livestock sale barns  and we talked a lot and we listened a lot and we learned from the American people. And we built up uh  an awareness among the uh  voters of this country, particularly those in whose primaries I entered  thirty of them, nobodys ever done that before  about who I was and what I stood for. Now we have a very, very wide-ranging group of advisers who help me prepare for these debates and who teach me about international economics, and foreign affairs, defense matters, health, education, welfare, government reorganization. Id say, several hundred of them. And theyre very fine and very highly qualified. The one major decision that I have made since acquiring the nomination, and I share this with President Ford, is the choice of a vice president. I think this should be indicative of the kind of leaders I would choose to help me if I am elected. I chose Senator Walter Mondale. And the only criterion I ever put forward in my own mind was who among the several million people in this country would be the best person qualified to be president, if something should happen to me and to join me in being vice president if I should serve out my term. And Im convinced now, more than I was when I got the nomination, that Walter Mondale was the right choice, And I believe this is a good indication of the kind of people I would choose in the future. Mr. Ford has had that same choice to make. I dont want to say anything critical of Senator Dole, but Ive never heard Mr. Ford say that that was his prim- primary consideration  Who is the best person I could choose in this country to be president of the United States? I feel completely at ease knowing that someday Senator Mondale might very well be president. In the last five pres- vice presidential uh  nominees, uh  incumbents, three of them have become president. But I think this is indicative of what I would do.",1976-10-22,Democrat,442,"What criteria did you use to select your vice presidential running mate, and how does that choice reflect the kind of leadership you would bring to the presidency?"
126,Mr. Carter,"Well, I might say that I think the League of Conservation Voters is absolutely right. This uh  administrations record on environment is very bad. Uh  I think its accurate to say that the uh  strip-mining law which was passed twice by the Congress  uh  and was only like two votes I believe of being overridden  would have been good for the country. The claim that it would have put hundred and forty thousand miners out of work is uh  hard to believe, when at the time Mr. Ford vetoed it, the United Mine Workers was uh  supporting the bill. And I dont think they would have supported the uh  bill had they known that they would lose a hundred and forty thousand jobs. Theres been a consistent policy on the part of this administration to lower or delay enforcement of air pollution standards and water pollution standards. And under both President Nixon and Ford, monies have been impounded that wouldve gone to uh  cities and others to control uh  water pollution. We have no energy policy. We, I think, are the only developed nation in the world that has no comprehensive energy policy, to permit us to plan in an orderly way how to shift from increasing the scarce uh  energy uh  forms: oil, and have research and development concentrated on the increased use of coal, which I strongly favor. The research and development to be used primary to make the coal burning uh  be clean. We need a heritage trust program, similar to the one we had in Georgia, to set aside additional lands that have uh  geological and archeological importance, uh natural areas for enjoyment. Uh  the lands that Mr. Ford uh  brags about having approved are in Alaska and they are enormous in uh  in size. But as far as the accessibility of them by the American people, its very uh  far in the future. Weve taken no strong position in the uh  control of pollution of our oceans, and I would say the worst uh  threat to the environment of all is nuclear proliferation. And this administration, having been in office now for two years or more, has still not taken strong and bold action to stop the proliferation of nuclear waste around the world, particularly plutonium. Those are some brief remarks about the failures of this administration. I would do the opposite in every respect.",1976-10-22,Democrat,400,"In your view, what are the most significant failures of the current administration regarding environmental policy, and how would your approach differ?"
127,Mr. Carter,"Yes, Id be glad to. In the first place, uh  as is the case with the environmental policy and the energy policy that I just described, and the policy for nonproliferation of uh  of nuclear waste, this administration has no urban policy. Its impossible for mayors or governors to cooperate with the resident, because they cant anticipate whats gonna happen next. A mayor of a city like New York, for instance, needs to know uh  eighteen months or two years ahead of time what responsibility the city will have in administration and in financing  in things like housing, uh  pollution control, uh  crime control, education, welfare and health. This has not been done, unfortunately. I remember the headline in the Daily News that said, Ford to New York: Drop Dead. I think its very important that our cities know that they have a partner in the federal government. Quite often Congress has passed laws in the past designed to help people with uh  the ownership of homes and with the control of crime and with adequate health care and education programs and so forth. Uh  those uh programs were designed to help those who need it most. And quite often this has been in the very poor people and neighborhoods in the downtown urban centers. Because of the uh  great -ly- greatly uh  advantaged uh  tho- per  persons who live in the suburbs, better education, better organization, more articulate, more aware of what the laws are, quite often this money has been channeled out of the downtown centers where its needed. Also I favor all revenue sharing money being used for local governments, and also to remove prohibitions in the use of revenue sharing money so that it can be used to improve education, and health care. We have now uh  for instance only 7 percent of the total education cost being financed by the federal government. When uh  the Nixon-Ford Administration started, this was 10 percent. Thats a 30 percent reduction in the portion that the federal government contributes to education in just eight years. And as you know, the education cost has gone up uh  tremendously. The last point is that the major  uh thrust has gotta be to put people back to work. Weve got an extraordinarily high unemployment rate among downtown urban ghetto areas, uh  particularly among the very poor and particularly among minority groups, sometimes 50 or 60 percent. And the concentration of employment opportunities in those areas would help greatly not only to reestablish the tax base, but also to help reduce the extraordinary welfare cost. One of the major responsibilities on the shoulders of uh  New York City is to  is to finance welfare. And I favor a shifting of the welfare cost away from the local governments altogether. And over a longer period of time, let the federal government begin to absorb part of it thats now paid by the state governments. Those things would help a great deal with the cities, but we still have a  a very serious problem there.",1976-10-22,Democrat,510,"What specific steps do you believe the federal government should take to improve urban policy and support cities in addressing issues like housing, education, and unemployment?"
128,Mr. Carter,"The uh  description just made of this administrations record is hard to uh  recognize. I think its accurate to say that Mr. Ford voted against the uh  Voting Rights Acts and the uh  Civil Rights Acts in their uh  debative stage I think once it was assured they were going to pass he finally voted for it. This country uh  changed drastically in 1969 when the uh  terms of John Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson were over and Richard Nixon and  and Gerald Ford became the presidents. There was a time when there was hope for those who uh  were poor and downtrodden and who were  uh elderly or who were  uh ill or who were in minority groups, but that time has been gone. I think the greatest thing that ever happened to the South was the passage of the Civil Rights Act and the opening up of opportunities  uh to black people  the chance to vote, to hold a job, to buy a house, to go to school, and to participate in public affairs. It not only liberated  uh black people but it also liberated the whites. Weve seen uh  in many instances in recent years a minority affairs uh  section of uh Small Loan Administration, uh  Small Business Administration lend uh  a black entrepreneur just enough money to get started, and then to go bankrupt. The bankruptcies have gone up  uh in an extraordinary degree. Uh  FHA, which used to be a very responsible agency, uh  that everyone looked to to help own a home, lost six million dollars last year. Thereve been over thirteen hundred indictments in HUD, over eight hundred convictions relating just to home loans. And now the federal government has become the worlds greatest slum landlord. Weve got a 30 percent or 40 percent unemployment rate among minority uh  young people. And theres been no concerted effort given to the needs of those who are both poor and black, or poor and who speak a foreign language. And thats where theres been a great uh generation of despair, and ill health, and the lack of education, lack of purposefulness, and the lack of hope for the future. But it doesnt take just a quiet uh  dormant uh minimum enforcement of the law. It requires an aggressive searching out and reaching out to help people who especially need it. And thats been lacking in the last eight years.",1976-10-22,Democrat,403,How do you assess the impact of the previous administration's policies on civil rights and economic opportunities for minority communities in the United States?
129,Mr. Carter,"I would not work hard to support any of those. Uh  weve always had, I think, a lot of constitutional amendments proposed, but the passage of them has been uh  fairly slow, and uh  few and far between. In the two-hundred-year history theres been a very uh  cautious approach to this. We  quite often we have a transient problem. I  Im strongly against a- abortion. I think abortions wrong. I dont think the government oughta do anything to encourage abortion. But I dont favor a constitutional amendment on the subject. But short of the constitutional amendment, and within the confines of the Supreme Court rulings, Ill do everything I can to minimize the need for abortions with better sex education, family planning, with better adoptive procedures. I personally dont believe that the federal government oughta finance abortions, but I  I draw the line and dont support a constitutional amendment. However, I honor the right of people who seek the constitutional amendments on school busing, on uh  prayer in the schools and an abortion. But among those you named, I wont actively work for the passage of any of them.",1976-10-22,Democrat,189,"What is your stance on the proposed constitutional amendments related to social issues such as abortion, school busing, and prayer in schools, and how do you believe we should approach these sensitive topics?"
130,Mr. Carter,"I  I think its accurate to say that Mr. Fords position on gun control has changed. Uh  earlier, uh  Mr. Levi, his uh  attorney general, put forward a gun control proposal, which Mr. Ford later, I believe, espoused, that called for the prohibition against the uh sale aw- of the uh  so-called Saturday Night Specials. And it wouldve put uh  very strict uh  uh  control over who owned a handgun. I have been a hunter all my life and happen to own both shotguns, rifles, and a handgun. And uh  the only purpose that I would see in registering uh  handguns and not long guns of any kind would be to prohibit the uh  ownership of those guns by those whove used them in the commission of a crime, or who uh  have been proven to be mentally incompetent to own a gun. I believe that limited approach to the  to the question would be uh  advisable, and  and I think, adequate. But thats as far as I would go with it.",1976-10-22,Democrat,172,"How do you evaluate the shifting positions on gun control among political leaders, and what specific measures do you believe are necessary to ensure responsible gun ownership while addressing public safety concerns?"
131,Mr. Carter,"While I was governor of Georgia, although Im not a lawyer, we had complete reform of the Georgia court system. We uh  streamlined the structure of the court, put in administrative officers, put a unified court system in, required that all uh  severe sentences be reviewed far uniformity. And, in addition to that put forward a proposal that was adopted and used throughout my own term of office of selection of  for all judges and district attorneys or prosecuting attorneys, on the basis of merit. Every time I had a vacancy on the Georgia Supreme Court  and I filled five of those vacancies out of seven total and about half the court of appeals judges, about 35 percent of the trial judges  I was given from an objective panel the five most highly qualified persons in Georgia. And from those five, I always chose the first one or second one. So merit selection of judges is the most important single criterion. And I would institute the same kind of procedure as president, not only in judicial appointments, but also in diplomatic appointments. Secondly, I think that the Burger Court has fairly well confirmed the major and  and most far-reaching and most controversial decisions of the Warren Court. Civil rights  uh has been confirmed by the Burger Court, hasnt been uh  reversed, and I dont think theres any inclination to reverse those basic decisions. The one-man, one-vote rule, which is a very important one that uh  s- struck down the unwarranted influence in the legislature of parsley  uh populated areas of  of the states. The uh  right of indigent or very poor accused persons to uh  legal counsel. Uh  I think the Burger Court has confirmed that basic and very controversial decision of the Warren Court. Also the  the protection of an arrested person against unwarranted persecution in trying to get a false uh  confession. But now I think there have been a couple of instances where the Burger Court has made technical rulings where an obviously guilty person was later found to be guilty. And I think that in that case uh  some of the more liberal uh  members of the uh  so-called Warren Court agreed with those decisions. But the only uh  thing I uh  have pointed out was, what Ive just said, and that there was a need to clarify the technicalities so that you couldnt be forced to release a person who was obviously guilty just because of a  of a small technicality in the law. And  and thats a reversal of position uh by the Burger Court with which I do agree.",1976-10-22,Democrat,436,"What specific reforms did you implement in the judicial system during your time as governor, and how do you believe those experiences would influence your approach to judicial appointments if elected president?"
132,Mr. Carter,"Okay, I thought I answered it by saying that it would be on the basis of merit. Once the uh  search and analysis procedure had been completed, and once Im given a list of the five or seven or ten uh  best qualified persons in the country, I would make a selection from among those uh  persons. If the uh  list was, uh  in my opinion, fairly uniform, if there was no outstanding person, then I would undoubtedly choose someone who would most accurately reflect my own basic politi- political philosophy as best I could determine it. Which would be uh  to continue the progress that has been made under the last two uh  courts  the Warren Court and the Burger Court. I would also like to uh  completely revise our criminal justice system  to do some of the things at the federal level in court reform that Ive just described, as has been done in Georgia and other states. And then I would like to appoint people who would be interested in helping with that. I know that uh Chief Justice Burger is. He hasnt had help from the administration, from the Congress, to carry this out. The uh  emphasis, I think, of the  of the court system uh  should be to interpret the uh  the Constitution and the laws uh  equally between property protection and personal protection. But when theres uh  a very narrow decision  which quite often theres one that reaches the Supreme Court  I think the choice should be with human rights. And uh  that would be another factor that I would follow.",1976-10-22,Democrat,267,"What criteria will you use to select candidates for the Supreme Court, and how will those choices reflect your judicial philosophy?"
133,Mr. Carter,"With all due respect to President Ford, I think he ought to be ashamed of mentioning that statement, because we have the highest unemployment rate now than we had at any time between the Great Depression caused by Herbert Hoover and the time President Ford took office. Weve got seven and a half million people out of jobs. Since hes been in office, two and a half million more American people have lost their jobs. In the last four months alone, five hundred thousand Americans have gone on the unemployment roll. In the last month, weve had a net loss of one hundred and sixty-three thousand jobs. Anybody who says that the inflation rate is in good shape now ought to talk to the housewives. One of the overwhelming results that Ive seen in the polls is that people feel that you cant plan anymore. Theres no way to make a prediction that my family might be able to own a home or to put my kid through college. Savings accounts are losing money instead of gaining money. Inflation is robbing us. Under the present administration  Nixons and Fords  weve had three times the inflation rate that we experienced under President Johnson and President Kennedy. The economic growth is less than half today what it was at the beginning of this year. And housing starts  he compares the housing starts with last year. I dont blame him, because in 1975 we had fewer housing starts in this country, fewer homes built, than any year since 1940. Thats thirty-five years. And weve got a 35 percent unemployment rate in many areas of this country among construction workers. And Mr. Ford hasnt done anything about it. And I think this shows a callous indifference to the families that have suffered so much. He has vetoed bills passed by Congress within the congressional budget guidelines job opportunities for two million Americans. Well never have a balanced budget, well never meet the needs of our people, well never control the inflationary spiral, as long as we have seven and a half or eight million people out of work, who are looking for jobs. And weve probably got two and a half more million people who are not looking for jobs any more, because theyve given up hope. That is a very serious indictment of this administration. Its probably the worst one of all.",1976-10-22,Democrat,399,"What is your assessment of the current administration's handling of unemployment and inflation, and how do you believe it has affected American families?"
134,Mr. Carter,"Well, thats not exactly an accurate description of what happened. When I was that far ahead, it was immediately following the Democratic Convention, and before the Republican Convention. At that time, uh  25 or 30 percent of the Reagan supporters said that they would not support President Ford. But as occurred at the end of the con- Democratic Convention, the Republican Party unified itself. And I think immediately following the Republican Convention, there was about a ten-point spread. I believe that to be accurate, I had 49 percent; President Ford, 39 percent. Uh  the polls uh  are good indications of fluctuations, but they vary widely one from another. And the only poll Ive ever followed is the one that uh  you know, is taken on election day. I was in uh  thirty primaries in the spring, and uh  at first it was obvious that I didnt have any standing in the poll. As a matter of fact, I think when Gallup ran their first poll in December of 1975 they didnt put my name on the list. They had thirty-five people on the list. My name wasnt even there. And at the beginning of the year I had about 2 percent. So the polls to me are interesting, but they dont determine, you know, my hopes or  or my despair. I campaign among people. Ive never depended on powerful political figures to put me in office. I have a direct relationship with hundreds of people around  hundreds of thousands around the country who actively campaign for me. In Georgia alone, for instance, I got 84 percent of the vote, and I think there were fourteen people uh  in addition to myself on the ballot, and Governor Wallace had been very strong in Georgia. Thats an overwhelming support from my own people who know me best. And today, we have about five hundred Georgians at their own expense  just working people who believe in me  spread around the country uh  involved in the political campaign. So, the polls are interesting, but uh  I dont know how to explain the fluctuation. I think a lot of it uh  depends on current events  uh  sometimes foreign affairs, sometimes domestic affairs. But I think our hold uh  of support among those who uh  are crucial to the election has been fairly steady. And my success in the primary season was, I think, notable for a newcomer, from someone whos from outside Washington, who  who never has been a part of the Washington establishment. And I think that well have good results uh  on November the second for myself and I hope for the country.",1976-10-22,Democrat,440,How do you view the reliability of polls in your campaign compared to the on-the-ground support you've experienced from your constituents?
135,Mr. Carter,"Thank you Barbara (barely audible). The major purpose of an election for president is to choose a leader. Someone who can analyze the depths of feeling in our country to set a standard for our people to follow, to inspire our people to reach for greatness, to correct our defects, to answer difficult questions, to bind ourselves together in a spirit of unity. I dont believe the present administration has done that. We have been discouraged and weve been alienated. Sometimes weve been embarrassed and sometimes weve been ashamed. Our people are out of work, and theres a sense of withdrawal. But our country is innately very strong. Mr. Ford is a good and decent man, but hes in  been in office now more than eight hundred days approaching almost as long as John Kennedy was in office. Id like to ask the American people what, whats been accomplished. A lot remains to be done. My own background is different from his. I was a school board member, and a library board member. I served an a hospital authority. And I was in the state senate and I was governor and Im an engineer, a Naval officer, a farmer, a businessman. And I believe we require someone who can work harmoniously with the Congress, who can work closely with the people of this country, and who can bring a new image and a new spirit to Washington. Our tax structure is a disgrace, it needs to be reformed. I was Governor of Georgia for four years. We never increased sales taxes or income tax or property tax. As a matter of fact, the year before I went out of office we gave a $50 million refund to the property taxpayers of Georgia. We spend six hundred dollars per person in this country  every man, woman and child  for health care. We still rank fifteenth among all the nations of the world in infant mortality. And our cancer rate is uh  higher than any country in the world. We dont have good health care. We could have it. Employment ought to be restored to our people. Weve become almost a welfare state. We spend now 700 percent more on unemployment compensation than we did eight years ago when the Republicans took over the White House. Our people wanna go back to work. Our education system can be improved. Secrecy ought to be stripped away from government and a maximum of personal privacy ought to be maintained. Our housing programs have uh  gone bad. It used to be that the average  uh family could own a house. But now less than a third of our people can afford to buy their own homes. The budget was more grossly out of balance last year than ever before in the history of our country  $65 billion  primarily because our people are not at work. Inflation is robbing us, as weve already discussed, and the government bureaucracy is uh  just a horrible mess. This doesnt have to be. Now I dont know all the answers. Nobody could. But I do know that if the president of the United States and the Congress of the United States and the people of the United States said, I believe our nation is greater than what we are now. I believe that if we are inspired, if we can achieve a degree of unity, if we can set our goals high enough and work toward recognized goals with industry and labor and agriculture along with government at all levels, then we can achieve great things. We might have to do it slowly. There are no magic answers to do it. But I believe together we can make great progress. We can correct our difficult mistakes and answer those very tough questions. I believe in the greatness of our country, and I believe the American people are ready for a change in Washington. Weve been drifting too long. Weve been dormant too long. Weve been discouraged too long. And we have not set an example for our own people. But I believe that we can now establish in the White House a good relationship with Congress, a good relationship with our people, set very high goals for our country. And with inspiration and hard work we can achieve great things. And let the world know  thats very important. But more importantly, let the people in our own country realize that we still live in the greatest nation on earth. Thank you very much.",1976-10-22,Democrat,753,"What do you believe is the primary role of a president in addressing the challenges currently facing our nation, and how would you approach fostering unity and progress?"
136,Mr. Carter,"Yes. First of all is to recognize a tremendous economic strength in this country and to set the putting to  back to work of our people as a top priority. This is uh  an effort that ought to be done primarily by strong leadership in the White House, the inspiration of our people, the tapping of uh  business, agriculture, industry, labor and government at all levels to work on this uh project. Well never have uh  an end to the inflationary spiral, and well never have a balanced budget until we get our people back to work. There are several things that can be done specifically that are not now being done. First of all, to channel research and development funds into areas that will provide uh large numbers of jobs. Secondly, we need to have a commitment in the uh private sector uh  to cooperate with government in matters like housing. Here a very small investment of taxpayers money  in the housing field can bring large numbers of extra jobs, and the guarantee of mortgage loans, and the uh  putting forward of uh  two-0-two programs for housing for older people and so forth to cut down the roughly 20 percent unemployment that now exists in the  in the construction industry. Another thing is to deal with our  uh needs in the central cities, where the unemployment rate is extremely high: sometimes among minority groups, or those who dont speak English, or whore black, or young people, or  40 percent of the employment. Here a CCC type program would be appropriate to channel money into the ah  cha- in  in into the sharing with the private sector and also local and state governments to employ young people who are now out of work. Another very important  uh aspect of our  uh economy would be to increase production in every way possible, uh to hold down  uh taxes on individuals, and to uh shift the tax burdens onto those who have avoided paying taxes in the past. These uh  kinds of specific things, uh none of which are being done now, would be a great help in  in reducing uh unemployment. There is uh  uh an additional factor that needs to be done and covered very  very succinctly, and that is, to make sure that we have a good relationship between management  business on the one hand, and labor, on the other. In a > Transfer interrupted! ery high, we might channel specific uh targeted job  job  uh opportunities by paying part of the salary of unemployed people  uh and also sharing with uh  local governments the uh  payment of salaries which would uh  let us cut down the unemployment rate much lower, before we hit the inflationary level. But I believe that by the end of the first four years of uh  of the next term we could have the unemployment down to 3 percent adult unemployment, which is about uh  4 to 4 and a half percent overall uh controlled inflation rate and have a uh balance of growth of about  uh 4 to 6 percent, around 5 percent which would give us a balanced budget.",1976-09-23,Democrat,527,What specific strategies do you believe are most effective for reducing unemployment and fostering economic growth in the current environment?
137,Mr. Carter,"Yes, in unemployment that is likely to create additional pressure on prices, how willing are you to consider an incomes policy, in other words, wage and price controls?",1976-09-23,Democrat,28,"How do you view the relationship between unemployment levels and inflation, and what specific measures would you consider to address potential price pressures in the economy?"
138,Mr. Carter,"Well  we now have such uh  a low utilization of uh  our productive capacity  uh about 73 percent; I think its about the lowest since the Great Depression years  and such a high unemployment rate now  uh 7.9 percent  that  uh we have a long way to go in getting people to work before we have the inflationary pressures. And I think this would uh  this would be uh easy to accomplish, to get jobs down, without having strong in- inflationary pressures that  that would be necessary. I would not favor the uh  payment of uh  of a given fixed income to people unless they are not able to work. But with tax incentives for the low-income groups we could build up their uh  income levels uh  above the poverty level and not uh make welfare more uh  profitable than  than work.",1976-09-23,Democrat,142,"What specific strategies would you propose to address the current low utilization of productive capacity and high unemployment rate, while also ensuring that work remains a viable option for those who are able?"
139,Mr. Carter,"Well, Mr. Ford is  is uh changing uh considerably his previous philosophy. The present tax structure is a disgrace to this country; its just a welfare program for the rich. As a matter of fact, uh  25 percent of the total tax deductions, go for only 1 percent of the richest people in this country, and over 50 percent of the tax uh credits go for the 14 percent of the richest people in this country. When Mr. Ford first became president in  in August of 1974, the first thing he did in  in October was to ask for a $4.7 billion increase in taxes on our people in the midst of the heaviest recession, since uh  since the great depression of nineteen uh  of the 1940s. In uh  January of 1975 he asked for a tax change: a $5.6 billion increase on low-and-middle-income private individuals, a six and a half billion dollar decrease on the corporations and the special interests. In uh  December of uh  1975 he vetoed the roughly 18 to 20 billion dollar uh tax-reduction bill that had been passed by the Congress, and then he came back later on in January of this year and he did advocate a $10 billion tax reduction, but it would be offset by a $6 billion increase this coming January in deductions for Social Security payments and for unemployment compensation. The whole philosophy of the Republican party, including uh  my opponent, has been to pile on taxes on low-income people to take em off on the corporations. As a matter fact, in  sin- since the late sixties when Mr. Nixon took office, weve had a reduction in uh  in the percentage of taxes paid by corporations from 30 percent down to about 20 percent. Weve had an increase in taxes paid by individuals, payroll taxes, from14 Percent up to 20 percent. And this is what the Republicans have done to us. And this is why a tax reform is so important.",1976-09-23,Democrat,331,"What are your views on the current tax structure, and how do you believe it impacts different income levels in the country?"
140,Mr. Carter,"Well, as a matter of fact there is. If we assume the ah  uh  a rate of growth of our economy, equivalent to what it was during President Johnson, President Kennedy, even before the  the  the  uh wa uh  Vietnese- namese War, and if we assume that at the end of the four-year period we can cut our unemployment rate down to 4 to 4 and a half percent  under those circumstances, even assuming no elimination of unnecessary programs and assuming an increase in the ad- in the allotment of money to finance programs, increasing as the inflation rate does  my economic projections, I think confirmed by the House uh  and the Senate committees, have been with the $60 billion extra amount of money that can be spent in fiscal year 81 which will be the last year of this next term. Within that sixty-billion dollars increase there would be fit the programs that I promised the American people. I might say too, that  that if we see that these goals cannot be reached  and I believe theyre reasonable goals  then I would cut back on the rate of implement- implementation of new programs in order to accommodate a balanced budget by fiscal year 81 which is the last year of the next term. I believe that we ought to have a balanced budget during normal economic circumstances. And uh  these projections have been very carefully made. I stand behind them. And if they should be in error slightly on the down side, then Ill phase in the programs that weve uh  advocated, more slowly.",1976-09-23,Democrat,265,"What specific economic goals do you believe are achievable during your presidency, and how do you plan to balance program funding with the need for a balanced budget?"
141,Mr. Carter,"Well, the uh  the assumption that  that you uh  have described as different is in the rate of growth of our economy.",1976-09-23,Democrat,22,What is your perspective on the current rate of economic growth and how it differs from past trends?
142,Mr. Carter,"I believe that its accurate to say that  that the  that the committees to whom you refer with the  the employment that you uh  state, and with the 5 to 5 and a half percent growth rate in our economy, that the uh  projections would be a uh  a $60 billion increase in the amount of money that wed have to spend in l981 compared to now. And uh  with that uh  in that framework would befit the  any improvements in the programs. Now this does not include uh  any uh  uh extra control over uh unnecessary spending, the weeding out of obsolete or obsolescent programs. Uh  well have uh  a safety version built in with complete reorganization of the executive branch of government which I am pledged to do. The present bureaucratic structure of the  of the Federal Government is a mess. And if Im elected president thats gonna be a top priority of mine to completely revise the structure of the federal government, to make it economical, efficient, purposeful and manageable for a change. And also, Im going to institute zero-based budgeting which I used four years in Georgia, which uh  assesses every program every year, and eliminates those programs that are obsolete or obsolescent. But with these projections, we will have a balanced budget by fiscal year 1981, if Im elected president. Keep my promises to the American people. And its just predicated on very modest, but I think accurate, projections of employment increases and uh  a growth in our national economy equal to what was experienced under Kennedy, Johnson, before the Vietnam War.",1976-09-23,Democrat,267,What specific reforms and strategies do you plan to implement to ensure economic growth and a balanced budget during your presidency?
143,Mr. Carter,"Well I think its uh very difficult for President Ford to uh  explain the difference between the pardon of President Nixon and  and uh  his attitude toward those who violated the draft laws. As a matter of fact  now- I dont advocate amnesty; I advocate pardon. Theres a difference in my opinion  uh and in accordance with the ruling of the Supreme Court and accordance with the definition in the dictionary. Amnesty means that  that you uh  that what you did was right. Pardon means that what you did, whether its right or wrong, youre forgiven for it. And I do advocate a pardon for  for draft evaders. I think its accurate to say that in uh  two years ago when Mr. Nixon  Mr. Ford put in this uh amnesty that three times as many deserters were uh  excused as were  as were the uh  the ones who evaded the draft. But I think that now is the time to heal our country after the Vietnam War and I think that what the people are concerned about is not the  uh pardon or the amnesty of uh  those who evaded the draft, but  but whether or not our crime system is  is fair. Weve got a  a sharp distinction drawn between white collar crime  the  the  the big shots who are rich, who are influential uh very seldom go to jail; those who are poor and  and who have uh no influence  uh quite often are the ones who are punished. And  and the whole uh subject of crime is one that concerns our people very much, and I believe that the fairness of it is  is what  uh  is a  is a major problem that addresses our  our leader and this is something that hasnt been addressed adequately by  by this administration. But I  I hope to have a complete uh responsibility on my shoulders to help bring about a  a fair uh  criminal justice system and also to  to bring about uh  an end to the  to the divise- divisiveness that has occurred in our country uh as a result of the Vietnam War.",1976-09-23,Democrat,356,What are your thoughts on the differences between pardoning individuals who evaded the draft and the amnesty policies implemented by President Ford concerning Vietnam-era draft dodgers?
144,Mr. Carter,"Well, Ive been through this before, Mr. Gannon, as the governor of Georgia. When I took aver we had uh a bureaucratic mess, like we have in Washington now, and we had three hundred agencies, departments, bureaus, commissions  uh some uh  fully budgeted, some not, but all having responsibility to carry out that was in conflict. And we cut those three hundred  uh agencies and so forth down substantially. We eliminated two hundred and seventy-eight of them. We set up a simple structure of government that could be administrated fairly and it was a  a tremendous success. It hasnt been undone since I was there. It resulted also in an ability to reshape our court system, our prison system, our education system, our mental health programs and  and a clear assignment of responsibility and  and authority and also to have uh our people once again understanding control our government. I intend to do the same thing if Im elected president. When I get to Washington, coming in as an outsider, one of the major responsibilities that  that I will have on my shoulder is a complete reorganization of the  of the executive branch of government. We now have uh  a greatly expanded White House staff. When Mr. Nixon went in office, for instance, we had three and a half million dollars spent on  on the White House and its staff. That has escalated now to sixteen and a half million dollars, in the last uh Republican administration. This needs to be changed. We need to put the responsibilities back on the cabinet members. We also need to have a great reduction in agencies and programs. For instance, we now have uh  in the health area three hundred and two different programs administered by eleven major departments and agencies, sixty other advisory commissions responsible for this. Medicaids in one agency; Medicare is in a different one. The  the check on the quality of health care is in a different one. None of them uh are responsible for health care itself. This makes it almost impossible for us to have a good health program. We have uh  just advocated uh  this past week a consolidation of the responsibilities for energy. Our country now has no comprehensive energy program or policy. We have twenty different agencies in the federal government responsible for the production, the regulation, the uh  information about energy, the conservation of energy, spread all over government. This is a  a gross waste of money, so tough, competent management of government, giving us a simple efficient purposeful and manageable government would be a great step forward and if Im elected  and I intend to be  then its gonna be done.",1976-09-23,Democrat,449,What specific changes do you plan to implement in the federal government to address what you see as inefficiencies and bureaucratic challenges?
145,Mr. Carter,"I cant say for sure that we would have fewer federal employees when I go out of office than when I come in. It took me about three years to completely reorganize the Georgia government. The last year I was in office uh  our budget was  was actually less than it was a year before, uh which showed a great uh improvement. Also, we had a  a 2 percent increase in the number of employees the last year. But it was a tremendous shift from administrative jobs into the delivery of services. For instance, we uh  completely revised our prison system. We established eighty-four new mental health treatment centers. And we shifted people out of administrative jobs into the field to deliver better services. The same thing will be done uh  at the federal government level. I  I accomplished this with s  substantial reductions in employees in some departments. For instance, in the Transportation Department uh we had uh  we cut back about 25 percent of the total number of employees. In giving our people better mental health care, we increased the number of employees. But the efficiency of it, the simplicity of it, the uh ability of people to understand their own government and control it was a  was a uh  substantial benefit derived from complete reorganization. We uh  have got to do that at the federal government level. If we dont, the bureaucratic mess is going to continue. Theres no way for our people now to understand what their government is. Theres no way to get the answer to a question. When you come to Washington to try to  as a governor  to try to begin a new program for your people, like uh the treatment of drug addicts, I found there were thirteen different federal agencies that I had to go to, to manage the uh drug treatment program. In the Georgia government we only had one agency responsible for drug treatment. This is the kind of change that would be made. And uh  it would be of  of tremendous benefit in long-range planning, in tight budgeting, uh saving the taxpayers money, making the government more efficient, cutting down on bureaucratic waste, having a clear delineation of authority and responsibility of employees, and giving our people a better chance to understand and control their government.",1976-09-23,Democrat,388,"What specific strategies or reforms would you implement to streamline federal government operations and improve efficiency, based on your experience in reorganizing the Georgia government?"
146,Mr. Carter,"Well, Mr. Ford takes the uh  same attitude that the Republicans always take. In the last three months before an election, theyre always for the programs that they always fight the other three-and-one-half years. Uh  I remember when uh  Herbert Hoover was against uh  jobs for people. I remember when Alf Landon was against Social Security and uh  later President Nixon, sixteen years ago, was telling the public that John Kennedys proposals would bankrupt the country and would double the cost. The best thing to do is to look at the record uh  of Mr. Fords Administration and Mr. Nixons before his. Uh  we had last year a $65 billion deficit  the largest deficit in the history of our country  more of a deficit spending than we had in the entire eight-year period under President Johnson and President Kennedy. Weve got five hundred thousand more Americans out of jobs today than were out of work three months ago and since Mr. Fords been in office two years, weve had a 50 percent increase in unemployment from five million people out of work to two and a half million more people out of work and a total of seven and a half million. Weve also got uh  a comparison between himself and Mr. Nixon. Hes got four times the size of the deficits that Mr. Nixon even had himself. This uh  talking about more people at work  uh is distorted because with a 14 percent increase in the cost of living in the last uh  two years, it means that  that women and young people have had to go to work when they didnt want to because their fathers didnt make enough to pay the increased cost of uh  food and uh housing and clothing. We have uh  in this last uh two years alone a hundred and twenty billion dollars total deficits under President Ford and uh  at the same time weve had, in the last eight years, a doubling in the number of bankruptcies for small business: weve had a negative growth in our  in our national economy measured in real dollars. The take-home pay of a worker in this country is actually less now than it was in 1968  measured in real dollars. This is the kind of record thats there and talk about the future and a drastic change or conversion on the part of Mr. Ford as of last minute is one that just doesnt go.",1976-09-23,Democrat,410,How do you respond to criticisms regarding your administration's economic policies and their impact on unemployment and the national deficit?
147,Mr. Carter,"Well among my other experiences in the past, Ive  Ive been a nuclear engineer, and did graduate work in this field. I think I know the  the uh capabilities and limitations of atomic power. But the energy  uh policy of our nation is one that uh has not yet been established under this administration. I think almost every other developed nation in the world has an energy policy except us. We have seen uh  the Federal Energy Agency established, for instance. Uh  in the crisis of 1973 it was supposed to be a temporary agency, uh now its permanent, its enormous, its growing every day. I think the Wall Street Journal uh reported not too long ago they have a hundred and twelve public relations experts working for the Federal Energy Agency to try to justify to the American people its own existence. Weve got to have a  a firm way to handle the energy question. The reorganization proposal that I have put forward is one uh first step. In addition to that, we need to have  uh a realization that weve got uh about thirty-five years worth of oil left in the whole world. Were gonna run out of oil. When Mr. Nixon made his famous uh speech on Operation Independence we were importing about 35 percent of our oil. Now weve increased that amount 25 percent. We now import about 44 percent of our oil. We need to shift from oil to coal. We need to concentrate our research and development effort on uh coal burning and extraction, with safer mines, but also its clean burning. We need to shift very strongly toward solar energy and have strict conservation measures. And then as a last resort only, continue to use atomic power. I would certainly uh  not cut out atomic power altogether. We cant afford to give up that opportunity until later. But to the extent that we continue to use atomic power, I would be responsible as president to make sure that the safety precautions were initiated and maintained. For instance, some that have been forgotten; we need to have the reactor core  below ground level, the entire power plant that uses atomic uh  power tightly sealed and a heavy  heavy vacuum maintained. There ought to be a standardized design. There ought to be a full-time uh  atomic energy specialist, independent of the power company in the control room, full time, twenty-four hours a day, to shut down a plant if an abnormality develops. These kinds of uh  procedures, along with evacuation procedures, adequate insurance, ought to be initiated. So, shift from oil to coal, emphasize research and development on coal use and also on solar power, strict conservation measures, not yield every time that the special interest groups uh  put pressure on the president like uh this administration has done, and use atomic energy only as a last resort with the strictest possible safety precautions. Thats the best overall energy policy in the brief time we have to discuss it.",1976-09-23,Democrat,504,What specific steps do you believe the federal government should take to establish a comprehensive energy policy that addresses both current needs and future sustainability?
148,Mr. Carter,"Yes, I would. Some of the things that can be done about this is a change in the rate structure of electric power companies. We uh  now encourage people to waste electricity, and uh  by giving uh  the lowest rates to the biggest users. We dont do anything to cut down on peak load requirements. We dont have an adequate requirement for the insulation of homes, for the efficiency of automobiles. And whenever the uh  automobile manufacturers come forward and say they cant meet the uh  amendments that the Congress has put forward, this Republican administration has delayed the implementation dates. In addition to that, we ought to have a  a shift toward the use of coal, particularly in the Appalachian regions where the coal is located. A lot of uh  very high quality, low-carbon coal, uh  low-sulfur coal is there, its where our employment is needed. Uh  this would  would help a great deal. So mandatory conservation measures  yes. Encouragement by the president for people to uh voluntarily conserve  yes. And also the private sector ought to be encouraged to  to bring forward to the public the benefits from efficiency. One bank in uh  Washington, fo- for instance, gives lower interest loans for people who adequately insulate their homes or who buy efficient automobiles. And some major uh  uh  manufacturing companies, like Dow Chemical, have through uh  very effective efficiency mechanism cut down the use of energy by uh  as much as 40 percent with the same out-product. These kinds of things uh  ought to be done, uh they ought to be encouraged and supported, and even required uh by the government, yes.",1976-09-23,Democrat,274,What specific policies do you believe should be implemented to promote energy conservation and efficiency in both residential and industrial sectors?
149,Mr. Carter,"Well, Mr. Ford doesnt seem to put into perspective the fact that when  when uh five hundred thousand more people are out of work than there were three months ago, while we have two and a half million more people out of work than were when he took office, that this touches human beings. I was in uh  a city in uh  Pennsylvania not too long ago, near here, and uh  there were about four or five thousand people in the audience  it was on a  on a train trip. And I said, How many uh  adults here are out of work? About a thousand raised their hands. Mr. Ford uh  actually has fewer people now in the private sector in non-farm jobs than when he took office. And still he talks about  uh success. Seven point nine percent unemployment is a terrible tragedy in this country. He says hes learned how to match unemployment with inflation. Thats right. Weve got the highest inflation weve had in twenty-five years right now, except under this administration, and that was fifty years ago. And weve got uh  the highest unemployment weve had uh  under Mr. Fords administration, since the Great Depression. This affects human beings, and  and his insensitivity in providing those people a chance to work has made this a welfare administration, and not a work administration. He hasnt saved $9 billion with his vetoes. Theres only been uh  a net savings of $4 billion. And the cost in unemployment compensation, welfare compensation, and lost revenues has increased $23 billion in the last two years. This is a  a typical attitude that really causes havoc in peoples lives, and then its covered over by saying that our country has naturally got a 6 percent unemployment rate, or 7 percent unemployment rate and a 6 percent inflation. Its a travesty. It shows a lack of leadership. And weve never had a president since the War between the States that vetoed more bills. Mr. Ford has vetoed four times as many bills as Mr. Nixon  per year. And eleven of em have been overridden. One of his bills that was overridden  he only got one vote in the Senate and seven votes in the House, from Republicans.",1976-09-23,Democrat,374,"What is your assessment of the current unemployment and inflation rates, and how do you respond to the concerns that these figures represent a deeper human impact on American families?"
150,Mr. Carter,"Now we have uh such a grossly unbalanced tax system  as I said earlier, that it is a disgrace  ah of all the tax  benefits now, 25 percent of em go to the 1 percent of the richest people in this country. Over 50 percent  53 to be exact  percent of the tax benefits go to the 14 percent richest people in this country, and weve had a 50 percent increase in payroll deductions since Mr. Nixon went in office eight years ago. Mr. Ford has  has advocated since hes been in office over $5 billion in reductions for corporations, special interest groups, and the very, very wealthy who derive their income  not from labor  but from investments. Thats got to be changed. A few things that can be done: we have now a deferral system so that the multinational corporations who invest overseas  if they make a million dollars in profits overseas  they dont have to pay any of their taxes unless they bring their money back into this country. When they dont pay their taxes, the average American pays the taxes for them. Not only that, but it robs this country of jobs, because instead of coming back with that million dollars and creating a shoe factory, say in New Hampshire or Vermont, if the company takes the money down to Italy and  and builds a shoe factory, they dont have to pay any taxes on the money. Another thing is a system called DISC which was originally designed, proposed by Mr. Nixon, to encourage exports. This permits a company to create uh  a dummy corporation, to export their products, and then not to pay the full amount of taxes on them. This costs our uh  government about uh  $1.4 billion a year. And when those rich corporations dont pay that tax, the average American taxpayer pays it for em. Another one thats uh  thats very important is the uh  is the business deductions, uh  jet airplanes, uh  first class travel, the fifty-dollar martini lunch. The average working person cant  uh  cant take advantage of that, but the  the wealthier people  uh can. Uh  another system is where uhh  a dentist can invest money in say, raising cattle and uh  can put in a hundred thousand dollars of his own money, borrow nine hundred thousand dollars  nine hundred mi- thousand dollars  that makes a million  and mark off a great amount of uh  of loss uh  through that procedure. Uh  there was one example, for instance, where uh  somebody uh  produced pornographic movies. They put in $30 thousand of their own money and got a hundred and twenty thousand dollars in tax savings. Well, these special kinds of programs have  have robbed the average taxpayer and have benefited those who are powerful, and who can employ lobbyists, and who can have their CPAs and their lawyers to help them benefit from the roughly uh  eight thousand pages of the tax code. The average uh American person cant do it. You cant hire a lobbyist uh out of unemployment compensation checks.",1976-09-23,Democrat,512,"How do you imagine the current tax system impacts income inequality in America, and what specific reforms would you propose to address its imbalances?"
151,Mr. Carter,"Yes. You need about, according to Congressional committees on this, you need about $10 billion. Now you listed some things  the uh  deferral on foreign income as estimated: that would save about $500 million. DISC, you said, was about 1.4 billion. uh  The estimate of the outside, if you eliminated all tax shelters, is 5 billion. So where else would you raise the revenue to provide this tax relief  would you, in fact, do away with all business deductions, and what other kinds of preferences would you do away with?",1976-09-23,Democrat,90,"What specific measures would you propose to generate the necessary revenue to offset the tax relief you're advocating, particularly regarding business deductions and other tax preferences?"
152,Mr. Carter,"No, I wouldnt do away with all  uh business deductions. I think that would be a  a very serious mistake. But uh  if  if you could just do away with the ones that are unfair, you could lower taxes for everyone. I would never do anything that would increase the taxes for those who work for a living, or who are presently required to list all their income. What I wanna do is not to raise taxes, but to eliminate loopholes. And this is uh  the point of my first statistics that I gave you  that  that the present tax benefits that have been carved out over a long period of years  fifty years  by sharp tax lawyers and by lobbyists have benefited just the rich. These programs that I described to you earlier  the tax deferrals for overseas, the DISC, and the tax shelters, uh  they only apply to people in the $50 thousand-a-year bracket or up, and I think this is the very best way to approach it. Its to make sure that everybody pays taxes on the income that they earn and make sure that you take whatever savings there is from the higher income levels and give it to the lower- and middle-income families.",1976-09-23,Democrat,208,"What is your stance on business tax deductions, and how do you propose to ensure that the tax system is fair for all income levels?"
153,Mr. Carter,"Well, its not a matter of uh  Republican and Democrat. Its a matter of leadership or no leadership. President Eisenhower worked with a Democratic Congress very well. Even President Nixon, because he was a strong leader at least, worked with a Democratic Congress very well. Uh  Mr. Ford has vetoed, as I said earlier, four times as many bills per year as Mr. Nixon. Mr. Ford quite often puts forward a program just as a public relations stunt, and never tries to put it through the Congress by working with the Congress. I think under presidents For- uh  Nixon and Eisenhower they passed about 60 to 75 percent of their legislation. This year Mr. Ford will not pass more than 26 percent of all the legislative proposals he puts forward. This is government by stalemate, and weve seen almost a complete breakdown in the proper relationship between the president, who represents this country, and the Congress, who collectively also represent this country. Weve had uh  Republican presidents before whove tried to run against a Democratic  uh Congress. And I dont think its uh  the Congress is Mr. Fords opponent; but if uh  if  if he insists that uh  that I be responsible for the Democratic Congress, of which Im  have not been a part, then I think its only fair that he be responsible for the Nixon administration in its entirety, of which he was a part. That, I think, is a good balance. But the point is, that  that a president ought to lead this country. Mr. Ford, so far as I know, except for avoiding another Watergate, has not accomplished one single major program for this country. And theres been a constant squabbling between the president and the Congress, and thats not the way this country ought to be run. I might go back to one other thing. Mr. Ford has uh  misquoted an AP uh  news story that was in error to begin with. That story reported several times that I would lower taxes for low and middle-income families and uh  that correction was delivered to the White House and I am sure that the president knows about this uh  correction, but he still insists uh  on repeating an erroneous statement.",1976-09-23,Democrat,374,"What are your thoughts on the relationship between the presidency and Congress, and how do you believe effective leadership can bridge political divides?"
154,Mr. Carter,"What I have said is that the president ought to have a chance to appoint a chairman of the Federal Reserve Board to have a coterminous uh term; in other words, both of em serve the same four  four years. The Congress can modify the supply of money by modifying the income uh tax laws. The president can modify the uh  economic structure of a country by public statements and general attitudes in the budget that he proposes. The Federal Reserve has uh  an independent status that ought to be preserved; I think that Mr. uh  Burns did take a typical, erroneous Republican attitude in the 1973 year when inflation was so high. They assumed that the uh  inflation rate was because of excessive demand and uh  therefore put into effect tight constraint on the economy, very high interest rates, which is typical also of the Republican administration, uh  tried to increase the uh  the tax uh  payments by individuals, and cut the tax payments by corporations. I would have uh  done it opposite. I think the uh  problem shouldve been addressed by increasing productivity, by having uh  put  put people back to work so they could purchase more goods, lower income taxes on individuals, perhaps raise them, if necessary, on corporations in comparison. But uh  Mr. Burns uh  in that respect made a very serious mistake. I would not wanna destroy the  the independence of the uh Federal Reserve  uh Board. But I do think we ought to have a cohesive economic policy with at  at least the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board and the presidents terms being uh  the same and letting the Congress, of course, be the third uh  entity with uh  with independence subject only to the presidents veto.",1976-09-23,Democrat,294,"How do you envision the relationship between the presidency and the Federal Reserve in terms of economic policy, and what changes would you propose to improve that dynamic?"
155,Mr. Carter,"Well, one of the very serious things thats happened in our government in recent years, and has continued up until now, is a breakdown in the trust among our people in the [twenty-seven-minute delay]",1976-09-23,Democrat,34,What do you believe are the main factors contributing to the erosion of trust between the government and the American people?
156,Mr. Carter,There has been too much government secrecy and not uh  not enough respect for the personal privacy of American citizens.,1976-09-23,Democrat,20,What is your stance on government transparency and the impact of current policies on the personal privacy of American citizens?
157,Mr. Carter,"Well, tonight weve had a chance to talk a lot about the past. But I think its time to talk about the future. Our nation in the last eight years has been divided as never before. Its a time for unity. Its a time to draw ourselves together: to have a president and a Congress that can work together with mutual respect for a change, cooperating for a change, in the open for a change, so the people can understand their own government. Its time for government, industry, labor, manufacturing, agriculture, education, other entities in our society to cooperate. And its a time for government to understand and to cooperate with our people. For a long time our American citizens have been excluded, sometimes misled, sometimes have been lied to. This is uh  not compatible with the purpose of our nation. I believe in our country. It needs to be competent. The government needs to be well-managed, efficient, economical, We need to have a government thats sensitive to our peoples needs  to those who are poor, who dont have adequate health care, who have been cheated too long with our tax programs, whove been out of jobs, whose families have been torn apart. We need to restore the faith and the trust of the American people in their own government. In addition to that, weve suffered because we havent had leadership in this administration. Weve got a government of stalemate. Weve lost the vision of what our country can and ought to be. This is not the America that weve known in the past. Its not the America that we have to have in the future. I dont claim to know all the answers. But Ive got confidence in my country. Our economic strength is still there. Our system of government  in spite of Vietnam, Cambodia, CIA, Watergate  is still the best system of government on earth. And the greatest resource of all are the two hundred and fifteen million Americans who have within us the strength, the character, the intelligence, the experience, the patriotism, the idealism, the compassion, the sense of brotherhood on which we can rely in the future to restore the greatness to our country We ought not to be excluded from our government anymore. We need a president who can go in  who derives his strength from the people. I owe the special interests nothing. I owe everything to you, the people of this country. And I believe that we can bind our wounds. I believe that we can work together. And I believe that if we can tap the tremendous untapped reservoir of innate strength in this country, that we can once again have a government as good as our people, and let the world know what we still know and hope for  that we still live in the greatest and the strongest and the best country on earth.",1976-09-23,Democrat,484,"Can you share your vision for how our government can foster unity and cooperation among different sectors of society, and how you plan to restore trust between the American people and their government?"
