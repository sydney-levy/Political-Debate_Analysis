And we can fix it. It's broken by design. It's broken by incompetence. He and his administration, every Republican, every conservative, both sides of the aisle, want a system that works. So we get virtue out of the bounty of America where immigrants join our cause, join ourcountry, become American citizens, assimilate, take our values. That's a virtuous system. An earned pathway to citizenship through work in this country. Not a free pass for everybody across the border. Which is what's happening now. They know it. That's what's happening in New York. That's what's happening in Chicago. That's what's happening everywhere. And he's doing it through executive order because Congress refuses to pass his immigration legislation. Republican Congress folks asked him to enforce the law in the budget and he refused to do it. He is literally breaking the back of immigrants with the flood of those who don't respect our rule of law and our sovereignty so we can actually help those who most deserve it. Those who are coming here in fear, persecuted. We should join them with our rules of law.

Which is we have to stop our jobs from being stolen from ourselves and other countries. And I believe I Am able to do it and do it effectively. And then about a month ago, we took in $600 billion in trade balance. Our horrible balance of trade is now for the first time since perhaps Eric can tell me, since about 1977 has now turned positive. Took 42 years. When I mentioned it to him, he said well, we had coming in every year, helps but id like to get more money back. So I just want to say that, look, shes been doing this for a long time. Hers is a twisted, twisted, you know, good at doing this. Well, shes attributed to this and that. But its only a word for word.

But every time-- and if you think оf it, helach wtherer heisn't whether it's justice or anything else, he says, ""the environmentalist."" Why would I call out the environmentalists?
