Question,Model_Response
Why do you believe you are fit to be the next leader of the United States of America?,"I dont think either one of us would be sitting here tonight if there werent something wrong with  with the nation. And Im not sitting here to give you a list of grievances. Im here to tell you that our nation can be better, and I know how to do it. The country may be becoming frustrated with politicians. That might be good in modernizing the system and in  reforming our government. But dont confuse cynicism with the nation with doubt as to this. The people of this country have to make one of the most important decisions they ever had to make in a long time. And you can compare this my short-cuts with their shortcuts. And I hope that, in doing that, Ive earned your confidence. Its a long, long way to the Oval Office, but I think Im halfway there. And I think Ive earned your confidence, and I think theres going to be, in the Spirit of `76, a great tomorrow. Ive heard `em say, `Give the other guy a chance. Well, hes had his chance, and hes failing the test."
What is your overarching vision for the country?,"Well, the first thing is I believe in America. I go around the nation and I see the American spirit, I see people who work hard, I see technical achievement, I see industries leading the world. I see our educational institutions doing marvelous things. Im not cynical. Its just that weve had some glitches. We had six years of a Republican administration before I came into this office. Weve had three years of Democratic administration since Ive been here. But what we have to do, in my judgment, is to get the nation united once again as we did in the early days when I first became in office after Watergate, after Vietnam. We got the congress, the presidency, the business community labor working together. We set some goals; we proved we could set some goals; we proved we could reach them. We proved we could build up a spirit of confidence in ourselves. Thats the major problem that we have. Whether its a drought, whether its a poor agriculture year, whether its a inflationary year, or whether its a time of depressionwe can set a target, we can reach it. This is a great nation. We control our own destiny. The philosophy I have is the one Ive exercised in office: its to be open, its to let everybody in let the American people be the judge. I put my own record up against my predecessors any time. Im open to let the people look at that record, to learn, and then to decide whos best qualified to lead the nation for the next four years."
What is your plan to manage inflation and ensure economic stability?,"Inflation, as we all know, is caused ultimately by an imbalance between the demand for goods and services and the supply of goods and services. When you have too many dollars in the hands of the people competing for goods that dont exist or for goods that are scarce, the prices go up, and you have inflation. The best antidote to inflation is a steady, continuing, healthy growing economy. When were able to provide jobs for people, were able to supply goods and services  cars, refrigerators, washing machines, houses, neighborhood shopping centers, employment opportunities  to meet the demands of people, then we have a slowing down of inflation. This administration has followed a policy of prayer and hope. Weve had a massive infusion of dollars into the economy through the budget deficits, through tax benefits for the wealthy, and a commitment to increase the cost to government for housing and for student loans and for other programs, which has only put more money into the hands of people competing for goods that dont exist. Secondly, theres been an exorbitant rise in the cost of energy. This administration has given the oil companies a tax break equal to $26 for every barrel of oil they produce. Thats equivalent to a Ford Pinto in every garage in this country  a profit to the oil companies whose profits have gone up 90 percent in the last 2 years. And thirdly, this administration has been committed to a monetary policy approach, which ironically is similar in some respects to President Carters. When interest rates are allowed to rise  indexed interest rates, for instance,  in a very steep and sudden way, people tend to pull back and wait until the interest rates settle down before they make major purchases. A lot of what this administration has done has caused inflation to go up, and we can replace that with a sound, steady, continuing policy which insists on strong economic growth. Thats my commitment."
How will you create jobs and reduce unemployment across the nation?,"I believe that this forty-one percent unemployment rate among teenagers is a disgrace. I dont want to spend all my political life running around saying, Oh, look how good were doing. I want it to Continue."
What steps will you take to balance the federal budget and manage the national debt?,"I have set a target for us to balance the federal budget  an achievable target of 1990. I dont believe Gov. Reagans budget next year will put it off by two years, and despite what he says, will balance the budget. He had a similar tax reform effort last year. Hes going to have more revenue from the tax reform than he says and still no tax reform. I want to make this schedule, and well take a comprehensive program to do it, increasing revenues preferably through a growing economy at least modestly, across-the-board spending cuts without crippling social programs, and reexaming our military position. We will have defense and security, but we have staffing levels in the Pentagon and in Europe that all the analysts say are unnecessary. We will be responsible in the way we achieve a balanced budget, but we will certainly do it. And also Gov. Reagan says that we might not have to balance the budget every year to achieve citizenship in the world financial community. That might be true. But on a good year, were probably not going to grow 5 or 6 percent a year. And if we have a good year, even if we have a moderate growth program like I call for, we probably will have to balance the budget almost every year to get that growth. And we also have this terrible deficit crisis, this debt burden caused by Gov. Reagans policies. Weve got to achieve a more secure, stable international monetary position by getting rid of the trade and budget deficits. And you wont do that without a balanced budget. And also weve got to find a way to stabilize the dollar around the world. Governor Reagan has resisted desperately a program that at least on a voluntary basis makes our huge creditor nations join with us to stabilize our debt. We ought to do that. That ought to be done. It can be done. Also hes not called for a 25 percent reduction in real interest rates. These very high interest rates are a direct result of the deficit burden imposed by Governor Reagans policies. And we need stronger economic growth. We had three and 4 percent growth rates in 82 and 83 very weak. "
How will you ensure that all Americans have access to quality and affordable healthcare?,"Well, let me clarify that. I believe that we should provide health care to every single American in this country at a cost we can afford. Under our approach, any American who wanted to purchase catastrophic health service  insurance could do so, and it would be at a very affordable cost, approximately $25 a month for a family. And all Americans would be covered for all necessary costs in hospital care, outpatient care, doctors fees, and so forth. This is a major commitment of our administration, and Im sure that itll pass in the next Congress. We must see that every American, in emergencies or disasters, is covered for excessive health care costs. That, to me, is a basic commitment of our government."
How will your administration address the pressing challenges of environmental sustainability?,"I think the two highest commitments that a new President  like president does  are uh- jobs and our environment. Uh- with uh- uh-  inflation having gone down so dramatically and uh- our- our economy recovering uh- weve got le- less then three weeks to  well be at uh- normal or full employment jobs by  thats 93 million jobs  well be going to 93 million jobs thats only 4 million new jobs. Uh- 93 million jobs between now and the end of my term in 1980, if Im reelected, will only have 4 million uh- 4% inflation and an-n-not 7, 8, 9% inflation. Thats  a re- real two million increase in jobs accomplish between now and then. Even with 93 million jobs we could map an-out the unemployment levels by sex, by age, uh- by race, and by  by section of-the nation. Uh- and uh- club the uh- uh-  people that are d-disabled or in minorities or the uh-  people south of the Mason-Dixon line  uh- with a more complete volume of construction, small business, and so forth and so on. And we can focus on those areas with attack-and this might be a 1% extra uh- uh- area where wh- our unemployment levels might get moveted so could be a 3% 3.5% minimal unemployment rate, our- out in the far spaced uh-  while the urban centers will have approximately  uh- the- the level of unemployment now, wh- which we re- we should have a- a- kind of a stimulation of uh- demand  that would put teach-the back uh- to education, the handicap, the blind, the  and so forth uh- to a  shorter work week. An-  and then after that  after wed reached our maximum uh- level of employment like that, our uh- programs, I think, now across the board have been uh- successful as well as with the uh-  energy program which  which is shiftin  now bringing about exportation of coal instead of importation of coal and uh- beginning to drill more uh- oil and pump more oil up from the existing wells, I think well have a reason uh- to- to- to expect a very balanced uh- growth  with no undue inflation or excessive uh- consumer demand  that might raise prices. I think at that point we can approach the uh-  employment level with uh-wh- wh- what we can wha- what we can avoid is wh- uh- that-  that strange things in the economy, like a uh- uh- frustration that might grow up by uh- expanding our economy too fast where we might have rising uh- prices. I think we can avoid that  tho-  to a minimum without excessive  inflation by doing it that way  also. And uh- I  I know that we have uh- uh- not isolated the number of jobs, going on a- on an  export in our employment uh- policy. But I think the most important thing uh- that we-  got to do right now  in addition to that is to m-make sure that we have a acc a- acc progressive economic policy  that will uh-  keep a- a stable  economy, with no undue inflation added on  so that we dont have destruction uh- that uh- that we a- would have uh- of  of the environment.  Now with the environment, theres at least 3 or 4 important points.  No administration in the environmental program has done better than mine  and I think thats correct.  The clean air act has been revised for the second year  and it  has passed easily in both The House of Representatives and also the senate. Both uh-  Mrs. Granholm, the uh- chairperson of uh- the environmental uh- committee has  has been helpful to the  to the administration also. Uh- the- the clean water uh- s- system has been one that weve pushed  with strong uh-  support from the Congress and the  in both the republican and Democratic parties uh- for studies of the j- technological, the studies uh- capable of bringing uh- non uh-  pollution a- a- a- a- ativo uh- opportunities for our  fo- for our factories and so forth now, our  our- our- our- our-  ships  uh- to  to- to rach that uh- technical goal  and well be working even  even closer with  with that labor management understanding of the  of  of the technics there, the  of  of uh- uh- uh- ef- effective uh- procedures and  and persons, uh- then weve got a- probably 10 years to reach the ultimate there in that respect. Uh- weve had some uh  additional environmental uh- policies recommended by my commission on- on- on uh  was it environmental matters and problems  but their recommendations implementation  in at least wh- two or three uh- concrete and effective ways. Uh- well continue to do that now with the- with a real effort in the- in the- in the- in the  in the- in the- in the  environment. I  I guess that wha- I- I consider th  probably th  most important uh-  m-3, 3 or 4 important areas that is raw materials  ex- exportation o-of uh- minerals uh- that now uh-  we-  a- a complete control we feel  now that we are the only uh- nation of uh- uh-  the world  most advanced industrialized na- nations  that have f- finished that-  the- the  the mineral resources need basic industries there. I was down in Tennessee  couple - couple weeks ago at-  with j- with Alcoa pollen aluminum  and they making uh- added uh- technological procedures now. Its been  uh- two smelting plants wh- where they reach a- a- a reduced  l- l- l-l-l-l-  l- l- l  l- l- l- l-  l- l- lt-  l- l  efficiency uh-  to do that. They recover the alum- uh- from the  from the u- uh-  ore uh- even wh- when the- when it- its a- at a  greater uh- efficiency before smelting, beca- cause they can s-smelt in a  much lower temperature. This is an- an example of- of- of- of uh  f- uh- f- very uh productive uh  communications between labor management  the government, and us now  and us wh- with- with the l-  particular fo- goal there. Uh- that kind of thing I think could b- b- b- b  b- b-  could be emanated uh- at- at a great  future in the next uh- 3 or 4 or 5 years. Theres a lot more emphasis placed on uh- uh- r  research grants uh- productive uh- a- procedures uh-  methods  so that uh- we can keep our- our- our- our minerals  but do so in a-  in a- in a pro-peac-  profit-wise  3ore and fair way. This- this means, for instance, that we still got a- al- aluminum uh- uh- t- target that o- that our uh-  procedures will have a l- l- l  lower uh  achieving uh  profits uh- at a greater  and a greater efficiency of increased uh- uh  s-smelting. This  we still target uh- to b- bring  al- aluminum  a- 4 a- 4 4 an- a- an  and a-  and 4 uh four dollars  a- an 4- 4 uh uh a l- la- low l-l-p-po- produ-  p- producing a- a- a- a- a- 4 dollar p- per ton-  per ton of plants smelting  in other mm  and wo- wo- wo- wh- it- it w-  would be uh 6, for instance uh- sh-sh- so ah- we- we keep with that  and by a complete minimization of- of w- waste uh-  concealed uh- lines uh  l-  i- a  4  4 conception  con- congruity ag- against- again uh- our- our- our  uh- sed- dr- deposit  uh-  companies that would kee- keep em keep our m- minerals, keep em provid- provide em in a- in a  in a- in a productive  uh and  and then id- id- identification of the- of t- of the  of the target uh- uh- uh-  cost with management uh- a- a- a-  a- a- a-  j-j- j- jus-just uh- uh- close to the- to the uh- the higher upper uh-  rer uh  re- re- around f- four- round four dollars at ton uh  w- wh- a- a- very great f-f-f- fk- f- basically uh-  productive uh- management  the  a s- sil- syntax as uh- as- as- as t- as a- as a- as a standard  uh- dolla 4 4 4 4 d-  with a- with a- a- a- target  problem  target goal uh- in- in- in- inste- inste- inste  in- in  in control yield  we get it 4-4-4- dollars a ton in-s- in- standard where- where th-th- the- the  target s- standardized uh- and w- wo- w- w- we wo-won  wh- whe  where- less st- uh d- dollar  understanding refundalu-ing o- or- or uh  cl- clarity but  uh- uh- more clear  more pure with a- a whole- whole ho- calling for-wh-wh-wh-  wt  it called- to be called uh- matter with wh- uh p- p- p  an  standard  4 d- 4 do 4 d- targ- tar- target  we  we w- wh- th tha-tha- that's wh-wh- wh  wha- where we parallel- paralleled uh- t- t- t  tgt-improvement-cost- i  o- o-sein-in- in p- con- controlled) h- h- tp:  uh s- q-que explanation uh- fr: an should- b  b  l  l f l  a-h-h- an- as- as- as-who  uh- an-  too  v- v- v- b- a-  similar  the  p-p  p-  a- an- as-as  v- v- v- pi- a v-v- hd  h- h-a- whj b- f w- a-th-a- t- t- t- t- t-u q s ss ss ss e d d-d-d  d-d  d-d  e-a-e-p  4 4 4 4 4 4-a-g-g-g-g-a--e-4 2 2 4 1-1 1 1-g-g-g-g-g-g ss q  a- p- 4 4 4-g-g-a v v v 4 4 4 4 1 1 1 s- s- s- s 4 4 4 g s-a a-g 3 e d e 2 4 4 4 p p  πρωί- w- w- w- on-n- 4 4 4 2 3 - ""$(t-address!""$'A!( обор }} 4 4 2 2 2 2'- 2 d 2 e e 4 4 2 p- - e e  f 4 4 4 3  e- -w e e- ф App e- e- e  z- 4 d d p p 1 2 2 w 4 4 4 4 l-wc 3 e 2 e - e- e- e q  - d d 2 2 4 4  л~"":{""fujarati-]])"
What are your top priorities in regards to foreign policy?How will you strengthen America's national defense and handle relations with adversarial nations?,"Well, Governor Reagan sees the world in such stark black-and-white terms. I think one of the most dangerous things that he has said in this campaign was that the Soviet Union is a second-rate power. Its only toe hold or influence is in the Far East, no influence at all in Eastern Europe, or in Africa, or in South America, or in Western Europe, or in Canada, or in Australia. Thats very serious, and a President ought to know that. To make certain that we have a strong defensewith a strong military systemis one very important aspect of what a President ought to be most concerned about. Anyway immediate priority is to make certain that we have a strong tracking weapon to give our own people, let the Soviet Union know about it, but insist upon a real and verifiable reduction in all those weapons that could destroy the security of the Western world. Those are my immediate priorities."
What reforms would you propose to improve the education system?,"I think that Mr. Andews, in his chart, has shown why the Department of Education ought to be eliminated. When the Congress passed the omnibus, uh, education, uh, Educational Improvement Act and asked the Department of Education what it was going to do with it, it just printed out the bill as its uh, response. The uh, Department of Education hasnt done a single thing to us that hasnt been done, that uh, the uh, previous Administration hadnt started on Maryland and the Governor and President. However, there was a 26 percent increase in education spending during the Administration. And I think that what we ought to do and what I would do is put the systems back uh, in charge without frequent interference by the federal government, and make sure that the funding is there. The Proposition 13 syndrome of cutting taxes was something that the President advocated, even tho he wants to distance himself now. And as a result, there have been a number of slashes in education budgets at state and local levels. When uh, Governor Brown was uh, Governor of California, he did the same thing. He proposed Proposition 13 so-called. The 13 was the percentage of cuts that were  were leveled against education as a result of that. We ought to stop all of these audits. One of the biggest burdens of interference now in schools is that the uh, federal government is always going in there, even with the tiny sliver of money they provide, and doing uh, audits to find out how that money was spent. And the courts have been inundated with uh, complaints about uh, the interference by the federal government in our uh, schools. And finally, we ought to devote it to the kind of uh, things that we all can agree on: to improving teacher training. This is been a long-time recognized uh, area of responsibility thats been neglected. We ought to put the money into curriculum development. Uh, we ought to do something about uh, library materials and avoid turnout, fight dropout. I  I gave out some, some numbers the other day about dropout rates. Its gone from 12 percent  to 12.2 percent under this Administration, and  they got progressively worse during the Bush and Reagan years. We need to stabilize, without interference, our schools."
How will you restore trust in government and ensure transparency in your administration?,"We get right back to the commitment to openness. I know that  any problems that beset the making of our Constitution, or in the early presidencies of our country or in the late presidencies this century,  are still with us. We  have to answer the question why. We should not have to answer that question. We dont have a King: we have the peoples government. And with this computer age, every  all the records of any agency of government should be made known in some reasonable time. I dont mind people having secrets that my enemy has or the countrys enemy has. I mind that the United States President and the people are not in complete partnership in the workings of our government. I promise the American people that Ill be in that White House every day. Im not going to live up in Camp David like Ford and Nixon did. Ill be there every day and Ill know what the problems are every day because Inquiry or inquiry or questioning will take place every day. The press should have a chance to explore every issue. Every American citizen must have the right to use the courts by questioning a decision of government that seems unreasonable in a short time frame, not years. This is what the nation, I believe, expects. I think the spirit of inquiry, the press questioning the powers that be and the facts being made known to the American people so they know what is going on, either puts to rest the awful doubts that have come into our society or exposes to the bright light of power, corruption, conflict of interest. We must have that and we will have it. I believe that if I can be trusted by  in 174 debates with the American people, Ill be able to live up to that basic principle."
What policies will you pursue to ensure equality and protect the rights of all Americans?,"As I indicated earlier  and not switching the subject, but this will be applicable  our present civil rights laws and affirmative action programs have been applied extensively, and have resulted in fulfilling the hopes and ambitions of millions of minority Americans, and women, in the workplace and in education. I have seen almost miraculous,positive, hopeful, beautiful results from these two groups. As a matter of fact,between now and the year 2000, we anticipate that 80 percent of all the new jobs created will be going to women and minority persons. I think this is a good thing for our country. Now, if Governor Reagan is suggesting that we repeal the present civil rights laws, or repeal affirmative action, then we will go backward, not forward. I recall a statement made by a wealthy White businessman some months ago. He said, I dont want affirmative action  I want a fair chance. Well, Mr. Reagan and I and most wealthy people in this country had a fair chance, and weve made very good use of it. But that doesnt mean that all of our citizens, who are poor, or who are minorities, or who are women, should not have the same opportunity. I believe very strongly in that, and I have not seen any evidence that the present affirmative action programs have discriminated against White Americans, nor against well-off Americans."
How will you lead the country through challenges and unite Americans with differing perspectives?,"First of all, I never think of an election as a mandate by the American public. Thats why I would love to have a much broader constituency than just 51 percent of those  who voted. I would like to draw upon all of my constituent Americans. This country has within it so much strength, so much diversity, so much vitality. What I want to do is to bring together in a unified, harmonious coalition all of those fragmented pieces. Candidly, the reason why Im running is because I want to put this country back together again after the lost opportunity of the 1980s."
"What is your plan to manage immigration in a way that balances national security, economic needs, and humanitarian responsibilities?","Would the President like to add to the comments related to the people of the Soviet Union?  If not, Mr. Anthony, your question."
How will you ensure equal opportunities for marginalized communities in our country?,"Let me, let me make one comment about the handicap community, quickly: In my administration we are negotiating with the major airlines to correct the problem with them so that we can make our airports and our airline services available. This has been unaddressed for all of our history, and they say its three years away. We have been in a negotiation, among other things with them, and I can guarantee you, as president of the United States, it will be accomplished in my administration. Because I am absolutely committed to that. I might say, shortly there will be a wonderful TV special on the handicap community called The Incredible People; it will be going on shortly, and Im sure that it will not only make you see our handicapped community in perspective, which is so positive, but Im sure the enthusiasm will catch up on the airline industry. Now to get back to your question, and yours was a very complicated ones and perhaps I can do them both in my final answer. Ive mentioned the concept of a comprehensive, overall, uh antidiscrimination act, which I would absolutely interest myself personally in and work through a Congress that would cooperate. In each of the situations which youve mentioned, whether its jobs for minorities, whether its equal pay for comparable work, whether its in the situation of the women in the credit situation that I cited, in all of those instances there have been wonderful groups who have been honest in their attempts to deal fairly and equitably with the, in this instance, the discrimination, in the others, to correct the error. In each of those instances, it has been the leadership of the Republican administration that has vetoed the corrections and the remedies. The civil rights leadership, liberal leadership of this country has not only stuck together, but weve generally had some good responses from the Congress. I feel our administration can do more. Five of our Presidents have been Republicans in this century. In the ninety-seventh Congress, only thirty-eight civil rights laws were passed. In the twenty-six Congresses preceding the ninety-seventh Congress, with five Republican presidents, three hundred and forty-two civil rights laws passed. Civil rights legislation has normally originated with the executive branch. It has not done so, with this administration. We all remember the original appointment of high office positions in the executive branch wherein only one-third of the positions went to minorities or womens groups. That belatedly changed because the Republicans were ashamed, and it changed on account of the political pressure. That is not the best way to govern."
Why do you believe you are fit to be the next leader of the United States of America?,Well it might take a lot of time for me to answer that.
What is your overarching vision for the country?,Thats a uh  very difficult question for me in that Im not exactly sure how to encapsulate what I believe and uh  the best approach for this nation in just a few moments but let me uh  speak briefly in summary statement about my administration.  No.  I just have one short response.  Im not running against Mr. Ford. Im running for president.  Ive uh  used this opportunity to say what I believe.
What is your plan to manage inflation and ensure economic stability?,"Well, I think you said manage inflation, and thats probably the primary concern. Inflation today- when President Ford took office was over 12 percent; its now approximately 6 percent. Although, Im sure in the last period of time your own household has noticed a great spike as the results of OPEC. Were now working with OPEC to see if we can get a comparable kind of production from the North American nations, which President Ford has been subservient to OPEC instead of asserting American leadership among the American peoples and around the world. But this is the essence of it. As you continue to get increased productivity, sell more goods for the same amount of labor, you increase efficiency, you take away this major spurt in inflation; you also help create more jobs."
How will you create jobs and reduce unemployment across the nation?,"Well, first of all, in order to have an unemployment rate in the single digits cleanly and to have a full employment economy, we have to have a GNP growth of 5 percent or more for two years running. Speed of motor has created some jobs this time[music in the background] lets people go through the neighborhood, visit and talk with one another. The other thing that we have to do is to put together a program thats very attractive for modernizing businesses. Now President Ford has made an attempt to do that with his 10 percent investment tax credit. I believe his proposal in the last two weeks of 10 percent investment tax credit for new plants and equipment, plus a 40 percent manufacturing deduction, is a very good one. There was no jobs program in the Ford-Carter debate four years ago, and if Congress hadnt over-rode President Fords veto of this jobs program, 15 million jobs on a cumulative basis would not have been created. Now, in addition to this, a metropolitan security program, where distinct major cities will be supported with federal funding in order to modernize our railroad systems, rapid transit systems, parking lots, and things of this kind, I believe will also help to nourish a growing employment opportunity in the metropolitan area."
What steps will you take to balance the federal budget and manage the national debt?,"Well, lets get right back to those generalizations. The first call he made was 700 billion dollars in tax increases to balance this budget, and then he made a special call to cut Social Security. You know, Ive watched people play politics with the Social Security trust fund. If you want to talk about a real crisis in this country, its that the system is broke. And if you start taking that trust fund and using it to cover up the deficit, weve got a real crisis. Thats a promise to the American people that, Mr. President, you dont keep. And I Promise Ill never play politics with it. And when youve doubled the national debt in 4 years, weve got a whopper of a problem."
How will you ensure that all Americans have access to quality and affordable healthcare?,"John, if I provided a simple answer to that question, I think the American people would know that your question is actually far more complex and would require more than just that simple answer. But let me try to answer it. First, clearly weve gotta control costs. No question about it. Twenty-three percent of all our nations economy devoted to health care is an outrageous figure, and its gotta be brought down. Second, everything that Im aware of suggests that the HMO- managed care term is accurate. If its managed, if its efficient, if its human, thats fine. If its not, then its not. But if we can control the costs that way, we still can provide options for the American people. Third, we surely have gotta provide for those at the bottom. No question about that. Thats what the catastrophic bill of 1986 was all about, at least for middle-class families, so that the well-off and the already well- insured Americans would not be the only ones to benefit by it. Weve gotta have a means of controlling costs that is fair and just. Finally, Im absolutely determined that we do everything we can in getting the Federal Government to set an example. Yes, I will end the cross-subsidization between companies with union labor, where the employers are paying 70 percent of the health-care costs, and those companies without unions, where the employees are paying 70 percent of the costs. It distorts the total package agreed on between employer and employee, and its unfair to those workers without unions. Will I end Medicaid, or will I end Medicare? Absolutely not. They are two of the most successful programs created. But let me be very clear: The secret of reforming health care, the ultimate solution to bringing the enormous cost down that we now export overseas and cause inflation here, is to have universal coverage."
How will your administration address the pressing challenges of environmental sustainability?,Have you bothered to compute a little basic data on the United States? Our population is expected to grow from 240 million to 300 million. Were not talking 125 years when our population would need to stop. It will be doubling in less than 50 years. And this is what you call an environmentalist party? Thats a party wheres fascinated with the idea of sustainability. Everyone should learn the definition of sustainability. Were out talking in terms of environmental sustainability and theyre talking in terms of political sustainability.
What are your top priorities in regards to foreign policy?How will you strengthen America's national defense and handle relations with adversarial nations?,"Response to strength by entering arms control is a very responsible out and its one that I intend to continue to do that. Weve entered more countries into arms control, Soviet, China, Poland, Czechoslovakia Have we entered more countries into arms control. Weve entered the inertia so they were getting this hard work. And this is so terrifically dangerous.  You wont have. No arms control. Im not a isolationist and futurity. Im not a weak leader in future relations and our comparative defense and strength in my lifetime and nothing he can do and modern weaponry is so dangerous with the Soviet Union. I know what it done. We will compete. We will modern or what they do. How he knows all about the Soviet Union strength and purposes. Its my experience that you have shifted your camp fortresses and with strength are not an added security. You have to  with strength. And with your purposes. The more you show strength, the more they respect in my experience, Ive dealt with the Soviet purposes. I know emblems, Ive been every hundred nations. Its terribly, in swords."
What reforms would you propose to improve the education system?,"That would probably take a second debate, because I could go on for a long time on that. The  in one minute, let me say that  the first thing I would do is decentralize. Eighty-five percent of our school districts have fewer than 2500 kids in them. Theyre governed by their boards, not by the state or the federal government. And we ought to hold the boards accountable for excellence in education. Secondly, I would remove the federal government from education, as has been said before  and I would like to have a minute after this because I inherited 10 minutes that he inherited 1. But  and then give responsibility to the states. And third, I would give responsible, generous scholarships to all young people who need help going to college or university. I would not let those scholarship funds be hindered by government. My alternative is the maximum feasible private foundation in our country for the future, that will be an explorer of excellence in a dead-end field."
How will you restore trust in government and ensure transparency in your administration?,"Well, first, I think you have to have faith in the American people; give them the facts. When I became Governor in Georgia we had a terrible situation when Governor Carter went out of office. There were six lawsuits against the State, the State had just been in a court receivership because of the fact that the legislature had failed to pass a budget, there was absolutely no cooperation between the executive and the legislative branches of government, the financial affairs of the state had been mismanaged, and there was a feeling of uh, frustration uh, within the state government. What I did was just get the facts. As soon as I was sworn in I invited the leaders of both houses of the legislature, the news media, uh, the heads of the state uh, agencies, those that are responsible to the executive branch to my office. I laid out the facts. Uh, there was a feeling among the people, and not only among the leaders of the state government, that uh, we were uh, better off to work together than to uh, fight among ourselves. I think this is what  has to be done in the Oval Office. The problems facing our government are so great, and the solutions of those problems, uh, depend so much on approval of the American people  which usually is reflected in the Congress, the Senate, and House. And I think to be successful what the president should do is to invite the people to the table. Not just in highly publicized press conferences held uh, once a year, but an average family in the White House once a week, the transcripts made available the next morning, the network and radio briefers, uh, who summarize the news and give the lead stories. This will enable the America people to be more involved in government, will give the American people the facts that they deserve, and this way we can  I think be reunited  the Oval Office with respect to the executive branch and the American people."
What policies will you pursue to ensure equality and protect the rights of all Americans?,"Theres no question that affirmative action has been an important accomplishment of our society in the last two decades. Mrs. Weinberg, like many other officers in the Labor Department, is carrying out an affirmative action directive, which specifically says that woman who is pregnant cannot be denied continuance of her job or the right to be hired in the future. Theres no question that this directive and this policy is being enforced. It ought to be enforced. And Mrs. Weinberg was absolutely right not to use her personally employed secretaries to write a brief which supported the Mr. Weber, who was a white male, who brought the action to court. Theres no question, too, that Mr. Weber suffered personal hardship because of an unfortunate accident in his life. Mrs. Weinberg and others employ in the Labor Department a substantial number of women and a high percentage of women, among their executives. Affirmative action must go ahead, and will go ahead in my administration. Weve experienced a return to the good-old-boy network in this administration. Affirmative action for women has solid support by the Democratic Party and by me personally."
How will you lead the country through challenges and unite Americans with differing perspectives?,"It looks like we have a minute, thirty. Okay, I need to go. As was just indicated, when I was governor of Michigan, it was a very troublesome time. I had the Vietnam War, the Mmerican Indian Movement. I had a lot of mine wars in labor. My father died in 1962, the year I ran. I had no money. My state was broke and I had to borrow $220,000. Those three traits that I have: I learned how to listen because I had to; I had to learn how to make tough decisions, even though you knew you would never please everyone and that still goes on today mine; and finally I had to learn how to communicate because everything would be a code or something and I had to learn to speak clearly, honestly to the people. Thats what I did as governor. I think I did it well and Im certainly going to do it for this nation from here on out."
"What is your plan to manage immigration in a way that balances national security, economic needs, and humanitarian responsibilities?","Well, first all, I think that you have to speak very frankly about immigration. And that is, first, and without question, we must know who is in our country. And if you say were going to control immigration, we have to control illegal immigration. These are people who have gone through all the suffering, who are in this country, and we dont know whos here, and its dangerous. And so what I would do is, first all, Id enforce the law thats on the books. The law thats on the books says that if an employer knowingly hires someone whos an illegal, that employer does go to jail; that employer does pay a fine. And it is known, and therefore that would help control all this hiring of people. The second thing is this: The terrible backlog for those legals who now want to come into our country is terrible. I believe the ratio is four in the criminal, and the other is 140 years before the waiting lists are cleared up. Whatever work were doing in those countries, were not helping do this, so we have to make sure we work our embassies and we do some testing so that those people who want, who are angry that it takes so long to get here, that we can do a better job. And then were honest about our borders. We let the Border Patrol know, they know whos there. We let them know they need help. They cant do the job entirely by themselves. We allow our ports to be reasonably checked so that we know who comes in and who goes and our ships. And we have a basic amnesty bill to those people who have been here a long time, who have been working here. Theyve paid their taxes. They dont speak the language. Theyre not criminals. They have a way to legalize themselves. And that way we move ahead as a country and we can smile and be proud of all of us.
"
How will you ensure equal opportunities for marginalized communities in our country?,"In my administration  I have a  uh  record of bipartisan cooperation. I have worked all of my life not only with white Americans, but also with black Americans and brown Americans. And I have a proven record of having drafted and pushed through the Congress major civil rights laws that have kept the uh  out of the voting booth white and black, that have enabled black Americans to gain the right to public facilities where they had been locked out previously. Since I have been in the Congress and now in the White House, I have seen more black Americans elected to public office than in the history of this country; I have seen the biggest income rise among black Americans of any president in the history of this country, and thats true also among Hispanic Americans, and Indian Americans. Ive seen uh  black Americans gain more in enrollment in colleges and universities than in previous administrations. Every year since Ive been in office was a record year in employment for black Americans. Weve also worked closely with Puerto Rico. For instance, in the financial assistance  bills passed in 1981 and 1982, we saved Puerto Rico more than six billion dollars. Im a firm believer that you can promote a strong American spirit with a guaranteed opportunity for everyone, without special privilege for the few or without penalizing those who do well in life. I think that every American should have a chance in life to make his or her maximum contribution. When thats done, we all benefit. This is an ongoing effort. Our leadership is recognized by most Hispanic Americans, of course, and by most black Americans. And Im dedicated to giving them every possible opportunity in life thats uh  within the power of government."
Why do you believe you are fit to be the next leader of the United States of America?,"Because for more than 2l years, Ive been preparing for this job as governor Ive dealt with partisan gridlock, Ive done it with, among Democrats, a great diversity of opinion, I have worked with and for the people, I have learned how to solve problems standing up, facing the American public. Ive been trained, haft to say, by living for 17 years in an automobile. Ive been to every corner of Georgia, I know the American people personally, and I feel that I am ready for this job. Theres no experience I can gain in the next 5 weeks that will make me better qualified. Im of the age  Im 52 years old  Im of the background and training and experience that meets, I think, in a summary, the purpose of the founding fathers in giving us, in their estimation, the minimum qualifications for president. And I am a steward of this nation for the future. Theyve given me the opportunity to hold this position for my term and I hope to be re-elected. But what I do today will affect the generation of Americans in the year 2050, approximating the 300th anniversary of my nations birth. I am a steward now, holding this office in trust for the future, and with all of my background, experience, humane instincts, and having been trained for this job, I feel that Im competent, capable and committed to do whats right for my country."
What is your overarching vision for the country?,"You know,  Ive debated  oh, maybe forty-five times in my public life  and Ive never before had uh  quite that demand or uh  requirement in a debate to know each candidates vision for the nation. I hope the American people will judge me by my record, the positions that Im advocating, and what Ive achieved. I think Ive proven that I can lead the nation in a way that brings about the fulfillment of a good life for all our people. Let me say that I dont change just because Im pointed with the finger of accusation or a demand for simplification. Ive tried to answer all your questions as simply as I could, but I think the American people deserve more than just some simple definition of a vision or a slogan. I think theyve got to look at the record in the past and the commitments for the future. I think thats what this campaign, and all my debates, have been about. And I intend between now and Election Day to keep letting the American people know what Ive done, what I believe, where I intend to take the nation in the future."
What is your plan to manage inflation and ensure economic stability?,"Well, if hes going to stop throwing darts, Ill start answering questions."
How will you create jobs and reduce unemployment across the nation?,"Ron, uh, unemployment is a complicating uh factor in an economy and its often times, uh, very, uh, hard to deal with but I feel weve dealt with it effectively. Let me say  let me say this  I think we got to take advantage of her possibility in the private sector of our country as I have over the last six years with 10 million new jobs. Now the uh, uh  forecast for out there in an average forecast is that they will be a million new jobs created, between now and the end of the uh  opportunity period, uh  for my prediction, with adequate uh  predictions, with adequate control of inflation and adequate stabilization, I believe we can have as much as a million and a half  to two million new jobs. That would take care of a lot of the problems. The uh, uh  women in the factories, the marginal farmers who need help, people who need additional  additional Help because of a tax cut, all of these things can combine together to minimize this. The essential thing, though, is to continue our present policies that produces more production, that makes it easy for people to find jobs."
What steps will you take to balance the federal budget and manage the national debt?,"The President is counting on $500 billion in growth over the next four years. Theres no evidence to support that whatsoever. And as a matter of fact, the Wall Street Journal last week, for instance, took a look at all the Presidents projections over the last four years into the future, and concluded that he got one right, once, in four years. He is pushing this enormous defense budget and thats the other reason we got that $200 billion increase in the revenues over these four years, attributable only to the defense budget, because of all the other things hes done. This $350 billion deficit plan that hes talking about means $110 billion tax increase, or, alternatively,  do what theyve done in the past: cut Social Security benefits, lower income benefits, cut veterans benefits, and that means it would have to be done on the spending side. Its like a joke on the American people; they dont come close. You set up an impossible target that no one can meet, and thats how you get your applause. Now, I was a part of President Kennedys administration, as you were a part of President Johnsons, and we faced this huge problem of trying to balance the budget under  an underperforming economy and no help from the monetary authorities and higher defense costs from the Cold War. Jimmy Carter came in with the biggest deficit  headed for the biggest deficit  in history, and we left with the biggest surplus. Herbert Hoover, whos vice presidential candidate, got a balanced budget  Coolidge got a balanced budget. They achieved it by cutting spending on the unemployed and on the disabled. So maybe Mr. Bush has his hero in Mr. Hoover. The fact of the matter is that you can do it, but youve got to restrain defense; you have to accept lower interest rates so we can get that growth; we have to require the wealthy to pay a fairer share; we have to turn around and lose that $100 billion trade deficit. Its all doable. But just announcing a plan without specifics is not going to balance the budget."
How will you ensure that all Americans have access to quality and affordable healthcare?,"California now has one of the finest health-care delivery systems imaginable. Our health-care system of the future under the plan that were enacting over the next five years will have the family secured with a family budget around which we can all plan. Prescription drugs will be included, hospital care  teaching hospitals  theyre all included; major medical catastrophies  theyre included. Why? Because only when the entire family is included  mother, father, children, grandchildren, the entire household  can we all sit down and plan the costs of health care and avoid when possible sickness requiring health care. The same as were doing in California. Fifty percent of our working people without expensive bureaucracies and all that were able to provide 50 percent of the working families in California insurance without government programs or subsidies.  We have now available in California for the first time since mankind existed, actuarial statistics on the health of our population. Well, underinsured like they do in Texas, as President Ford is proposing; well have equal health care coverage. We wont let people without money go to the private hospitals. Well have the semi-private, substandard hospitals for poor people. And well do away with plan like hes pushing. Its punitive and almost draconian in approach. This is a healthy nation. We ought to be able to have health-care costs which are modest by putting everybody together, making everybody responsible under the same budget. And the final result will be that well provide health care for the 40 million that we dont have it now for, health care for the 40 million that we dont have it now for, the 40 million that werent paying before, and the health care for the 40 million that we do now have it. And well use the increased improved productivity of the health care delivery system and everybody paying in to keep the costs per person down. Itll work, and well do it."
How will your administration address the pressing challenges of environmental sustainability?,"Well, first of all, I disagree with the basic premise of your question, although I accept the fact that were working off limited data. The facts that Ive given you on comparable costs in Japan and Germany are correct. If we extended the life of our fossil fuel-burning utilities by belatedly providing air pollution control equipment, those companies believe it would add something in the vicinity of between $4 and $5 billion dollars to the cost of the plant. We believe also that solar power will go ahead extremely fast. The rate of jumps in efficiency of solar conversion cells has been remarkable. We now have a major program underway, begun recently, to have a high-pulse, high-power CO2 laser, which gives an indication that we might utilize that in the very near future, within five to seven years, to provide a cheap way to convert fossil fuels into energy. Weve also begun an extensive program with wind power, which could also bring an indication of large-scale low-cost wind electric capability. We also believe that tide power, as one of a number of alternatives, will begin to show promise. Weve begun to do research and development on helium 3, which is one of the rare isotopes, if not the rare isotope, of helium which is found on the moon, which, theoretically at least, might some day provide an excellent and cheap source of power. In addition to that, we have the nuclear fusion power, which, of course, is many years down the road.  We believe all these things joined together, plus the potential for conservation, would indicate that we have a tremendous success ahead in changing our energy supplies in a way that will not destroy the environment and will not, therefore, cause additional food prices increases, because the use of coal-trying to increase the use of coal by eliminating the air pollution control requirements on coal-burning would, of course, involve very seriously jeopardizing environment. And thats why these companies would not do it to start with.  Its also why we think our Clean Air Act Amendment Program should go ahead very rapidly. Most experts believe that we can reduce air pollution in this country, including very markedly the sulfur-dioxide content, without additional use of coal, and maybe even putting some new stringent quotas on the use of coal. So, were able to move simultaneously toward a cleaner environment and at the same time, a vastly enhanced energy supply system.  I believe that this will be the case. If Im reelected, the context will be completely different; there will be a uniform program across the board. The control requirements will be established, and the utilities and the system can operate efficiently. There wont be all the additional costs that have now been imposed, all brought about by this whipsawing exercise. I deeply hope that Im wrong and that we would not have any major electric power disruptions, but a number of experts have predicted that if we keep this energy program going according to the current schedules, we will have major electric power outages in the next few years.  We believe this also is wrong. We believe it can be controlled. In fact, our original plan was to reduce by 2 million barrels a day, the use of imported oil, and we far exceeded that: we went to 3.6 million barrels a day reduction fairly rapidly. We believe that this can be correctively controlled also by a uniform and sound energy program. Each of the factors that I listed would contribute tremendously-an increase in the availability of energy to this country and overseas, plus a decrease in the use of unwanted fuels such as oil, plus a decrease in energy use by enhanced conservation techniques, would all be to the good, and I think that with the joint teamwork efforts of a governor and a president who are knowledgeable in these areas, we can move very rapidly toward a successful adjustment to a non-inflationary, lower tax, increase in jobs and upward moving society."
What are your top priorities in regards to foreign policy?How will you strengthen America's national defense and handle relations with adversarial nations?,"The first requirement of a president, the commander in chief, is to keep the American people safe. And I think that a president must clearly define his priorities with respect to defense and exercise that responsibility over the Joint Chiefs and the secretary of defense. Not just accumulate power, but to insist that the power be used, that the capacity for war be  not to wage war, but to prevent it. There must be a deterrent force. The second requirement is to see that we eliminate the chance for nuclear war. A no-win chance for any war. And the last war, which we would lose in any event, is a nuclear war. There must be a reduction of those nuclear warheads. And a president also has to pursue a foreign policy that is not only a continuation in the Baroque sense, or a balance of power policy in the traditional sense, but must be a moral exercise. No president can be great just because he governs well and commands a great army. Thats what a dictator does. Anakathesis between th power of the presidency and the people must be given to the people, so the presidents great exercise of power is to release the power of the people so they can reform their society."
What reforms would you propose to improve the education system?,"Let me turn on the bright light and title this meeting, The Dummies Guide to Education. No, thats not fair. But let me tell you this about the education system of this country. For twelve years we have tested our kids in  uh math and calculus and weve given them boards. Our  our teachers have been trained in not ubiquitous uh administration but instead in how to work with our children and the governmental policies with respect to education have been flabbergasting. For  twelfth years running, long before the one percent cap on the income tax and long before the  kinds of welfare, so-called municiple charity turun, we have been giving one hundred and fifty billion dollars worth of scholarship grants, loan programs, work programs, tax credits, uh uh uh  [BLACKOUT]"
How will you restore trust in government and ensure transparency in your administration?,"This has been a tragic evening, because we started with hopeful feelings about tonight, and they fact that we could demonstrate a real contrast between ourselves and our opponents. But this last exchange has brought all of us down to the past, and not able to concentrate our future. I dont know how I have somehow lost the trust of the people. I feel it in my heart; it hurts me deeply. Ill tell you one thing: my Mom used to say, she said, Jimmy, you tell the truth. And if people get angry at you, thats their fault. Well, Ive done my very best. Im gonna tell you the truth. Im not perfect; not everything that Ive attempted to do has been successful. I made mistakes along the way. But Im going to try between now and Tuesday to show you beyond any doubt that what I say is accurate. And Im going to hold a news conference tomorrow, and every day leading up to election day, and Im going to do my very best to answer every question that you have to your satisfaction. One thing that we have tried to do for four years is to have a government thats unlike any youve ever seen in the past. I can also say this: with a complete air search of the North Atlantic, we still cannot find a plane that Ive ever flown. So if you try to go from the charts, thats not a good way to go. I think that were not perfect, with fewer mistakes. But in my view, between now and when you have to make a decision, I hope that Ill be able to do the same things that Ive done up to this time, and that is to tell the truth."
What policies will you pursue to ensure equality and protect the rights of all Americans?,"I think that the first requirement is political courage, and a willingness to make difficult judgments. For many years now, since  the mid-1960s  we in this country despite Republican opposition have had a bipartisan commitment to civil rights, to human rights, to the equal rights of women, to the protection of groups in our society that are disadvantaged, poor, and to the reasonable expansion of the welfare net  not as a permanent burden, or an indictment, or a description of our nation, but as a basic protection of our  human rights. Mr. Reagan has not shared that commitment, and we see it over and over again in his leadership. I believe that a President must lead with courage and not turn over the country to the special interests, which is what Mr. Reagan has done. He has loaded the Cabinet with people who oppose the enforcement of civil rights legislation, who have been overt, either in their statements or in their philosophical commitments, in opposition to Affirmative Action. He has tried to eliminate the Department of Education, and quite frankly, its  its insistence on equality in education opportunities for women, and the handicapped, and minority people. The  the nation is better than this, and a President must lead, and I think that my experience in the Georgia legislature, and the governorship  and Im not talking about political courage in a partisan, narrow sense  but for the service principled leadership of all the people, as contra-distinguished from the special interests and the wealthy. Thats the primary duty of the President."
How will you lead the country through challenges and unite Americans with differing perspectives?,"Yes. Well, I think that in the debates, that uh answers questions posed by uh uh Helen Hughes, who is uh uh my proposal for these debates uh  the Commission on Presidential Debates is necessary so that you wont have these little theatricals, but you will have a chance to respond to the other persons comments. I have a statement thats uh  brief, and Im happy to make it."
"What is your plan to manage immigration in a way that balances national security, economic needs, and humanitarian responsibilities?","There are two ways ive been talking about it: long term and short term  long-term action and short-term action. This administration inherited a situation where estimated by the former republican administration that 8 million aliens were living here. Theres no way to deport them. I think thats the correct approach. I landed on a compromise between Mr. Reagans approach and President Carter. I feel that we must have a temporary work card system. If an alien comes in here illegally, it can stay if his employer is fined for hiring an illegal. That way they take the job home. That approach also defends against the intrusion of other nations into our affairs, particularly Mexico, whose own economic problems theyre trying to export. Also, we are making great strides down in Central America. By giving economic assistance tied with humanitarian assistance and human rights, were able to create jobs in those areas. Therefore, theyll have less need to come up to this nation and perhaps make it across our borders illegally. Short-term investigations, of course, with the boarder control, those two aspects together will help alleviate."
How will you ensure equal opportunities for marginalized communities in our country?,"Under my plan  [applause]  under my plan to abolish the Federal wage ceilings, I will give those women and minority groups who havent been able to get in on the minimum wage increases equal opportunity to do so. I would also instill a requirement that diversity, equal opportunity, affirmative action, be included in the contracts required to be fulfilled, if the contractor has a contract with the Federal government. For instance, Mr. Fords  Mr. Fords position on foreign aid is to grossly cut it. Mine is to expand it, especially in assistance to the developing countries of Africa, because I want to see, as this young man said from Seton Hall, with equal opportunity for people in the developing world, we will have a much better environment, a more stable country, a chance for us to sell goods overseas and not be regarded as a pariah among those nations."
Why do you believe you are fit to be the next leader of the United States of America?,"I believe Im fit to be president  uh not just because Ive been trained, going to law school and being a public servant for forty-four years  thats important, but also the experience Ive had. Ive also had the experience of life; Ive struggled against injustice and understood. I went to South Africa when they were fighting apartheid, and I understood their struggle for freedom. When I went to Berlin, I stood at the Brandenburg Gate and I understood the struggle of those behind the Iron Curtain who are trying to get the freedoms that we enjoy. Ive reached out everyday of my life. Ive helped the poor. I was a juvenile court lawyer for a long period of time. I fought regularly in the big cities against city hall and I stood with the people, whether it was represented by the police or the firemen. And I understood their plight, too. I was the first president to represent all the people. I understood why the wealthy were wealthy. I helped restore the economy so the middle class did thrive. We had hip businesses out there that were functioning. I understood the importance of technology. We were the first administration in forty years to finish our term in office without a budget deficit. And we were the first in sixty-five years to cut the national debt, because Im not only a lawyer, I was a process and outcomes and oh, yes, Im an engineer. I understand how systems work and you have to understand the nature of problems and get the extremes out of there. You have to reach out beyond yourself; why you think vice-presidents  future presidents  we pick them because they can get along with everyone. I can do that. Ive reached across the aisle not just to my party, but the other party  never gotten in trouble the other party. Oh, yes, Im foreign born, but my families been here six generations. I speak five languages  I know. Theres not a culture on this planet that I have not had to study to gain the trust of am interview of our people. Yes, I am tough; my homework three times through. But I reach out, and I can work with all the people. But you have to be really bright, because its a complex time. And you know, you cant run symbolic politics. It aint easy."
What is your overarching vision for the country?,Ryan didnt mention republicans in that question.
What is your plan to manage inflation and ensure economic stability?,Do I get to answer the question?
How will you create jobs and reduce unemployment across the nation?,"Jobs are created in a free enterprise system by the investment of capital in an atmosphere where its profits are assured- and are threatened by excessive taxation or regulation or by inflationary spiral. The next president of the United States does inherit a situation unemployment, about 5.9 percent. But he has the opportunity and must do everything possible to bring it down even to 4 percent approximately by the end of his term. I think there are two primary avenues for bringing down the unemployment rate: one is to control inflation, and the second is to insure that the American worker is the most productive in the world. In the last 25 years American average hourly wage has gone up about 85 percent. But in that same time frame weve averaged about 40, 41 percent productivity. So theres been a profit funnel that has kept profits up in keeping tax brackets up. The worker is still ahead but not much. We can do one of two things, to get the same result: we can continue inflation, and that has forced productivity to be high, because of competition. Or we can do what Im committed to doing: control inflation so that we do not have the pressure of high prices, and that insures that both the employer or management sector share profits, and also the worker with a raise in that productivity. thats number one. And number two is to concentrate on two avenues in particular that every recent studies by all the major business associations, the Chamber of Commerce, the National Association of Industries, the National Association of Manufacturers, and so forth have pointed out can create the most jobs in a new way: international trade. Our trade balance has gone down so that about $60 billion a year goes to Japan in payment of debts. We can hold this trade uh money in balance, and hopefully achieve a surplus, by increasing our own exports and decreasing our own imports by about that same amount. This would create four and a half million new jobs in about four years. And finally, two, in the building trade. Every major engineering association has said, including the American Society of Civil Engineers, the National Society of Professional Engineers, and the Electrical Engineers, uh chemists associations, have said that we have a tremendous backlog in efficient energy use, conservation, recycling, retrofitting, and waste disposal. And if we pursue a vigorous commitment toward that, we could create eight or nine hundred thousand new jobs in the building trades again in about four years- additional to what weve already, uh achieved during this last year. This would have a very favorable impact in both employment and in industrial production, and I think would assure us of a balance on our budget as well."
What steps will you take to balance the federal budget and manage the national debt?,"We understand that the steps we have to take to bring about long range deficit reduction, eight successive years of it, and ultimately bring about a balanced budget, must start today. Both of us have said that in 1982, January, were going to begin to bring about a balanced budget; that means we have to bring about a $100 billion a year cut in spending somewhere, or increase revenue somehow, most likely by the internal revenue code revisions that well make that will raise wed make that would raise perhaps $12 billion. I have earmarked two areas for cutting: One is a 10 percent across the board cut in discretionary spending programs, and the second is a $25 billion cut in defense spending. Governor Reagan doesnt want to see any tax reform revisions at all. We disagree on that. He doesnt want to see the reinstatement of the oil depletion allowance or the investment tax credit. Thats the area of disagreement. But the area that we agree on is the goal of a balanced budget; the problem is when do we start? I say we should start right now, and well have it done in 4 years."
How will you ensure that all Americans have access to quality and affordable healthcare?,"In the life of this administration, 6 million Americans lost their health insurance because her employer dropped it. Were going along with that, apparently. The Republican leadership in Congress has already budgeted for their own high-quality health care, conservative court justices, and a big tax break for the wealthy. The wealthy are doing all right. What weve got to do is lift the low- and moderate-income Americans, especially those who work 40 hours a week. House Republicans just proposed a minimum wage that would have the beauty of restoring the buying power of 1956. That doesnt work either. And the latest sleight-of-hand out of this administration is the proposal that Republicans support a balanced-budget amendment to the Constitution. If its so good, why not practice it now? One last thing: Weve got to do something about those congressional committees that have put a million lobbyists on K Street in Washington to fight health reform. When I tried to finance health reform with a modest assessment on employers who dont now provide health insurance  which the business, small-business community supported, the Chamber of Commerce supported  guess what: THE TRIAL LAWYERS LOBBY, EASY MEDICAL MALPRACTICE INSURANCE REFORM LOBBY, AND THE HEALTH INSURERS LOBBY PUT A MILLION LOBBYISTS ON K STREET TO  TO STOP IT."
How will your administration address the pressing challenges of environmental sustainability?,"I want to ask about the Gramm-Rudman Act. First of all, why did you sign a bill that you said was unconstitution and, second, what will your administration do to uh remedy the problems that the action of the United States Supreme Court have made imbecilic?"
What are your top priorities in regards to foreign policy?How will you strengthen America's national defense and handle relations with adversarial nations?,"Ive given you a pretty full outline of that basic policy, but let me just repeat the headlines: Defense strength  for the first time in many years under this administrations policies we are building and with that strong defense strength we are committed to a peace that is enforced by that strength. All that commitment, though, must depend on a sound and viable and living economy.  The trade relations, alright, with other nations of the world, opening the political arenas. There is no question that we will face difficulties with the Soviet Union in the future and during the next four years. But there is no question, I believe in my mind, that this potential for disaster can be managed. We will most likely face an arms race. If the Soviet Union continues these frightening build-ups, we will be forced to make corresponding responses. The military strength  the Soviets will remain our competitors, and I think it wont be managed. And we will be thrown into the arena of competition. Competition fosters tension, and thats a time when there will be a dangerous instability. In regards trade, I think its good that we open up the political and human arenas. This administration has created a climate so that Soviet trade goods are more competitive on the world market than are our own, and our trade deficit gives the Soviets an opportunity to trade with the West and especially our competitors in the East, West Germany, in France and in Britain particularly. So we are clearly isolating ourselves in that area; the Soviets must be the winners, we must be the losers. Tension  the defense responsibility is the one unchanging obligation that a President must face. And terrorism will follow as a shadow to that great power rivalry, and our international interests will prevail and continue, and we will have to face those shadows with a continued, real, in-depth, high-tech defense community."
What reforms would you propose to improve the education system?,"I would reduce the role of the Federal Government in education. We just heard the Presidents reference to the disharmony and the differences between the various racial and ethnic and religious groups. Do you know wheres thats happening to a great degree? In our private educational institutions, wheres the Federal Government now requiring testing, and requirements that have never existed before, so the students  particularly the minorities  are not going to be able to afford private education anymore, where theyve been going to keep peace in the family. And that disharmony, wheres it happening? In our public schools, between the Title IX and the special groups and everything else. Weve got to give the control of our schools back to our local levels, to our teachers and our parents. Thats what was done in 1953 when we purchased prayer in the classroom. Goodbye education, all the standards went to hell. The Federal Government never corrected that at all. And for 20 years weve been falling further and further behind in an international comparative scale of education. Now, the Presidents enormous outlays for education  and I commend him for that  have gone into administrative pap. Theres no question. Ive gone through the reports. The American people got a raw deal with that. What weve got to do is weve got to give that control to tell our teachers the parents their experts, not the court, not the bureaucrat in Washington. I will give them the tools to get the job done. Thats what weve got to do."
How will you restore trust in government and ensure transparency in your administration?,"I was amazed to hear Vice President Mondale say what he just said: That Id just have to get the people back here that I had to fire. Thats comparing my desire for a  responsible, open government with that of Richard Nixon."
What policies will you pursue to ensure equality and protect the rights of all Americans?,"Mr. Mondale and I, if we are elected, will be bound by our Constitution, by our laws. We will admit our shortcomings. All of us have shortcomings, all of us as human beings still have far to go and well never fully achieve our measures of justice and liberty. But remember one thing. Each of these special-interest groups doesnt ask for anything special. Each one of them asks only for that those liberties, that pursuit of happiness, that quality of life that each of us  you and I  assume by virtue of our birth and by virtue of the greatness of this nation. That surely is not too much to ask."
How will you lead the country through challenges and unite Americans with differing perspectives?,"Every president in this century has faced a severe crisis. There have been two massive depressions, a civil war, two world wars, the Korean conflict, the Vietnam War. And every president, whether Republican or Democrat, has found a way to draw strength from that division and also to provide for a national leadership. I think the best  or one of the best examples in modern American history is President Eisenhower. He was a Republican president, he served 8 years under two Republican Congresses. But if you look at the Bureau of the Census, the two ones, the two sets of eight years that had the highest increase in minority  or in civil rights legislation was under President Eisenhower. Despite the fact that he was a Republican president, despite the fact that his party controlled the Congress, he sat in the Oval Office and as President of all the people provided a leadership that reached across party lines and across sectional lines. We desperately need that in the years ahead. There is no way in which one part  one faction of our country can try to dominate the other ones. We are all in this together. President Kennedy said in his inaugural address: We should not be fearful of a new era in our common history. Well, I am a southerner. I was born in Plains, Georgia. I went to public schools, and I went in the Navy. I served in the State Senate. I served in this body with the most precious legislative institution maybe in all human history. I have served as governor. I have done everything my potential as a citizen has allowed me to do. I am married to a very attractive woman whose grandparents came over from Scotland. I have a  I have a good family heritage. I think that if I am elected that every American will have had the same opportunity that I did to serve. I yd yes I stand for certain principles. We are having a crucial election. I am a Democrat. My very presence here probably concentrates focus on our party. Now let me say that I am not ashamed to be called a liberal. I am  I am proud to be called a liberal. But I am probably a liberal like most of the people in this audience and most of the people who are watching around the nation. That is, I believe in fairness and justice and compassion. I believe that wealth should be spread around. I think that energy is omnipresent and that there is no shortage in energy but rather a man-made crisis. I believe the same thing about natural resource and about land, about air, and about water. I am not a right-wing liberal. I dont like the way the energy situation has been handled. I dont like the tax credits for wealthy oil men and the tax penalties for poor low income families. I dont like the way we have had two massive cutbacks in our environmental protection safeguards. Im sure that you feel the same way. But lets not divide ourselves into two parts and stand in opposition. I think once this election is over with, you will see a restoration of the confidence in our nation, the unity of our people, and a feeling that all of us, regardless of rich or poor, or black or white, or western, northeastern, southern or midwest-neighbors, that all of us together are part of a great country and that we can do great deeds. I would love to have the chance to lead to that restoration of national strength and greatness. I think we probably now have a minimum probate chance with a President who can lead us. And if we can put our nation back up there on the pinnacle where it belongs, then that in itself will serve as an example to the rest of the world. We are not on that pinnacle today. We no longer enjoy the respect of the rest of the world. But I think to be great, we dont have to be mighty. I think if we set our goals high again, our foreign outreach and strength will be not one based on military power. Perhaps it will not even be a prerequisite of economic domination, but a cultural example of political and economic fairness and respect for the human rights is the best example we can set up for the rest of the world. Well, let my presidency be free of disgrace and let it be one characterized by a sense of hopefulness and not a feeling that we now hiring the police nation that we have to have to defend ourselves and our neighbors, but let us reach out in that way. Johnson used to call it the Great Society. If we can achieve that domestic greatness, if we can set an example for the rest of the world based on that, if monuments are not based on monuments of concrete, steel and aluminum, administrative edicts, and military might but rather in the attics of childhood, with the books in the our country, in the street corner, in the neighborhood community where families lived together and where citizens had the right to control the affairs of their neighborhood. If we can restore that, then I want to tell you that that would be leadership that might make us worthy to have once again that great honor to be called the leader of the free world."
"What is your plan to manage immigration in a way that balances national security, economic needs, and humanitarian responsibilities?","Youve just heard Mr. Reagan talk about the braceros. Theres 7 percent unemployment in Mexico; theyre not going to come here. He also just offered in the last debate to cut the quotas for illegal immigrants in half. I dont know how he expects to see this number go down, but we will have increased unrest. When we went to Mexico a few months ago, we were besieged, besieged by Mexicans who wanted to come into this country, and most of them were very good, solid, law-abiding people, and they wanted safe haven. This President—and Ill be glad to say that were going to fully implement the immigration reform bill; my predecessors did not. In the second term of my administration, we will fully implement the immigration reform bill, which gives us the opportunity to analyze and track who illegally comes to this country. We will also have additional border guards. We will also have additional computer systems to track this down. But these people are coming here for social, political and economic reasons. And in economy, while we have the present unemployment, these people wont be coming. But you know, when the Mariel boatlift took place, just a small number of boats or ships brought in over 120,000 "
How will you ensure equal opportunities for marginalized communities in our country?,"When I was governor of the State of New Jersey, I had inherent, because of the Court, uh, the Commission responsibilities the uh Bureau some things that I did that I was responsible for  but for  which I didn~t have the absolute responsibility for the  the outcome. Ah, I had a responsibility for antique parallel that time a program called 299. And in that case I found that um we were finding equal opportunity being afforded in the hiring of blacks and hispanics in the cases of   in the instances of private industry where government was an active partner. Ah, I found that in the trucking industry that was the same case that we found a  greater respect and greater  uh achievement in the goals of hiring among blacks and among hispanics again where there was involvement by government. The courts have done a great deal. The uh,   equal-employment-opportunity efforts by the president and by secretary of labor, have done much. What~s~ve found has  unfortunately  looked at the ghettos of a  of a  city or of area around a county or state prison. Ah, there we~re in~ter-,  the living standards of [o-oor] bordered on the life zones of those who~re confined to prison. Ah, What um, ah~  what we found [in the in] instances where there were no bond issued no contracts um, out for  by government, was a retention of all established patterns where um blacks and[awk] hispanics still are  aren~t hired. Now I think uh  equal em-  equal opportunity in employment would~ve been achieved to a degree uh by 315 or 316 of this administration uh Equal Employment op-Opportunity by    uh the courts and  involved with the uh president in the secretary of labor. I don~t know if  what step or if any step has been taken since uh mr mundays te  report indicated that very few people uh frankly were being hired in  in government because of this many bothered to  do something uh, to alleviate jalan[] conditions uh before there was bonding contracts for-  work uh, out uh-  outside of  of pr-  government .

Why do you believe you are fit to be the next leader of the United States of America?,"I came into this office 6 years ago as a novice. I didnt know that much about government. Every day  every hour  has been a learning experience. Ive had a chance to understand intimately how the White House operates, how the executive branch operates, how the Congress operates, how the Federal court system operates, and sadly sometimes how the news media operates. I believe Ive had the chance over the past 6 years to see this country in its strength, in its weaknesses; to see what we have accomplished together, you and I; and to recognize as well the deep emotional commitments which all of us Americans have. One, to let this country be free; two, to let our citizens have equal chance to fulfill their God-given potential; and three, to let this nation, in a peaceful way, be an instrument for peace in the world. Ive had a chance to lead this country, often in the face of severe criticism. I had obstetricians a couple of weeks ago saying that every time a baby is born alive, they owe my administration a debt of gratitude, because they blamed me while that baby was inside the womb for its difficulty in being delivered. It reminds me of an old story about a fellow who was crucified between two thieves. One night he dreamed he was due to get a medal. Time delayed had failed him, but hes still been an inspiration to those who came after him. This is the type of experience Im talking about. In life Ive also had my has a very happy one. I was reared in a lower middle class family. I went to school on loans and scholarships. I worked my way through college and law school. I try to listen to what people have to say. I dont always speak at them; I try to speak with them. I think that this nation now stands, both at home and abroad, in a very favorable and positive position. We have a chance not only to remain a great country ourselves and lead by example, but also a chance to teach others. Weve changed the climate of the world, since the dark days of Watergate and Vietnam. We now stand as a people who are respected around the globe. Our economic influence has been tremendous. Our military influence is one of strength. Our nation now stands ready to fulfill our commitments, our capacity, our potential; a great nation at peace, with a balanced budget, with people employed almost 100 percent, and at the same time ready to reach out to the future with new knowledge and new strength. I believe Ive learned from the past, and I believe in my own life Ive been well-rounded, and Im confident, knowing as I do, my own country, that Ive traveled across its breadth from Bangor, Maine, to San Francisco, and from Detroit to Miami, and having been a governor and a long-term legislator, knowing the government and the people well, both in joy and in opportunity, Im confident that I could lead our nation to a stronger future as Commander in Chief. Thanks."
What is your overarching vision for the country?,"You know, let me just answer it this way. I was sitting in the Oval Office when a guy named Paul Volcker, whos pretty well known in your circles, I hope, called me in and said, Im about to raise your interest rates to 22 percent, Mr. President. You may lose your re-election, but we have to do this. And you know why he did that? Because inflation was soaring all over the world, and interest rates went up. And every American who borrowed money had to pay through the nose. But we stood firm on the budget deficit, and its coming down. Now, the difference between me and Mr. Bush is, when he has a choice between economic strength and an election, he picks the election. Theres the difference. This distinctions between the two of us are clear. And with all respect to Mr. Shultz and Mr. Baker, with whom Ive worked for, and respect, Mr. Bush speaks  Mr. Bush speaks for himself. And Reaganomics 1986 was the way the President of our country wanted it. And it made a bad situation worse."
What is your plan to manage inflation and ensure economic stability?,"Nothing has ever hurt a nation more than persistent inflation. If you go back in history, every time we ve had inflation, we ve had unemployment to go with it, and we still have a terrible national debt. Inflation is a hidden tax, because people who are well off, they can protect themselves, and they ve done it. The poor and those on Social Security dont get automatically adjusted upward for inflation and don t have the capability of investing in a way that protects them, because inflation taxes your savings and income. Now, as far as unemployment is concerned, the best way to deal with the persistent unemployment this country has had for years 618 percent is to have a rapid economic growth, but that goes hand in hand with controlling inflation. I think that President Ford would find it impossible to balance that budget with that tremendous tax cut, which is part of his platform, plus the $40 billion he gave away with that spending package right before the election. And I believe he has no hope of managing the economy in the right way without going into a recession, which would increase unemployment further and would increase inflation even worse. If I am fortunate enough to be elected president, I will at least do what every business executive in this nation does and that is to utilize the President supremely interested in the economy to be involved in the management of it. I will have experts, competent people, who have demonstrated skills in economics working with me in the White House so that this nation can achieve an intense and desired rapid economic growth, combined with the discipline in the Federal budget that keeps the inflation rate under control. That goes hand in hand with a third prerequisite, which is a sound monetary policy. We got into this inflation because of huge increases in money supply. And we still have to have a sound monetary policy that lets money out into the economy so that economic growth can be achieved with a system that controls inflation. Under those three prerequisites, we can have an American economy that both grows with jobs for everybody and keeps the inflation rate under control. It will take hard work and a skilled administration, but I believe with that kind of partnership that the American people can count on, we can at least expect results."
How will you create jobs and reduce unemployment across the nation?,"There are two areas in which we can have a very good chance of reducing unemployment very quickly: One is through an im [sic] im finally implemented uh housing uh programs. The two million housing starts that are uh pledged by Jerry Ford, which will not be realized, would create 600,000 jobs. I believe we can do that by fifty or  75 percent. We can make a great start towards uh a revival of the housing industry, and this naturally uh contributes to the overall uh health  health of the economy and follows through on  on related jobs. The other area is through uh transportation. The construction uh transit systems that have been promised uh throughout our cities thats been stalled  stalled now for more than two years by this administration, I believe we can be realized. This would create additional uh  600,000 or more job opportunities. And in addition to this strong areas of employment, employment opportunities will  will occur in other parts of the economy. I do not believe that the so-called market mechanisms is the way to go. I dont believe that you can just wait for the labor market, uh supply and demand to determine when uh people will go to work and when the economy will be uh revived. I think that the uh  direct approach where the government can play uh a strong supporting role in a balanced life with uh a  a private economy is the best way to go. I dont favor uh the compulsory work experience, programs have been tried in the past with only limited uh success  success. I believe that a more general uh approach with uh the providing of adequate uh jobs, uh adequate work atmosphere, provision of education, uh training facilities, that this is the best way to uh achieve our  our national goal."
What steps will you take to balance the federal budget and manage the national debt?,"I said that I would veto any budget that didnt balance by the end of my 4th year. Now, thats a great improvement over where we are today. And Im going to tell the American people and you this evening what Im going to exclude from that balanced budget requirement: One, interest on the national debt; two, Social Security. I think its more important that we protect our senior citizens than that we protect wealthy people who have an influence in Washington. And third, the defense budget. Ive been criticized for this, but heres the point: I do not want to start an arms race again. It takes about three years to construct modern weapons. If Im not elected president, at least they wont have three years to build it. So those three things were going to exclude. We will then have no trouble balancing the budget and stopping the massive increase in that national debt."
How will you ensure that all Americans have access to quality and affordable healthcare?,"In the healthcare area, the President has recommended a ten percent cut in the Medicare budget for the next year. And that comes on top of a twenty-two percent cut thats been proposed for the last three years, in Medicare eligibility and in service and in direct payments. Also, in Medicaid, the budget proposed by the President, again, if recommended by me, would require from the state governments a ten percent decline or a ten percent contribution to the total Medicaid health program. This would require the state governments to look very hard for needy people  the poor, the helpless, the children, the handicapped  to make up the difference in the projected deficits that might be required by the Federal Government. The increase in the enrollment in corporations for health benefits has declined drastically in the past two years, down 12 percent from what it was in 1979. The medical inflation continues. The President has recommended the sale of the direct payment program of the health program of the Federal Government to private insurance carriers, and that would raise on a one-time temporary basis about $10 billion, but it would not cure the problem of the basic inflation in health care. While Im not in favor of complete personal involvement by law of Government in the private details of life and health care, I do favor the voluntary involvement of those who are concerned about the subject  the doctors, the insurance companies, the hospitals and so forth  in a frugality and innovativeness that can produce high-quality health care, which is available and adequate to the people, that is low in cost and is ultimately affordable. What I will do cannot, in a minute or so, explain or be understood by the American people. Its as complex as the budget itself. Every American, every candidate for office in this country ought to be held to the same standard: that they explain to the American people how they can achieve their results."
How will your administration address the pressing challenges of environmental sustainability?,"This administration has taken important steps to protect the environment. We have a beautiful,  uh, state park, for instance, down in, uh,  south Arkansas that was endangered by a permit uh,  given to an oilshale company that wanted to dominate, uh,  our state. And I have uh,  declared and the Congress has acted uh,  to preserve forever uh,  this beautiful, uh,  ground. The uh,  big fight uh, that weve had, the continuing fight now to remove the alaskan- uh,  oil- uh,  pipeline from rats and to protect the caribou from- from being killed off is another important step. The flood plain management- Act  that- that we have with the Congress is another step. One of the most, I think, uh, remarkable, uh,  happenings in my administration has been, in the last three years, a rebirth, a renaissance in American energy policy. When President Ford was in office, uh, and when I came in, we let, uh,  to go uh, our oil imports equal uh, the total American-oil consumption. Since that time, weve cut our oil imports by 9 percent. In the month of April of this year, uh,  our oil imports went down 22 percent from what they had been in April the year before. We now use more coal in two and a half years after I became President than we used in the entire term of Richard Nixon. The same thing is true in nuclear power, and even at-  the present time, we are-  rewiring our-  our steel plants so that we can use gas instead of- instead of oil. But we have a long way to go. Uh,  we are still, uh, 94 percent dependent on the combustion of some, uh,  fuel to power our automobiles. And this is a-product, uh, a  method, uh,  of- of powering an automobile that uh,  puts into the air an enormous amount of carbon monoxide, tar and soot. Is-  is- there is  uh,  an improved- `- improved method being used now in- in the  using computer schedules in our city buses and streetcars,  but, still, we have a long way to go. And  uh,  I think,  with our,- with our energy program, which weve just started in the last three years, and the- and- and the gradual change in the- in- in the type of power we use for motor transport, and also with-  erecting, uh, smokestack filters, I think well make a- a  strong effort in the- in the next few years to cut pollution that comes from, uh, private automobiles and buses and trucks. We have made great strides in the  in the housing industry with our, uh,  synthetic building material. A - uh,  also the- the anti-draft housing subsidy bills that have been, uh, passed by uh, uh, uh, the- the Congress and also the zipper homes that we have. Uh  we have  we have a very, very serious pollution uh,  uh,  problem today from oil spills. I- uh,  Im making a great effort, and we will continue through the Coast Guard and through uh,  uh,  the assistance  technical assistance to our refineries that spill uh,  prevention ought to be a- a major purpose of uh, our- our- our government. The toxic waste disposal, that you mentioned a few moments ago is uh- is uh,  another  uh,  very important-  uh, and very expensive and very, very, long delayed uh, uh, program in uh,  American- ah American life. Weve made some uh,  progress, but nowhere near, uh, enough. I briefed uh  just  uh  uh  yesterday, the- the- the heads of our- of our major uh,  agencies in Washington that are concerned with air and- and- and water pollution, and also with, uh,  resource- uh conservation, and with  and with open space, that this is- this is a- a- a  major project by my administration. And I wanna make a- a  uh- a brief  presentation to uh- uh, to the- the- the- the Maas family uh  who- are- are a-  uh-  geologists, engineers, consultants in- in this  in this field to make an appropriate gift to them.  If I could  Miss Martha, uh uh  618-page  and wonderful book uh,  on-  on- on water quality.  Uh, um  uh  I think uh, it would be better to wait to  would wait until during the uh, the uh, the  the uh,  break in the program now, Ill go ahead and  and  and present this to, uh, Miss- uh- uh  uh, Maas now. Uh, this is uh,  619 uh,  pages-  616 pages- 619- 619 616 pages of- of uh,  the- the  the results of a joint-  scientific committee on water, air and land pollution. This is- uh,  as I said before, the Committee of- on- on- uh, water uh, quality. This, I think uh, completes my- uh- address to this important subject, and  and thank you very much, Mrs. Haldeman for your cooperation on this uh,  giftümü"
What are your top priorities in regards to foreign policy?How will you strengthen America's national defense and handle relations with adversarial nations?,"There are three characteristics that mark any administration that I may become the chief executive of. One is strength, in American defense, purpose and the will to do that. The second is to stay at peace. I have no intention of going to war with the Soviet Union or any other nation. I intend to stay at peace. 	 73 Third is the ability to resolve differences and decisieve motions on both a domestic and a foreign basis with effectiveness and with swift execution of a policy laid down. Those are the primary obligations of any president. Weve seen over the past three years, that capability sadly misplaced. Weve seen a widening gulf between ourselves, hurtfully between ourselves and our friends. Our sm continued suppression of our own people in the Senate, with no significant opposition, in most cases, to Mosacov. treaty that has not even been avowed by our president as a final treaty yet, but has been recognized by the Soviet government as final. Thats a suicide pill that has been placed in our constitution, and our senate, by this administration. Its pity, its a pity that we tried to deal with the Soviet Union. to have limited, arms control or to limit efforts between ourselves and them. Theres an obligation on the president to do that, command and coordination of the departments of the United States government in the  uh  to stay at peace, but to have strewngth behind him, to  pursue, however, resolutely our unique American interest: the freedom of our people, the making of our children, the making of strength in our own economy chance. The  the only way to do that is to turn it inside out, have it led by a president committed to win back that commitment of the American people. Mr. Ford did 77 not stay on his yacht. He certifiably loony-tunes Mrs. Ford put him on it, but the rumors were so plentiful and so widespread that only a week or two ago in a debate, Mr. Ford said no once conservative thadever has been put on that yacht since; he said no one, no one leans or was tagged on my yacht, or went onto my yacht. They I  dont remember what t tag/pronoun it was; they was not on my yacht.

What reforms would you propose to improve the education system?,"The American educational system, once the envy of the world, has now had its reputation severely sullied in recent years because of the declining quality of our education, the high dropout rate, the lack of a chance for underprivileged young people to have a good basic education.  Our newly appointed Secretary of Education, Terrel Bell from Utah, has an outstanding record in education reform.  Mrs. Carter and I might add  this is one area in which my wife will take a very active role in the administration of the federal government  have already gotten together with him, and we have this week a new program for education reform, which will be implemented after the election, regardless of who becomes president.  But it will place a primary emphasis on improved quality of education, restored discipline in our classrooms, a chance for lower-income and disadvantaged young people to get a good basic education.  Parents and teachers will be involved quite effectively in the future in making judgments on their individual schools.  I favor also the introduction of computer use in education.  We have an award system in education now, a winners award-type system, in which those schools and teachers and students that perform well will be honored, and additional help will be provided where its needed most.  I believe these steps would be a great benefit for education in our country.  This is an area in which the federal government, in the past, has been a real leader.  In this administration, weve seen a devastating budget-cut program that has stripped education of the Federal Governors Award and many other privileges in the administration.  We have seen also a lack of a national education policy.  These things will change with the Carter administration out of office.  We will restore a sound, national education policy with adequate financing through the federal government so that high-quality education will be available for every American."
How will you restore trust in government and ensure transparency in your administration?,Am I not supposed to answer that?
What policies will you pursue to ensure equality and protect the rights of all Americans?,"Well, wait a minute. Im not sure Ive had enough time to answer the first question. Quit fussing with me."
How will you lead the country through challenges and unite Americans with differing perspectives?,"Well, the first thing  and thats a very important question. The first thing that it takes is leadership. It takes a will and a determination to bring Americans together. John Kennedy made a great speech in his inaugural address, but the one  the lines in it that probably had the greatest impact on America were, `With your help, I shall lead the country forward."
"What is your plan to manage immigration in a way that balances national security, economic needs, and humanitarian responsibilities?",I am going to go president. How do you remember everything?
How will you ensure equal opportunities for marginalized communities in our country?,"Yes. The disadvantaged in our nation are now being deprived of the tools that they can use to work their way into the mainstream. I believe in equal opportunity for all Americans. And this has been a goal of my administration from the very beginning. Barriers to equal employment in the workplace have been broken down by those who deny that minorities and women are capable of doing the jobs as well as anybody else. And in fact, the affirmative action program has worked, and the courts have ruled that we are correct in persisting with affirmative action to give all minorities, Black, Hispanic, women, Indians, everybody, equal opportunity in employment. And with the passage of the Equal Credit Act, this has also opened up to reassuring financing as a tool to minority businesses or women businesses that have been hampered in the past by denying them the opportunity to borrow money. In addition, weve also expanded through the small business administration opportunities for disclosure of loans, and we have a goal of 25 percent of all loans from banks by small  through the SBA to be made available to minority businesses. This basic thrust for equal opportunity will continue. And in the area of things like welfare, food stamps and housing, education, these tools have also been reduced heavily by this administration, and I would make sure they continue as well. Weve got to give our youngsters and others who are just trying to take the first step forward in life an opportunity to climb that ladder of success."
Why do you believe you are fit to be the next leader of the United States of America?,"Lets take a look at the situation where the American people have to make a choice between Mr. Reagan and myself. What he claims to be his philosophy or position as President is going to dominate this debate over the next four years. Mr. Reagan has objected to talking about the past four years that I served. I think hes partly correct in that. Ive been misquoted a good bit in that., and my presidency has been demeaned somewhat. But as far as the American people are concerned, Ive been vice president since 1981, and Mr. Reagans been president. Everything Ive done in the administration will be contrasted against his own; everything that hes proposed for the next four years will have to be evaluated, given what has happened in the last four years. And as the American people look at those four years, I think they will realize that Mr. Reagan has been in over his head."
What is your overarching vision for the country?,"My overall vision for uh or approach toward the country doesnt revolve around a plan. My opponent talks about the fact that he has a seventeen point plan. Every time he gets a point done he doesnt change the Seventeen, he just adds a bunch more. What I believe the nations approach should be is based on principles. These principles embody the values that youve mentioned: opportunity for everybody; fairness; a peculiar property that we have in America of being able to grow far beyond our bounds. We take a small crop and we have an unbelievable fruitful harvest and we share with others in the world who need food and we share with the hungry people in our own country. A peace thats based on strength. Thats not a rhetorical flourish, its a principle. A peace based on uness, based on integrity, a strength based on devotion to our own country not based on the philosophy of others. And finally an American people that are united, uh that only together can all of these inextricably intertwined needs of the country be accomplished. Those things embody my approach toward the job as president. This is a time for change in our country  a change in the leadership, a change in the policies, but never a change in the principles, values, and ideals that undergirded our foreign affairs in the past and that empowered our domestic life and made us the envy of the world."
What is your plan to manage inflation and ensure economic stability?,"Well, first of all, Vice President Mondale assumes Ive said this once, and Ill say it again. I have never, ever suggested that we have a relaxed monetary policy. I have always said, and in fact, the majority of my speeches in this campaign have been addressed to the questions of the budget deficit, management of the trade balances, increasing exports. All of those things combined slow up the level of inflation. And of course, the comparisons that hes talking about, the two and two doesnt add up. I assume that both in Western Germany for instance and in Japan, you both have had  the  Ive never seen in any of the studies Ive read, have you ever had a policy of relaxing credit or relax monetary policy? I dont think so. And yet both countries have managed to have lower unemployment, and Its certainly quite possible to have growth in this country without a level of inflation of 12 percent. That cant be a starter. What I talked about also was the commitment to start paying down that debt. Vice President Mondales own boss is committed to it, his Commission on the Budget has called for the balancing of the budget by the end of this administrations term. Thats one of the things I strongly believe in. And I have every reason to feel that our revenues are going to continue to be as they have in recent years, somewhat higher than expected. In fact, if the tax  if the Congress had passed my tax relief program, wed still be $16 billion above, with current revenues, $16 billion above current projections in revenue collection. Thats a good thing. Well, get good things and bad things, and well have to get control of meddlings with both the spending side and the revenue side. I also think that dealing with the unions, we ought to have a national wages productivity compact, so that if the unions are willing to work with us in having productivity improvements instead of an added, say cost of living improvement, they dont get hurt. Taxes dont go up, and chances are well end up with a lower level of inflation. Those are just a few of my options. But I certainly would never try to play with money. That would be the start of all trouble."
How will you create jobs and reduce unemployment across the nation?,"One of the most critical needs now in the United States is to decrease the unemployment level by at least two million jobs in the course of 1983. We have planned to do this in a very direct and simple way, to increase manufacturing output, increase productivity, to meet the demands which will exist in our economy. One of the prime methods for doing this is through initiating and adopting a brand new energy policy. This year we will spend about $65 billion to $66 billion on importing foreign oil. Every $1 billion that we spend overseas for foreign oil costs about 30,000 American jobs. If we stay with the same policy next year, well spend about $100 billion on importing foreign oil. That means we would lose another 1 million jobs. This is not acceptable, and this is one of my resolute  resolutions that I have distinguished from Mr. Reagn. He wants to stay with a similar, if not identical, energy policy that we have pursued in the past. This would mean that we would continue to import foreign oil or to purchase it from OPEC, or elsewhere, at astronomical prices, and therefore lose additional jobs. Its a sensible thing to do to have a real energy policy that cuts out the waste, that stresses conservation, that puts into place a program that promotes these alternative, especially synthetic fuels, and that also pursues an emphasis on solar energy, wind power, and another risk on research and development. This can be a 5 or 10-year program, but if we dont start it now, its guaranteed to fail, and well have no additional jobs as a consequence. Also, our tax policies have been set up now to benefit mainly the affluent in our country. And, this is typified by the use of the so-called Accelerated Cost Recovery System, or ACRS, where huge corporations can take off an immediate deduction, and often receive a refund, because they have deduced spending in a year on taxes far exceeding the profits ma our multi-national corporations. This also needs to be changed, because we want to emphasize and give strong impetus to the small businesses, the small manufacturers, who have been the traditional job creators in our country. Its a very simple, direct way to add at least two million top jobs by changing our tax code and pursuing a real energy policy, and that is what we had intended to do in the future."
What steps will you take to balance the federal budget and manage the national debt?,"The last four years has seen the biggest  nonstop increase in our national debt in the history of our country. In the last four years, the national debt has doubled. When Senator Mondale was Vice President  when I was Governor of Georgia, the national debt was about a third of what it is now. And this year, we face an interest charge on that national debt of over $200 billion. The  thats enough to run the Defense Department and the Housing Department and the Education Department and the Environmental Protection Agency all put together. I have stated a firm commitment and record in the past that its essential that we balance our budget by the end of the decade. This year, with no recession, no major unemployment increase at all, the Congressional budget office estimates that we will have a deficit close to $215 billion, which will be about $16 billion more than estimated just a few months ago. Despite that huge deficit, every private organization that computes the economic future of our country has shown a growth prediction for our economy in the future. The average is an increase in GNP of about $2500 for every American family. With that, inflation gone, interest rates down, we ought to have no trouble at all in balancing our budget. The old catch phrases have come up again under the Republicans; spending and the Congress is always blamed. The assertion that taxes always go up has also been used. But this year, the estimates, the Treasury Departments own estimates are that there will be no increase in tax revenue from any source in government  at all, this coming year. Under the Democrats in the last few years, by 1980  Im being cut off  I must say 13 seconds."
How will you ensure that all Americans have access to quality and affordable healthcare?,"You said that we  both of us dont support the National Health Insurance program wh  which  I do support the position that wh- that  if you will give the people of California the opportunity to have quality health care, Ill guarantee you that they will be able to bargain together to have lower costs."
How will your administration address the pressing challenges of environmental sustainability?,Do you find yourself truly on track to meet 53 percent by 2030 with current policies? Are you at the 50 percent that Governor Dukakis said hed be at by 1990? Are you truly on track to meet what you say?
What are your top priorities in regards to foreign policy?How will you strengthen America's national defense and handle relations with adversarial nations?,Yes. Were being interfered with there. Fifteen percent is what Im allowed. And thats what Im gonna answer.
What reforms would you propose to improve the education system?,"Well, as you  as you must be an educator, because you challenged my statistics so rapidly. I wish I had it now. But the reason I quoted that is thats what was quoted to me by the local superintendent in the district I was in. I was in five different school districts that week. The important point is that the students themselves must have the opportunity to participate in the governance of their school. I also am an advocate of testing teachers. I have no complaints about teachers testing students. And I think that standardized tests for teachers who are going to be certified to teach is a valid procedure. I also believe that in the case of educational television and radio, thats a very worthwhile point. If you look at the high school kids who listen to the radio most, Jerry, thats not my kind of music. Its the so-called rock music. And in that type of music, educational programs are being arranged, are being spearheaded, and theyre more likely to listen to them if they come through the programming they like on the radio. But correcting the educational process in schools is one very minor part. Education is a very major element of my program. Let me just remind you that Im the first candidate in California to have released an economic plan in its entirety. In that address on education a week or so ago, I again emphasized the very high dropout rate in America, how it compares with Germany and Japan, whos about one in ten. Ours is one in five, approximately. And in the Hispanic and black families, its one in two. A second point is the inadequate teaching that goes on. A third point is correcting the fact of equal educational opportunity. In California, Im for Proposition 1, which would require equal expenditures per pupil for every school district in the state, despite local property taxes. Thats very important. And supplementary aid, as far as poverty areas and those with high minority groups, very important. The business community is more and more becoming aware of education and training. Less than 2 percent of our work force with less than an eighth grade education can read well enough to fill out a job application. This is the tip of the iceberg. Ninety percent of our future employment is going to require a high school education. Watching this, the business community themselves are starting to test their workers to make sure that they can read and write well enough. And the best-example that I know of best practices example is the Southland corporation, 7-Eleven. Theyve made voluntary efforts in this area, and their employees are much better educated, which hopefully they can move up in the company, they can get better jobs and so forth. So those are just hypothetical examples of how you would deal with deficiencies in the educational process. And its an important part of my economic program. And its one thing, one area of concern, that I have with the governors. The governors, as I recall, insisted, and Mr. Reagan has accepted their platform, that there be a moratorium on all new programs. To me, thats a rather moronic statement, to accept a moratorium on, one, things that you dont need to do anyway, and, secondly, on new programs that might be productive for the benefit of the country."
How will you restore trust in government and ensure transparency in your administration?,"I am very committed to keeping my commitments to the American people, and Im devoted to honesty and integrity in government. Ive found that in serving as governor of Georgia, to make major decisions on a statewide basis, I openly discuss these matters with the public. I take my proposed decisions, my nominees, my objectives, my proposed legislation, and I put it in the Georgia Gazette, that goes to every household. We invite the people to scrutinize what Ive put in there. I invite their comments, because if theres an error in my judgment or theres a better way to do it, almost all the time, Im shown to be inaccurate in my judgment or my information. And I learn from it and Im strengthened by it. I think this is a good opportunity for me to mention that my Republican opponent has asked for a series of debates. Im not afraid to engage in a debate with the Republican nominee for President in this campaign, and I welcome the opportunity to do so. I think it would be good for the American people and the-neutral moderator who is approved by both of us would be advantageous to- for the public to learn about the differences between me and Ronald Reagan. We will, I am confident, be working together in these debates and I hope we have at least two before the American people have to make their judgment as to who should be their President. "
What policies will you pursue to ensure equality and protect the rights of all Americans?,"I hear almost constantly from the people that I meet with that they want this separation\/ this division between the races to stop. And so I have also stressed the necessity for a continuing enforcement of the Civil Rights Law. This Justice Department is the most active Justice Department in enforcement of civil rights that weve ever had. The Fair Employment Commission under this administration has processed more  over a thousand complaints of discrimination in employment against minorities in this administration, under this Fair Employment Commission. We have convincingly demonstrated that through affirmative action and other procedures these statistics that have misled so many people can be altered. In the administration that I succeeded, 1974, 24 percent of all blacks who graduated from high school graduated  high school with a grade higher than their parents had. In 1977, the year I took office, that was only 14 percent. In 1976, in the national SAT examinations, blacks improved their scores 10 points, whereas whites score  unchanged. In 1977, a black who graduated with a university or college degree had a 10 point higher grade average than a white.  When I took office, the average salary of a black who worked for a living was 61 percent of that of a white. When I leave office it will be at least 74 percent. So we can do these things in an affirmative way  with the cooperation of everybody, without an antagonism between the races. And I, uh, I have  I will have and have had and also will have now and in the future a continuing strong commitment to a fair administration of civil rights in this country."
How will you lead the country through challenges and unite Americans with differing perspectives?,"We as a country will be able to transcend our problems. We face, in the coming years, the most awesome perils-challenges-which any nation has ever confronted. And we need a national commitment. We will have to craft a consensus among the American people. We will have to set aside the things that divide us now, and concentrate on that, which is most important. One-fourth of our population now lives in poverty. This is an abomination. Twenty-five percent of our people get 4 percent of our national income-while the richest 1 percent get twice as much, per income-tax return, as the poorest 50 percent put together. This is a demonstration that as wealth is concentrated, as power is concentrated, political power flows to the same kinds of people. And the voice, and the hope, and the inclusion of so many Americans single mothers and their children, black Americans, and brown Americans, and yellow Americans and the aged retirees on small fixed incomes-whom I hope I can represent in this campaign-are now excluded from a meaningful role in our country. This overwhelms us with a moral challenge. We have to fashion a consensus that brings the voices of all Americans alive."
"What is your plan to manage immigration in a way that balances national security, economic needs, and humanitarian responsibilities?","I dont see that I have to repeat myself on this. You asked me if I eviscerated the bill  the amendment that I offered in the House, and I said no. What I did is I took a bill that was put together by the  by the l- Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce. The Governor of California supported the bill. The U.S. Conference of Mayors supported the bill. The bill that I put together is a tough, tough bill on the issue of mandatory detention. Thats in the bill. The issue of economic necessity is there. We do during a labor dispute, for instance, if you have a dock workers strike and weve got Italian tomatoes, we dont have to apply that right to the employer. That is there. Theres no evisceration of the bill. Its a tough bill, but it was put together with input from state and local governments. I think thats what you need to do with immigration. If I might just add in my answer, I support the case of Guatemala and that statements that you referred to by the Nicaraguan families films that you referred to by the Nicaraguan families I supported those who were fleeing Honduras and Guatemala. I dont support those fleeing Nicaragua and thats what that statement said, and I stand by that."
How will you ensure equal opportunities for marginalized communities in our country?,"Well, first of all, Im  as I say, Im used to these one-minute responses and I can provide the answer that way. But if the Vice President would like to have another moment, thats fine with me."
Why do you believe you are fit to be the next leader of the United States of America?,"Im the only candidate on either side of this election campaign who has negotiated successfully with the soviet union at the highest level. Im the only leader whos been able to lose a war and still come back to keep this country secure and work on a long-range basis. Ive been in the Congress for a long time, as you know. I headed the National Governors Conference when I was a Governor. Ive been successful in every profession Ive ever had. And Im deeply committed, as this debate tonight demonstrates, to the needs and aspirations of my fellow countrymen. I care deeply about the American people. I have put and will continue to put my heart and soul into caring for them."
What is your overarching vision for the country?,"My vision is to have peace; to have prosperity; to have justice. I grew up in the South, Georgia, the land of cotton. And I saw, as I mentioned earlier on the air just now to President Ford, I saw much better days than what we have now in this country, and its because we dont have a commitment in our government from the President to the people to make our people live and move toward the idealism of the American dream. Its been a long distance since the rural south. I was born in a little tiny one-hoss town and but we have lost our way and this country can be better. It can be stronger, we can be at peace. My commitment to peace means that I dont wanna see this country dominant over other nations. I dont want us to be threatened by any other nation. I want us to be strong and be a powerful nation, but as a partner among all nations of the earth to keep  to keep the peace. This is my commitment Ive had since a little boy. I dont wanna see us drift farther down the road toward a war. And I believe that with a new commitment in our country toward justice, keeping our people free and maintaining the civil rights commitments that were made just 10 years ago. living up to our responsibilities with a strong nation protecting our independence and freedom, we can meet these challenges that lie ahead and restore a sense of unity and commitment once again among all the parts of our government and among the American people."
What is your plan to manage inflation and ensure economic stability?,"Well, first I dont think that you have to wait one to be inflation to destroy the economy. I think that this instance, as you just pointed out, Mrs. Smith, we have too much inflation right now. We are terribly behind in the management of this Economy. Weve got a hundred billion dollars in the foreign trade trade deficit weve got the highest inflation rate in the so-called Western countries. Its a disgrace to our country. We lost the confidence of the american people. And thats got to be restored. I think here its necessary  I dont think anybody says we gotta go to 12% inflation rate to destroy this economy. Weve proven just recently in 1979 and 1980 that it can be brought down in a 3- to 5- or 6% increase in the Gross National Product. I would work directly myself with the Congress of the US. In the past, Ive sat there for years with the um the Arab boycott; the uh grain embolus; with the oil embargo. Each time Ive brought together congressmen, senators, industry labor. Weve been able to get if not a perfect agreement, a sense of priority. And I uh would also take the 3000 participants in the last summit meeting between business labor and government and uh take what they have recommended and implement it. Weve got lots of industrial waste. Weve got 8000 factories that are idle. Those things uh can be quickly brought back into production. Um the major thing as you point out is the huge deficit Uh about $115 billion now. Its projected in the ten-year plan by the administration to be about $147 billion a year in 1987. That has a terrible impact . the tremendous load of money that has to be borrowed. The anti-inflation uh policies should c- concentrate against uh big banks and big business in opposition to the approach against the needs of working people. And also weve got uh prime interest rates now at 10 and a half and comparable to 12 and 12 and a half percent uh smaller loans. These uh all come together in a way that uh that will permit uh bring the cost of money down, the cost of government down, the export or the import burden down, and pressure on exports. Conservatively, uh I think we ought to have 3 uh to 4% uh uh increase in the gross uh national product growth and with that I think probably uh we could get inflation down uh below 4% around 3%, 2 5 percent. Now with that kind of approach, I think we could come up with at least one- one or 2% uh reduction in unemployment. The uh uh low rate of unemployment now puts a real hardship on labor working people, causes inflation cause it raises labor costs, and also places a hardship on tax- r- revenue which insists that expenses be cut, which has a further inflationary effect. That typi- approach, with uh hard work, with the wisdom we have in this country, tough negotiations, togetherness, I believe, we could achieve it. Keep uh grade inflation low, uh keep low taxation, and that would keep the cost of living down for an appropriate increase, if any, in the minimum wage. These things would help the poorest families in the country and in conjunction with that program, I think it could work."
How will you create jobs and reduce unemployment across the nation?,"Well, we have already committed ourselves to take those savings from the military and use it for two monorail systems on the West Coast  an all electric monorail system between San Diego and San Francisco and one in the Puget Sound area. We will probably use those same air buses from New Jersey to Washington. Also, we will expand, enormously, the Amtrak passenger rail service, which has, as you know, passenger cars on it, trucks on it, and maybe even some buses on them, with a modern competitive system involving the soft power, clean, safe, quiet power of rail, we think we can attract a tremendous number of trucking customers: truckers. That also will provide thousands of jobs."
What steps will you take to balance the federal budget and manage the national debt?,"Every president for the last twenty-five years has pledged to balance the budget and has only achieved that once. In order to achieve a balanced budget in future years wh youve got about a sixty-four billion dollars worth of cuts to make in this years spending plan, wh thats not going to happen. And Id be glad to give that list to you. Its like John Anderson whos running as an independent. He uses a proposal for a national sales tax, 10 percent whats called a value-added tax. That adds about fifty billion dollars to the federal budget. Thats not going to happen. He wants to get rid of subsidies. There are no subsidies. If there are, I want to know what they are. John Anderson wants to balance the budget without reducing military spending. He doesnt want to reduce benefits for social security recipients. None of those things are going to work. I dont know how you can do it, unless you did cut defense spending enormously, or you cut veterans benefits, or you drastically changed social security, or you eliminated Mediv or Medicaid. I mean Ive served as governor for four years. I know something about these tough choices. There are no easy ways to go, and Im committed to a balanced budget. My requirement is a balanced budget. I want it done without gimmicks, I want it to done without smoke and mirrors, and I want it done without somebody hiding a whole lot of money off-budget somewhere. I want a strong defense, I chaired Army appropriations and got whip votes for a balanced budget when I was the president of the senate. Ive got a record of that. But Im not going to go out and make pie-in-the-sky promises that I know cant be achieved under the circumstances in which we face ourselves."
How will you ensure that all Americans have access to quality and affordable healthcare?,"I am an absolute f  uh supporter of the public system in healthcare. To ve uh every American uh the opportunity for quality health care at uh at uh affordable uh uh costs. Uh now uh thats uh one uh system that uh I judge uh this Republican administration uh by. Theyve already been in office almost four years now and uh weve not had a comprehensive health plan developed. I uh in the first year in office if Im elected I will take the uh  uh the Congress in hand and f  uh submit a y  y comprehensive plan uh short of a national health insurance program that uh will uh uh let the American people have the uh  basic right in health care. To choose their own doctor, to choose the private hospital, to have uh  care that meets their needs. Uh  it has uh two basic responsibilities: one is the uh  uh  uh availability of uh comprehensive affordable health care for everybody, both uh rich and poor, it makes allowances for a lower uh  a  lower i  income level and i  enhances uh  uh the uh  payment of ah insurance and those in the uh  high uh  income brackets it gives them no tax free  uh uh uh allowances for uh  any health insurance payments. Ah second commitment is to uh-try to control the cost increases. This administration has been ah um  this administration has been uh fought  fighting uh  uh against uh proper health education and uh- uh  control of the costs. This is still  yet a fight ah  or an effort on my part that I believe is proper and necessary and Im sure the American people agree with me on that."
How will your administration address the pressing challenges of environmental sustainability?,"I live in a part of our land around the Great Blue Ridge Mountains, and the mountains of North Georgia, where the environment is still pure. We hope it will stay that way. Weve got to preserve our forests. Weve got to preserve our unpolluted rivers and streams. Our lakes have gotta stay clean. The purity of the air must be accomplished. Our estuaries and marshes must be preserved. Weve established a uh um wilderness preservation system, which is being expanded under our administration. Weve got about three thousand five hundred additional miles of the Appalachian Trail, uh Bush, when he was vice president, in thirty-seven different states, under the Heritage Conservation Act. Alaska Lands Act weve established a whole new wilderness area, the size of the state of South Carolina. These things must be protected. We dont have to protect the land, the land will protect itself if we keep our hands off, and this is a vital responsibility of every president. Whoever is elected in this election will be the first president since John Kennedy who has the authority uh to serve for two full terms in the election uh the presidency in the White House. And I realize that Ill be judged in the long uh historical viewpoint of uh the supreme leadership hand of our nation by what happens in these next three years. I plan to be out in the wilderness uh uh the mountains and the rivers and the lakes and the streams collaborating with the American people in the responsibility uh to preserve our land."
What are your top priorities in regards to foreign policy?How will you strengthen America's national defense and handle relations with adversarial nations?,"A couple of years ago, a very prominent German said that the year 1970 was the outline of American history. We became a superpower. We became as strong as we are now in our defense forces, in our technological skills, and in our economy. We had money and a sense of influence in the world. And weve never let that slip away, except over the last few years. My own life and my administrations plans are dedicated to let the United States be strong and simple, so that we can keep  and exercise that strength in a way that makes patriotism for our country meaningful. The barring of the Soviets from those parts of the world that deal with us is an obvious necessity. The establishment of a national pride will stem from three different areas. One is the strength in our military forces and the constant upgrading. I dont mean fanciful weapons systems that dont work. A second area is that we be capable of dealing with emergencies diplomatically or internationally that occur in the world. A third area is the establishment and maintenance of a balanced economy, seized with a purpose. Now, in each of those areas, we are falling down short. On our national defense system, the Defense Department, Mr. James Schlesinger has only requested or only been given 2 percent of the strength that he requested. Our navy is the weakest that its ever been. Our air systems are antiquated. Our army and Marine Corps strength is the lowest it has been since 1939. Weve not been able to modernize and upgrade our military equipment. In our overseas dealings, weve recently seen the United States exercising, for the first time in 40 years, no influence at all on the part of the nation that was threatened by outside forces. At the Olympics this years, the American prestige sank to one of the lowest peaks that its been since 1933. And in our domestic affairs, weve got a weak dollar, weve got inflation, weve got uncertainty in the balance of payments, our international trade is sinking into a deficit position for the first time in two generations. In all of these respects, weve seen a crying need to let the United States have a renewed leadership role in the world. And thats not been done. We cant do everything. But we should certainly correct all of these deficiencies in American life, and we should maintain a commitment to the underprivileged, the employee displaced by robot, the associated people in other countries that have to be supported, and the unprivileged and the folks still caught in the grasp of colonialism or communism. Those commitments are always with us. But weve got to stop the drift. And one of my primary objectives is to restore the United States to a position of peaceful, strong, and sensitive leadership in the world."
What reforms would you propose to improve the education system?,"There are several things that I would like to do in education to improve it. That is very important, needed very much, in removing, for instance, the social promotion of students in the elementary and secondary schools, as President Carter did with the minimum competency tests. This is something the American public has called upon us to do. We could move very effectively and obtain and appropriate very strongly the funds needed for remediative education for those who fail, not for those who pass."
How will you restore trust in government and ensure transparency in your administration?,"Well first let me say what President Ford just said is correct, that the American people are very skeptical of governments. What the American people know is that Im not a millionaire like he is. I dont share the interests of the wealthy in our country. And if Im elected President, Ill work for the people as Ive done all this year, and Ill do it frankly, in an open and honest administration that will be unlike those in recent years. I intend to have a White House, unlike the previous Republican administrations, where people are welcome. I intend to publish a daily record of visitors, so that every day the American people will know who has been in our White House. I intend to hold news conferences regularly. I intend to answer the questions of the news reporters without their having to negotiate with the White House the day before the news conference. I intend to answer questions openly. I think the American people are basically fair-minded people. Theres no secrecy or conspiracy in our government. If the American people know, and theyre given the information, I think theyll make the right choice. I also intend to have a cabinet meeting at least once a month, fully open and discussed.  I want the press to be there, maybe television also, so that every public issue that arises will be debated in the open.  A good example is the pardon of Mr. Nixon. I think what has happened in the past made the American people cynical. President Ford, as he knows, did not have a chance to submit that pardon to a direct vote of our people in an election. I told him then, as I told the American people, that I thought it was the right thing to do. But I also had an open administration, and Ill answer all of the questions before the administration and perhaps even after I would get elected, and then let the American people make their own judgment with me. I just think that the openness is the key. Mr. Nixon made mistakes. Mr. Ford tried to do the right thing, I believe, in humouring a man who was a friend of his. But thats not an open government, and I believe that this kind of an approach will make a tremendous difference in the attitude of government. In the past, Mr. Nixon tried to make everything top secret. Mr. Ford was even secret in his pardon of Mr. Nixon. But my administration will be one of openness, and I think that the people will vote fairly."
What policies will you pursue to ensure equality and protect the rights of all Americans?,"Yes.  You may have noticed Im not speaking about equal rights for women and equal rights for minorities.  Im speaking about womens rights and minority rights.  We have had in this administration a quite considerable progress for minority groups and for women, and as a matter of fact the womens movement and African-American groups and the Hispanic groups have conducted themselves in a way that has brought to the surface natural differences between us, and this has been recognized. Im not being critical of the womens movement or the minority movement. Im saying we have to pick up and go beyond the point weve reached today if we expect to have a united country where everybody feels a full-fledged commitment by the Government to the equality of participation. I believe also that there is in exclusionary zoning a way that women, for instance, who have got jobs, and poor minority families with a minimum wage or little-a little bit more than that, can go to the suburbs where they can enjoy schools and clean air and a lower crime rate and a good place to raise children. This is also the case in school with educational opportunities and in job opportunities as well. Furthermore, we really must stop this incredible job discrimination against women, which is now even in the Federal Government, and of course total discrimination against mothers who are trying to get a fringe benefit for their families by going to work. I think we need affirmative action, to be finished with affirmative action. Many of these groups are still way behind and need that assistance to catch up."
How will you lead the country through challenges and unite Americans with differing perspectives?,"Every president since Harry Truman has recognized that the conducting of American foreign policy has not only concerned itself with war and peace, but that it has been a means of bringing our country together. I have watched presidents do this when our nation was challenged from without or was bitterly torn from within. That edge[[?]] experienced because of high purpose has always cast its own glow on the presidencys leadership. American foreign policy under all of these presidents has been conducted in the light of the same basic objectives: To keep our nation strong. To keep our country united and at peace. To meet the challenges and meet the threats to our national security, to the welfare and health of our people, and to the advancement of our national ideals. But now we face a challenge from abroad or we are faced with the challenge of an alternative choice among ourselves. Should we regain that leadership in the democracies of this earth and among all nations of this earth with the exception of the Soviet Union? Or should we now follow a course that has been outlined by my opponent calling for a shrap[[?]] American withdrawal from trade, human rights, the environment, security, all of these into the confines of our own nation? I would prefer to see us have cooperation among the democracies, close consultation on technical and economic advances among ourselves, warm encouragement to those countries seeking the blessings of democracy and greater participation in government. Secret exchanges of the control of arms to at least know that our chances at warfare are less. But not down a less alert road leading to the South and to Asia and to North Africa, where we now have a vacuum for Soviet influence. What we are talking about then is a chance to strengthen America not only in economic strength but in the articulated ideals of our purpose as a people. No president has been successful who has not shared with the American people the knowledge, the challenges, the alternatives, the controversies, the open questions, so that when decisions are made they are made with the full knowledge of our country. And the challenge of the future is then formed together as one peoples, one nation, and we march forward to grasp the opportunities of the future with a commitment and a shared, bonded strength that is not possible in any other way."
"What is your plan to manage immigration in a way that balances national security, economic needs, and humanitarian responsibilities?","We have a very serious problem on our southern border with Mexico. In El Salvador, we have a country thats in real trouble. We have  60,000, maybe 70,000 people who have sought asylum and refuge in our country. This is different from any problem we have had in the past. These people are not going to be sent home when the situation in El Salvador is over with, nor should they be. We have a responsibility to work with that government and to work with our own foreign policy to settle that situation, to settle the situation in Nicaragua. And we have a responsibility to slow down the movement of those people up here, and weve worked at that. This president has sent arms and ammunition to El Salvador, these people have fought better, the situation has improved, were working at it, and, as I say, well continue to work at it. In addition to that, our border patrol is being improved. We need to give them the equipment, the tools to do the job. This president has increased their budget by about a hundred percent, not quite a hundred percent. I think it went from about 42 million to about 82 million. They just need the tools to do it. When we talk about immigration reform, however, what were talking about is we have some two to three million people here whove been here for seven, eight, ten years, some of them  25 years  illegally. Now, while we build the wall, or whatever we need to do to slow down the flow of people up here while we continue to do the job, we have to put these people on the path to legality. If we dont, were going to have something like 15 to 20 million people here illegally in the next 10 to 12 years, and well never be able to secure our borders. So we put them on the path to legality, then we build the wall. And when I say `the wall, now Im speaking metaphorically  its the toughness of the enforcement at the border. "
How will you ensure equal opportunities for marginalized communities in our country?,"Well, I think one factor thats very important, if one is going to be a leader, is to be honest. And if you are honest, that means that you dont use cliches or words just to get a cheap political shot at another opponent or to catch some votes to win an election. I was the first governor of Georgia, since 1872, to have a majority of the Senate and the House from my party. And we passed more legislation in my first two years, very controversial legislation, professional licensing, public accommodations, equal opportunity for women and minorities, then any other governor party  governor in the history of Georgia. And in the year I was elected, 1970, not one black person in Georgia or in the South served in a statewide or cabinet office. I had a black commissioner of corrections, a black commissioner of human resources, a black appointed to the Board of Natural Resources, Gitten, was the first time Georgia has ever had a black person serve in a higher office, a cabinet post. We have the strongest affirmative-action program, equal-opportunity program, in the federal  I mean, state government in Georgia, a business. We have equal-business-opportunity programs in the awarding of state contracts, in the lending of money through state banks. We have strong federally chartered housing programs for low-income families that are striving to buy and to have a more decent living condition. There has been a lot done. I have  as president, I would expand those opportunities even more."
Why do you believe you are fit to be the next leader of the United States of America?,"I can answer that in an awful lot of ways that take up an awful long time, but let me say that I have spent my life preparing for this assignment to be President of the United States. Im the only candidate tonight whos ever been a governor. I was a governor for 4 years in a state that is larger than the combined New England states. Its larger than South Korea. Its larger than Greece or the Philippines. Ive been president of the Senate twice. Ive lawyered for clients who could afford other lawyers. Ive learned by serving, Ive learned by studying. Ive learned by traveling. Ive learned by being your Vice President all these years, and Ive either gotten that wisdom or Im now too old to get any more. And I think at this point you look at the candidates. You look at those who have made their applications for the most powerful office on Earth, and I believe that Im best qualified."
What is your overarching vision for the country?,"I must say that Im surprised at President Reagans opening comments, particularly the allusion to Jimmy Carter. There certainly is no similarity, in my judgment, between the four years of Ronald Reagan and the four years of Jimmy Carter. Ive been asked now a number of times to issue a report card, because at the end of the presidents term, he graded himself as he did four years ago. Well, I dont need an A+ in my term in office. I believe that the American people have graded thats their privilege and their right in this upcoming election. I wont take an A+ because if Im elected vice president Im going to serve the American people; if Im not, I lose my job; if I am, Im a public servant. And I hope that the American people will not give President Reagan an A+ because we have still so many failing grades to attack in the future. Every president comes to office with a vision of America, how that vision is translated into reality. Ive watched it now for the last four years, as I saw it in the administration before, as President Reagan did with Jimmy Carter. There is a difference when there is a vision in office and a commitment to it. My vision is of an America at peace with itself, no longer divided, a house restored. I believe that Jimmy Carter had that vision of America, but he was unable to translate it into accomplishment. I believe that the opportunities that have been given to President Reagan and the Republican Party were not properly capitalized upon because they inherited a banking system and a monetary system that gave them the lowest interest rates in the history of our country. It was a time when there was a chance for peace. Many are still concerned with the American defense, but I know that President Reagan has in these last weeks contributed mightily to the well-prepared American defense. And yet, still that vision, which is essential for a president, is lacking in this administration. Secretary of State Kissinger graded the administration in which he served an A. But in the fundamental long-range goals of this administration it is failing: to contain inflation, to eliminate the federal deficit, to have a system of exports in which we achieve a trade balance, to help empower women, to help associate the improving understanding between the United States and Western Europe.  These basic long-range goals of the American people are still waiting for a commitment and a vision that will allow us to finalize and conclude these goals. The attack on the taxation system has led to a broader gap between the middle class between the poor and the wealthy. Weve watched the spiraling deficits grow; we see trade alliances disappearing because we deal with third-world countries with weak currencies and because we have seen the dollar so strong. The vision of a united nation tragically was lost with the assassination of the wonderful, great Rev. Mr. McBride. In my judgment, he and Coretta King were able to unite Americans, the nation of proper strength and human dignity at home. But that vision is gone, too. My vision is one that brings us together, a strength that helps eliminate the tension and division, pointed fingers of blame that have marked these last few years. We have still got much to do. And I pledge as I did in the other debate, the American people will be the measuring stick, you will be the arbiters of who will serve the next four years. I dont think anybody can grade themselves. That will rest with you. But we do have a vision.
"
What is your plan to manage inflation and ensure economic stability?,"Youve said this before, though.  Youve said this before. You  when you came into office the rate was 20 percent now its 24 percent. Inflation has gone up. What  what are you going to do in the second term that youve not done in this term as you said you would to control inflation?"
How will you create jobs and reduce unemployment across the nation?,"Well, as you indicated earlier, it dropped from 9 percent to 8 percent between August and September, but Ive got a feeling that it wont drop between September and October; in fact, I think it may rise. I have no prediction as to what it will be in November when the election occurs. But the most uh important thing is not the percentage, but the number of new jobs that are created. Weve only created about 2 million new jobs in the last two years. In the 1973-74 period, there were 3.7 million new jobs created. Weve got a long way to go. In the last three months, uh unemployment has risen among minorities. Theres about a million two unemployed black workers in this country, in American Indian workers, among uh white workers about a million. And overwhelmingly, about 75% of the people who are unemployed now have been out of work for more than 15 weeks. So weve got a long slow job-creating process ahead of us, and that job creation is the commitment of mine in the next four years."
What steps will you take to balance the federal budget and manage the national debt?,"If it was just the national debtube  debt managementb maybe Id pause a minute. Its to pay the bills of this government that the  this national debt is there and you got to lump them both into one big picture. And  both the bipartisan commissions on the budget didnt call for a stiff tax increase, called for an increase between $13 and $16 billion for  for both years. So I guess I wont have that pang of conscience when that  if those recommendations are passed during the lame duck session. But I can tell you this: Im not going to play a game with the American public. As soon as I get in office, Im going to have to take a look at what this damn  excuse me, uh, at this deficit is going to be. And then I can give you a projection. But at  at  at best, if the economy keeps rolling the way its  its rolling right now, theyre predicting about a $150 billion a  deficit. I certainly hope its that low. If it is, its going to be relatively easy to do it. If it stays at $200 billion, then well have to return to your question on how the heck  excuse me  (laughter) Im making a habit of this (laughter) on  on how the heck were gonna do it. But something like that would have to be done. Roger, I refuse  I just crossed my heart and hope to die. I refuse to get into that game and Im not sure that any other person could give a more honest answer."
How will you ensure that all Americans have access to quality and affordable healthcare?,"My husband, until he was Governor, was a lawyers wife, and thats how Ian and I struggled and paid for our health care. We do have the capacity in this country to give a continued medical coverage for everyone, no matter what. And Ive also worked all over this country, with community groups, and Im excited about the plans many of them are coming up with, and I think many of them will help. Certainly my new health care plan will be a great help in this because all these types of health care plans will be laid out for everyone so that they know that they have choices and what they have to pay. And I believe we can afford this and I believe we have to do it."
How will your administration address the pressing challenges of environmental sustainability?,"Mr. Ritchie, the decisions that were made and not made in this administration have made our environment better, air quality in our cities  extreme air pollution  doubled in two the last two years of President Nixons administration. Its now 80 percent cleaner. Two hundred major hazardous waste sites planned under this administration, only eight discovered in four years. The chemical release inventory system that lists all hazardous chemicals not attempted by this administration. More politically-motivated,  economic and  and  and toxic waste sites than under the previous administration, 173%. Greenhouse effects and acid rain, no studies by this administration and no necessary  international agreements accomplished. This administration has taken the energy policy of the last administration, the McCloy-ur-Ban-croft plan, and is now implementing it with a supply-related energy policy, without concern for conservation or for environmental quality. We need static mapping that will list all critical environmental areas in our country so that industry can know what they will be limited in before they plan a plant. The national health insurance task force of this administration recommended a system of health insurance that would not protect about 25% of our weaker Americans. It was recommended to the president, he endorsed it. The delegates at the Republican Convention forced the president to drop it. That was a good one. James Watt is the most far-Right  secretary of the Interior that weve ever had. He has deprived the President of Chairman of the Council on Environmental Quality. He has rolled back 50 years of environmental protection in this country over the protest of the American people. When the Lake Toxaway  uh  scandal broke, with the black ooze dripping out of the solid waste and the toxic waste area,  this administration  uh  ordered a meeting in the White House. Not to implement the $45 million program for the cleanup that 12 Democratic congressmen had urged. The meeting was to blame those dirty environmental group groups outside the White House. This is the kind of administration weve had as far as the environment is concerned. By 1990, about $800 million will be required to clean up every toxic waste site. We can do it with static mapping, we can do it with computerization. We need more  uh  quality impact statements and toxic control laws that will finally allow us, as the McCloy-ur-Ban-croft energy plan did, to locate all sites before we recognize where they are by pollution. This has not been done and its simple  simple ignorance on the part of this administration. One toxic expert has been appointed to the Environmental Protection Agency, the one who got there by the political patronage  and  and political spokesman route. This has  this very dangerous  very dangerous lack of knowledge has characterized this administration. Its time to clean that up."

What reforms would you propose to improve the education system?,"I think that the most immediate steps to be taken in education are to make certain that our educational tax credits are passed in this Congress. Thus far, there are about twenty-three members of the House whose votes we expect to change before we adjourn in September, and educational tax credits will give the low- and lower-middle-income families a chance to send their children to the parochial or private or college of their choice and will relieve the public schools of a substantial amount of their burdens. Second, on retraining computers. I remember when I was governor, in the so-called trayless cafeteria system in Georgia that my wife instituted, we had a teachers training program that was about $30 million, which I fought very hard to be able to persuade parents to get involved in their childrens education. These were parents or volunteers. They studied accounting and reading and English and so forth, $30 million, it was a very successful program. California has one now that works very well with computers. With the advent of computers and the inevitable layoff of approximately 15 to 20 percent of the work force, we have to have a good retraining program, and that also would help us. We need to devote a far greater percentage of our total national budget to education. Under the Republicans, the percentage of the national budget devoted to education has dropped 20 percent, and since Mr. Ford has been in the White House, the amount of money for education has been cut very drastically after a cut under Mr. Nixon. This is, I think, a major responsibility in government is to provide the opportunity for education. The Greenwood bill to grant or to lend long-term loans to institutionalize long-term loans to education for our colleges would also be a step. These are ways in which we can proceed to put young people to work.  Provide relief for our elementary and secondary schools with tax advantages for lower income families to have educational choice, provide for retraining of the parents so they can work in new jobs because of the impact of computers,  and also put priority in the expenditure of our public budget on education,  including passage of the Greenwood long-term loan bill for colleges."
How will you restore trust in government and ensure transparency in your administration?,"I will invite journalists in as my predecessors did  open the records. This is a good question, and I think Joyce called me on it, and I did ask the Glens Falls newspaper if they would call me back. I think they did try to call me back. They left a message on my home phone, and I didnt get it. And it was too late in the day to call back. I apologize to the Glens Falls newspaper. I normally do call back every newspaper that asks me, but I do point you  I will point you to the comprehensive legislation in the Congress. Every year we submit an enormous amount of information to the Congress, and every year they come up with bills in the direction of sunshine, and almost every year, or every other year, they at least put it into their conference committee for a small period of time. So we are trying to respond. I hope there will be additional sunshine legislation passed."
What policies will you pursue to ensure equality and protect the rights of all Americans?,"I would have to say that the most difficult assignment in politics today is to address yourself to the civil rights needs of the people in our country. The courts and the Congress and all the executive officers of our Nation under no administration have been more vocally and consistently committed to the equal treatment of our people. Unfortunately, the total integration of our society, particularly in the fields of housing and the community life, has not yet been accomplished. We are a pluralistic society. The enforcement of hunting down and putting to punishment people who violate the civil rights of others  in other words, the Klan, or those who have recently let loose some acid in the face of a syphilis patient, or those who would violate the civil rights of a black or a woman  all thats pursued vigorously by us. The appointment of blacks and other minorities and women in high supervisory positions in the Department of Justice is pursued. We have three black and two Spanish- American, uh, U.S. attorneys in the federal district courts, more than all the previous administrations, all the previous hundred years since the inception of the department, combined. The  uh, the, uh, people who are practicing law in the Voting Rights Section, who are there to sue where we find any violations against blacks and votes in southern and western states, uh, are three-quarters black, uh, uh, or, or Spanish-American. So we want very much, and Im committed to the civil rights of all of our people, and all those who are politically connected with us are equally committed. Womens rights, uh, the  press release that I gave when I was first elected-majority leader cited the civil rights of women, blacks, and Hispanics, uh as my objective for that Congress. I equally am committed to the civil rights of women. Uh, unemployment among black men our national average is about 10 percent: among black men its about 18  among black women its about 13. I recently told a civil rights group, in answer to one of their questionnaires, that, that we would be very strong proponents for affirmative action in the hiring policies of American business, and that is a very serious shortcoming of this administration. In the field of estates, unemployment compensation, welfare  equal, uh, uh, hurts women and children much more than it does men, and were very committed to, to improved welfare housing assistance, and stopping the cut of public housing in this coming year. Uh, this administration has seriously been mistaken in its cuts in education, training, housing assistance, and equal employment opportunity. Those, those areas are-are very serious for us. Weve also fallen down on compliance in the, in the Equal Employment Opportunity areas, so that we dont have equitable, uh, uh, treatment of blacks and women, and other minorities today, so were gonna follow the policy that the Congress, uh, led by  by us on the Democratic side, has, has insisted upon, and that is a, a, uh  very diligent, uh, practice of the civil rights and women and minority rights about the Bill of Rights, where we will strengthen the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. These-three elements of the Bill of, of Rights have not been funded by this administration to the uh  degree that they were by President Ford previous administration. And now with Byron White  Justice White  Mr. Reagan is threatening to appoint to replace Justice Blackmun, who has joined the-three judges, uh, uh, so that those- there are three minorities and three  uh-majorities on the-re-presentage of the totality of the issues beteiligt, and the-four of the-eight justices that make the ultimate decision, Mr. Reagan would appoint a, a uh  man whom I assume would be able and qualified for purposes of administrative experience to the-replace, uh, Mr. Blackmun. And to me that would be a major step backwards and a threat to the women-demands on the Equal E-employment Opportunity Commission, equal-rights amendment, major case, uh, uh, by uh, uh, the  uh  groups for the-youve got about four hundred such, uh, groups that have been uh forced to get together to file amicus or  third-party briefing for, for their members. And if, and if  at uh, this, uh, gentlemen on  on those uh, uh, areas would be major uh  trouble codecs, and that would be in the field of civil rights, particularly, which have demanded-including women, including equal rights."
How will you lead the country through challenges and unite Americans with differing perspectives?,"Well, thats why Im here tonight. Thats the purpose of these debates. I have not only been trained on the issues, I have been in the cockpit with my President, Jimmy Carter, trying to make the decisions that affect this country. I not only handle domestic questions, I handle trade; I handle questions that go to final procedures. I not only know the intricate detail, I understand the moral and the ethical implications that you face in leadership every single day. Leadership means also bringing people who have different views together in common effort. With President Carter, I have seen that done, and I know how to do it. And thats the leadership that this country has not had. I think there is a longing in the American people to have a unified government, to have a government that reflects decency, honesty and integrity. And I think they want an administration that understands whats happening in the world and in this country."
"What is your plan to manage immigration in a way that balances national security, economic needs, and humanitarian responsibilities?","For three weeks now I have been standing here saying I would like to see an opportunity as to what we do about Central America. I think we could likely- as to look at these refugees pouring into our nation from El Salvador, I think we could solve that by solving what is going on in El Salvador, not by pretending that these people dont need our help. They do. The ref- the overrun problem with the live at the border is a problem. Its caused, of course, by the influx of this traffic, as sometimes they try to get in. We catch 2 million of them trying to get in. Were doing something about it.  But I would like to see- we are building the wall. And the reason were building the wall, because thats where our- at our borders, particularly at Meri- at Mer- at Mexico, 33 of our national security problems are found. And by that, by fixing that wall, it prevents against that- those infiltrations."
How will you ensure equal opportunities for marginalized communities in our country?,"Id like to answer your question regarding the future of our cities and what we would do about it when the next President takes office. The first thing I would do in our city programs would be uh  institute what used to be called the uh  Model Cities programs. These earlier programs, until they were termed uh  pork barrel, used to direct substantial amounts of money into the poor areas of our cities, the minority areas, into the uh  environment, the housing, the uh  educational opposition, parks, uh things of that sort. They were very useful and effective. I think that was one of the purposes served under the Brown v. Uh  Board of Education, to see that minorities, uh uh  poor communities got adequate attention in a uh  different, superior way. And I think that commitment ought to be employed, too. Right now we have a uh  revival of racism in our country and I think, uh attempted segregation as you see in south Florida with the 8-1 CRA. Uh  Im sure Jimmy Carter will correct that. We have uh  phenomenally getting rid of  of  of Blacks who have been moving into housing projects in so far as  as white housing projects in so far as they have been integrated through a court order. And I think this is not right and if Im  if Im uh  fortunate enough to be elected and in a position to do something about it, you will probably see in  in the area of our cities more forte given under a  new Civil Rights Department with uh a brief given under the uh  the Justice Department in defense of the  the uh civil rights programs of quite a few uh  cities who are getting very rough in their uh  insistence that minority groups be excluded from the uh  siting of uh  environmentally damaging structures now. But my  my major purpose to get uh multi-family housing into single family neighborhoods with adequate parks and playgrounds."
Why do you believe you are fit to be the next leader of the United States of America?,"It helps to be 72 years old. Ive had three careers and Ive been successful at all three of them. I was an attorney. I got off to a terrific start, and 20 years later I was considered by many to be the best trial lawyer in the United States. I made a lot of money, but I left it because of a loneliness in the profession and a sense that I must be involved in something more zip, something broader. And thats when I entered politics. I was elected to the legislature, the state senate in California, and I was the leader. Just two years later, Governor Reagan appointed me to the state Supreme Court. I was the first appointee in three generations to be re- appointed; that alternates between Republicans and Democrats. That tells me I did a good job. I left the court after eight years, to run for governor, having served 32 years in public office. I had to leave for two reasons: One, because I was getting bored, and two, my daughters said I was boring. And if your daughters say youre boring, youve gotta change. This is my third try  and the charm. But Im running for president for the same reason I ran for governor: Because I believe in the promise of America, and I believe that these past eight years, weve come a long way and weve done good things. But there are some very, very real dangers in the life of our country. Now is not the time for a zealous new car owner to buy a lemon."
What is your overarching vision for the country?,"I said I think thats one of the most difficult questions Ive ever been asked. I dont think you can handle a question like that in thirty seconds. I made a choice of not saying what I had to say here, but saying what I had to say for the American people. And if theyll allow it, Ill say it."
What is your plan to manage inflation and ensure economic stability?,"I think that the greatest threat to our economic growth and prosperity is continued inflation. And I believe that the Inflation Reduction Act, which will go into effect tomorrow, will be the best single approach that Ive ever seen proposed by any president, to bring inflation down. Mr. Ford, in his Security Council Statement, says that he hopes that inflation will be reduced to 2 percent a year. Weve never had that before. Even during the Great Depression, it was about 3 percent a year. The best that Ive seen done in the last 40 or more years, with a Republican president in the White House, was about 4 percent a year. Other presidents, before, who had Democratic Congresses working with them, have done far better. But our approach is very simple. We do not transfer the blessings of inflation from one group to another, treating one group on an election year as though they were poor and deserving. Under the inflation Adjustment Act, everybody got their colas, even executives got 17 percent bonuses and thats why we had continued high inflation. We simply, as we go along, work on the five or six major basic commodities, like oil and natural gas and processed food and steel, and as we do this, and as the economy grows more productive, we will bring inflation down to an acceptable level, 4 percent a year or less, which is a foreign experience. Inflation under the Democrats has averaged about one full point lower than under Republican presidents. Thats the way to do it. And we let the consumer pick the winners and losers."
How will you create jobs and reduce unemployment across the nation?,"This is a real diffrerence between Governor Reagan and myself. I think he would do well to try to win Texas with his answer, because I think the people of Texas are too smart to believe that  uh  tax advantages for corporations across the nation are gonna create jobs in Texas. Those jobs are going overseas. Why would Texas create those jobs by giving corporations who leave the country, uh  tax advantages? It is absolutely insane. Uh  what does have to be done, and Mr. Hassert is right. I have said that my economic program would reduce unemployment to 4 percent or lower in five years. It has to be done by incentivizing the creation of new jobs by small businesses and by new businesses. It has to be done by public service jobs  a record weve already proved in American can be achieved, and by retraining and education of those who are thrown out of work because of international competition. Weve gotta boost exports. Weve got to use the tax system with tax credits and, and  and targeting for investments, in the very areas where we want jobs. Weve gotta have an energy program, a regional economic policy in the defense areas of the country. Weve gotta have the housing market opened again. And weve gotta have, also, the  much stronger on protection of the American consumer against the big monopolies and cartels of our nation and internationally. All of these things had to go together, if we are to achieve the very ambitious goal of 4 percent unemployment. But the American people, American business people and the American worker will achieve it."
What steps will you take to balance the federal budget and manage the national debt?,"I thought there might be a question about balancing the budget. I believe that we have to get control on our deficit and our national debt. The object is not to have a balanced budget, because that would mean a Depression in our economy. The object is, at each point in time, to bring our expenditures in line with our revenues as a basis for making this economy grow. Ive indicated that were going to cut defense spending, 7 percent. Every Commission, both the President and the Joint Chiefs of Staff Commission told us that we could do this without sacrifice of security. Thats 70 billion dollars over the next 7 years. Im going to take the 56 billion dollars that the Presidents wasting on an unneeded and a costly tax program and put that against the deficit. I also believe that we have to look at additional revenues. I will not, under any conditions, jeopardize our economic recovery by a massive tax increase, but I do know, as some of the Democratic orthodox  think  that this can all be done by cutting defense alone. And I dont want to get into rubbery projections of economic growth, because every time this President announces he has a balanced budget, over the next couple of months he adds to the deficit another 10 or 15 billion dollars. And theres just no trust anymore. Every economic return has to be verified. But I do believe that we can achieve about 4 percent of gross national product growth, and I believe thats what were beginning to do. So it takes a combination of expenditures, reduced expenditures and increased revenues over the process of time. If we dont do this, were now up to 1.3 trillion dollars in national debt. This year well pay over 200 billion dollars just in interest on that national debt, which is equal to nearly over 50 percent of the defense budget. Weve got to get that down. This evermountainng national debt is a warning to the future and weve got to prevent that for the next generation."
How will you ensure that all Americans have access to quality and affordable healthcare?,"I remember, thirty-three years ago, when I ran for the Senate. I took this very issue, the issue of health care and health insurance, in front of a town meeting in Brockton, Massachusetts. I listened to good working-class Americans, tenants of public housing who held their breath in order to draw a small old-age pension, and their savings were in the health insurance that they had. They stood up and said, This is what we want on the floor of the Senate. And I fought for it and I voted for it. I remember the passage of Medicare  so does every American; thats the program that helped preserve the dignity of old age and [delivered] people from poverty in the shadow of retirement. That was resisted in its time. And Newt Gingrich has spoken scornfully of it. And now theyre trying to scrap it. I remember when they passed COBRA, and we pushed for it. It said if hed been working for three years and he lost his job, they couldnt take away his health insurance because it went with the job; he still could keep it. I pushed for that. We got it. I remember something, too. I remember just a week or so ago, I debated  Governor Bush and I said to myself, I wonder  hes a nice man and hes smart; I wonder if he knows all this. You see, the American people know this. In poll after poll, when you ask them just a simple question: Do you and your family want President Clinton to be able to work out a plan to provide adequate health care that you can afford? By 70 percent, they all respond yes, even Republicans. And do you notice how the Republicans seek to twist it? Bob Dole, the other night on television, actually said, All this, these initiatives for health insurance  or his health care plan  hes all for it, but he just doesnt want to pay for it. I mean, is it possible not to be for health care and pay for it? What kind of thinking is this? Are we going to face these costs? You bet we are. And finally, the American people are going to demand that the people they work for in Washington come to grips with one of the great  vital issues of our  of their generation. And we will. And it will keep costs down and we will delay spending. And, yes, we will find a way. Just like Bill Clinton and Al Gore have guaranteed to provide this insurance for every American family that needs it, were going to get some savings by holding down the out-of-pocket costs. And as sure as I stand here and draw breath, we are going to get it done, and there is no stopping us. You can call up Harry and Louise and try, but were going to get it done. And you folks watching at home, you remember what they said. I know they wont be able to stop it."
How will your administration address the pressing challenges of environmental sustainability?,Will there be effective enforcement of existing regulations? Who will pay for new regulations?
What are your top priorities in regards to foreign policy?How will you strengthen America's national defense and handle relations with adversarial nations?,"Assuming that were able to establish the political principle  I call it that, as opposed to linkage  to go to the Israeli-Syrian dis  Rabin-Sadat peace agreement, to strengthen Israels frontiers to maintain Israels security."
What reforms would you propose to improve the education system?,"Both of our sons went to public schools, and one of them now is in a private university  it is a church-related institution. Im an educator myself. I love education. I value it very much, and Ive devoted a good bit of my life to it. What we need in education today are a series of  of major reforms and changes. We need to make sure that every young child who comes to school meets a readiness requirement so that the money that goes into education has a good shot of working. We need to have a major effort by our educational institutions at the secondary school level to teach remedial education for those that need it. We need to have at the secondary school level, a chance for every student to learn a foreign language, to use relatively the same textbooks so the teachers can communicate among themselves, give a lot of parental help and supervision with management committees in the schools, and have an expert, supposedly, in each classroom so that the teaching process is not so authoritarian, but more like a peer discussion. We need to involve, at the elementary, high school, and university level, the students in work outside their community as a requirement for graduation. Lets use our universities, as I advocated in opening up China instead of loading our ships and airplanes with defense materials, lets load them with educational materials. The new presidency, which I proposed and he endorsed in both the party platforms, have adopted a  an advocacy of educational reforms. Lets have the educator presidents, secretaries of education so that we can tackle, for a long time  I was on the education and labor committee  the problems of college costs and burdens on students and student loans and work with our colleges in a continuing process to get the costs down and quality up. Let our research, as we have in a lot of other countries, go to where the most brilliant students are, rather than giving automatically grants and research money to the most politically powerful institutions. I sat on the pure research committee in Congress, and we're in the process of breaking up the chancellorships in our university systems to be more like the British and the Germans, where it's  its easier for private interest to get to these very brilliant and largely self-supporting universities, because with the research money with good tax credits, and with involvement by industry, we can solve a lot of the unemployment. There's a good computer  computer  computer literacy opportunity that we can expand. With the work-fellowship programs, we can let students earn their way through college. Let's have indexed loans for parents so that parents borrowing dont have to pay usury rates just because their children have a little bit of income. We've got enough  I think I'm the only candidate with a public school and a public college background; my opponent has one or two years in a private school as a teacher, and no knowledge of public financing of colleges. We've got a real chance now to make a breakthrough  a new presidency in Washington and a chance for reforms in education that will pursue this equal chance in life that we've been denying to the poor groups in our country, especially minorities, for the last 20 years."
How will you restore trust in government and ensure transparency in your administration?,"This years Montgomery bus boycott is an excellent example of what Im talking about in terms of trust  letting people know whats going on. Exactly the same thing was in 1944, 1938, or eight months ago. The federal governments position was that these buses were not interstate buses. Simple information, correcting that, would have opened these buses. Thats just an example of it. There was no bad faith, no evasiveness, just lack of trust and confidence by the executive branch of our government. And at the eend of the year, were going to have a commission on the presidency, or a group outside of government, not the present commission that President Ford appointed. Before that end of the term we will open the White House, we will open all the records of the executive branch over a three-month period. We will answer, if possible, a thousand questions that the people wanna answer. And perhaps they can recommend changes, also, that will increase the confidence of our people in the presidency. I think its very important that that be done. But two things efitt the future  a strong and vigorous press, and the Congress of the United States taking its oversight responsibility authorize  seriously in a nonpartisan way.
"
What policies will you pursue to ensure equality and protect the rights of all Americans?,"Well, we were making some race progress until the election of Ronald Reagan, where he stopped the civil rights program that President Carter was pursuing and equal opportunities for employment, promotion, education and housing. I would, of course, insist upon strict enforcement of the civil rights and the voting rights legislation. However, the best way to ensure equality of opportunity for all Americans is to pursue a program in education that guarantees a decent education for all. Under President Carters administration we had a program, which has been continued under my administration  let me be truthful and not give the impression that something was done before I got in. When I got in, thats when the handicapped childrens education program was accelerated, and also the food stamp, the school lunch and the Title 1 programs that help poor children  all those were initiated or carried out in a stronger approach by Jimmy Carter. Thats what we are doing. We also insist on the strong enforcement of equal pay for equal work. In welfare reform, we did insist and insist now on a proper use of the welfare benefits. The AFDC is, it gives the grant to the family, and we insist that it go to the woman who is head of household. This has been misrepresented, and it falls right on those who are supposed to be the beneficiaries. It doesnt go to the women and children often. So if we can keep on with this equal opportunity, make sure that we have a fair and decent and quality education in the office and also adequate health care services very often to youngsters who now just dont receive any because of poverty  all those things will make it a lot easier to make sure that all Americans can live happily and healthy in this country and also receive a portion of our countries growing wealth that I expect to be available in the future."
How will you lead the country through challenges and unite Americans with differing perspectives?,"Well, I think Im a pretty tough negotiator myself. As a matter of fact, I think Im the best at negotiating Ive ever met in my life. And thats one of the reasons Im being graded so well by the American people on the job Im doing. I see the public involved and I deal with the opposition and give them credits for accomplishment and also to see that the American citizens see that theyre being responsible, too. One of the basic conflicts that we have is not a conflict to bring the American peoples frustrations and disappointments and so forth, but looking forward, the desire of the American people, quite common, not right or left, but in common, that we offer a new direction for the future. And Im not talking about right or left there. After economic recovery program we can avoid this budget problem, which bedevils us since 1971. We have a basic economic philosophy that sees, if we got between $85 and $90 billion surplus, a rising GNP, which I think were on the verge of, to put that money in the pockets of the American people, as we did last year with the $15.7 billion tax cut, to provide jobs for people now unemployed. I quite common with the American people want to end this fratricidal strife in unemployment, so we all march together, for instance. All Americans, 90 or 92 percent of us want to maintain the Welfare State. We dont want to go back on my watch or any other American watch, to 1910, before the progressives introduced some elements in government that yielded us a better society. I see also a coalition that wants to make the tax system more fair, as I tried to do in 1979, that yielded us the bipartisan tax legislation, and some progress there. We have a Bill of Rights-called a Middle Class Bill of Rights, which is a tax exemption for dependents, a home mortgage interest deduction, a property tax deduction, also tax credits for the poor working people, also the elderly who have those terrible windfalls because of inflation. Now this is a quite common goal. We can have a progressive advancement in this very essential area of taxation and still have no problem in the total revenue yield by the Federal Treasury, so we have no deficit produced by it. That way the American people join together. I have happily this year, after Republicans took over the Senate after the elections, I have the highest rating Ive ever had with the American public, about 65 percent for the first six months of this year. And polling has indicated, in a very revealing way, that as we approach the elections, those principal premises that I just enunciated, on which I stand, Im committed to, and I strongly believe, are embracing the American people in increasing proportions regardless of partisan differences  theyre even bringing Republicans to me. This is what I meant when I said just a few moments ago that I believe that a Republican Congress could be a shoe-in for me, because theyll accomplish certain things with me. But if the status quo continues and the antagonism and the looming fears over the heads of the American people  that would negate it. And I see an increase in our political power in that case. But it wouldnt be the accomplishment of the opposition. It would be my accomplishment and the American peoples accomplishment."
"What is your plan to manage immigration in a way that balances national security, economic needs, and humanitarian responsibilities?","Theres no question that immigration policy is something Ive been working on for over seven years as Governor of California. It is the single most important responsibility of the federal government that has been ignored recently by President Reagan. In the last eight years, he has failed to introduce, support and win  passagen an immigration law that was effective, fair, and that fulfilled our responsibility. What I plan to do is very simple.  Ive lived along the border of Mexico. I have seen the problems firsthand. I have a very simple four-part proposal. First of all, we have to protect that border over a better immigration control. Ive been years in support of a better border patrol, better search and surveillance. We know where  along the border  where are the crossing areas that are illegal, we can use those computers to pull people out of the lines more easily. And when somebody comes before us who does not have the papers or the legal and legitimate citizenship claim, we send them home.  thats the first part. The second part is we have to enforce the laws that are on the books that protect security so were not bringing in people who are criminals, who are likely to cause us trouble.  and there I have supported the city of Los Angeles in their efforts to prevent Los Angeles from being the dumping ground of criminal aliens by the federal government. The third part is we fulfill the responsibility that those who are already in our country who are working, including many illegal aliens, dont force the legal, legitimate people who need jobs out of employment.  that means that we have to have a mandatory identification identification card system so that when the employer is brought in, if at random, and checked, if that employer is found to have hired somebody who falsely pretended to be someone else or was illegal, that employer is the one who is responsible, and its criminally prosecuted. Fourth, and most importantly, we have to have a very humane immigration policy. It has to fulfill the asylum and refugee responsibilities that we have as a nation. Together with that, its very important that we immediately introduce a program that gives the people who are here, who have been here for a long time, who is being productive, who is contributing to our society, who are not criminals, who are not likely to do us any harm, who are still in a non-punitive way, who are still in a loyal way, allows them to work toward legal residency. That program must be coupled with stiff penalties on employers who hire newly arrived illegal aliens  because what doesnt work, what does not work is the round-up. The round-up does not work, we cant police our country that way, it is against our Constitution, and it would be laboriously expensive."
How will you ensure equal opportunities for marginalized communities in our country?,"I think Ive answered this question a moment ago. There will be no quotas in Affirmative Action, there will be no set-asides. I dont support that force in America to guarantee equal opportunity. I support the right to vote and the doing away with literacy tests. I support the opening up of the job marketplace and have done it and will continue to do it. Theres a long way to go before we reach the promised land of equality. But forcing people with quotas or with set-asides to hire people simply because of race or sex is something that would not integrate America, it would segregate America further. There are sensitivities that have to be met. I believe the overwhelming majority of white Americans understand the problems of the African-Americans, Latinos, and Native Americans. They want to help. They dont want to be mandated to do it. And with the coordination by the federal government, a non-coercive approach with the good will of the people thats what Ive seen in 1976 as Governor,  dont help people go up the ladder."
Why do you believe you are fit to be the next leader of the United States of America?,"I think any president has to be  women, African-Americans and Hispanics. No president knows all the answers or knows all the questions. What you have to do is have Unix balance your administration.  But most important, you put the peoples questions with the knowledge they have behind them down on the table. You hold up your finger and you do the arithmetic. Whos got the most lines? Those are the answers you give to the American people in the American peoples welfare.  And thats what Ill do as president of the United States. That will be my road map. And in doing, I wont just say heres ten questions. Watch me. Well thats tomorrow. Its not the presidency of the United States. Ill tell you what Ill do. I wont just put them in my cabinet. Ill commission a nationwide committee that will file reports with me as president of the United States. That is, not just in the first year, but throughout the first term, as people file reports with me ill make the report, as I did as governor. Thats Governor Briscoe of Texas while Im Governor Brown as the American Country In 200 thats real freedom. Thats participatory freedom. Thats the real way that we citizens, able to look at our fellow most cherished, the presidency. President of all the American people. If Im elected president, same secretary you have now in the White House. Same purchasing agent. Same chauffeur. Same stewardesses. Same cooks. Well have more packages surveillanced in government. With your consent, of course. Each you and the American people will choice on me every two, instead of every four years. And those ten questions behind closet doors, youll know if Im doing something Im not supposed to do. Only the American people, continue with the same command and control you had with Gerald Ford. Thank you very much."
What is your overarching vision for the country?,That Im going to be married to Mr. Right.
What is your plan to manage inflation and ensure economic stability?,"First, we need to balance the budget. Weve got to bring these deficits down. The two biggest years of deficits in American history have just occurred under President Reagan, and now we see the continuation of this program, budget-wise. Those deficits cause inflation, they give us high interest rates, which slows the economy. Secondly, weve got to sensibly control the way in which Federal spending goes. It shouldnt be across-the-board cuts: education, national defense, highways, the whole thing let it be spent. There ought to be some priorities. But we do need to balance the budget. A third way in which we control inflation and get it down to a manageable rate is to see that the cost of doing business is kept under good control. This means that we need an efficient economic system. I believe that might be the major overriding single commitment a responsible president can contribute on his own. But inflation will continue to eat away at the buying power of American families. And its not going to be over with in just a few months. And a sound, steady program related to deficits, responsible priorities and presidential leadership can make a big difference."
How will you create jobs and reduce unemployment across the nation?,"First of all, controlling inflation is essential to the creation of new jobs. Up to this very moment, weve got about fourteen million people with jobs in America, whos one-third of our workforce, who  who are unemployed. It might be a little bit better if we included houseswives who are working part time to help make the family budget balance, or if we included the  the school kids who have graduated from high school who cant find a job or college graduates, but nonetheless, its a tremendous number of people looking for work. Among these seventeen million people is a relatively small number of people who would just go back to regular productive jobs. If we can rigorously pursue a control on inflation, cut it down dramatically, like we did last year, that in itself will create new jobs. Secondly, exports to foreign countries, as we sell more goods, that creates new jobs. We have got a trade deficit. Right now, if we had a balanced budget, a balanced trade, we would have another two to two and a half million jobs. I am going to pursue a policy of a fast track on energy conservation, pursued rapidly across the country. Every house or every building or every school house thats restored is like the creation of a new job. Up to date, between our solar and wind power and other areas, weve got about fifty-five thousand new jobs, just between the two of us. The battle for coal, which would reduce the need for imported oil, is another example of where we can create new jobs. The shipbuilding and also the railroads have an opportunity to make money  and  and modernize and have a profit by use of these lower-sulfur, high-energy, uh  coals. Also, the civil rights bill, which  which the President has opposed, would be another major means. Also, uh  the industrial tax rebate which I have called for also would be a very effective way of creating new jobs. In the steel industry today, if the steel companies would take a look at productivity and spend some of the profit that theyve made in recent months on  on new machinery, they could increase their profit and maybe employ forty thousand more steelworkers  who happen to be among the most unemployed in our country  and also not overflow the steel market by competing with foreign competitors. So there is a reasonable way to do it without spending a lot of government money or aggravating the already growing national debt. And finally, weve got to is strengthen our education programs, along with health care and welfare reform."
What steps will you take to balance the federal budget and manage the national debt?,"If something had to be done, if Im debating what to ask the people to do, what would have done: Would have raised Social Security benefits 3% or raised, uh, Social Security taxes. I opted for a short-range solution and something Im not proud of. The Congress did the same thing. We both made a mistake. We both erred. But if it had to be done, I would have opted for the 3% raise for  the benefit to the people rather than a tax increase. But as it turned out, the  the uh steps we used, theyre not repeated. With new techniques were going to be able to show that a balanced budget can be achieved without raising taxes, and without cutting the national defense. With new techniques we can go in and attack the waste and the fraud and the duplication and the mismanagement in the millions of budget accounts of the  of the federal government. Its been almost 200 years since a president has had to fix priorities in the budget. Harry Truman was the last. Since then the Congress has adjusted and amended and added to and spread out over a couple of years education programs, health programs, community health programs, a retirement program, a disability program. With those new techniques that have been tried successfully  successfully in state governments around the country, were going to put the federal government on the same path as the balanced family budget. This is a commitment to the American people: by the end of my term, in four years, the budget will be balanced or Ill die trying."
How will you ensure that all Americans have access to quality and affordable healthcare?,"Whats wrong with our health care system is not reflected in the fact that we spend over $1 trillion on health care. Whats wrong is that we spend it in the wrong way. Weve never defined as a nation a right to basic health care. We have dramatic differences in the quality of care available to the American people, with the poorer people and minorities and people in rural areas, getting a much lesser quality of care than those of us who are privileged. We have no cost-effectiveness. We provide the worlds most exotic medicine for the few and leave to the rest of the people the most primitive kind of health care. As a result, we spend two or three times as much on diagnosis and treatment as we do on prevention. In terms of primary care, were at the bottom of the heap: the industrialized nations. So my major commitment is to have a right to health care defined. To this point, the American people have been paying for it all, because they pay our exorbitant, high-cost malpractice premiums. They seldom sue because they love their doctors or their hospitals. But the rest of us are paying for that. So I believe we ought to define basic health care as a right. We ought to have a single payment mechanism so we can keep records on costs. I would keep the current basic health delivery systems intact. I dont want to destroy the private practice of medicine. I dont want to destroy the care function of our hospitals. I just want to do it cheaper. I want to pay for it in a simpler, more cost-effective way. And when we have that defined, I believe it will be more affordable to all the American people. What Jimmy Carter inherited was a mess. Because President Ford vetoed cost controls for a year and a half, the cost of health care went up the first year over 23 percent, the second year over 22 percent and it finally came out in the wash that the health care companies and hospitals were making a profit in the third year, because they had so short in the first and second. And they have made control of health care a dirty word. Of course Washington is wasteful. Everybody knows that. The two congressional committees that have proposed comprehensive health legislation have each cut over 150 billion dollars out of their proposals. We have to have that kind of discipline. And we have to have the American people who know about health care involved in this control, not the insurance companies, not the health delivery systems, not the politicians in Washington. What we need is control by those who already know the cost-effectiveness, and that is the patients themselves. When we do that well for the first time in our history, we can bring about a dramatic improvement in the cost of basic health care."
How will your administration address the pressing challenges of environmental sustainability?,"I have a question for Governor Moon. Uh Mr Moon, let me try to form my uh question as I wish, and if it doesnt uh come together Ill ask your consent to do it. Mr. Moon, uh Governor Moon has said that committing this nation to its energy independence would destroy our economy; it would involve an escalation into a war economy. And yet, just six years ago we made a serious commitment with the first peace agreement with Israel, to the delivery of  He examined alternative energy sources. With this present oil embargo, I believe we could  hes exploring hemp and that sort of thing. I wonder if you would uh comment on that."
What are your top priorities in regards to foreign policy?How will you strengthen America's national defense and handle relations with adversarial nations?,Bonnecepteur.
What reforms would you propose to improve the education system?,"Lets deal with the question of the Federal commitment. Theres about 2 million kids in the private sector schools in America today. It costs about 12 thousand dollars  a little less than 12 thousand dollars  to adequately educate one child in the public sector schools. It costs about the same thing in the private sector schools. The total amount of money, if you took that $2700, if you took all kids out of public schools and gave that $2700 as a tax credit or tax deduction to private school kids, it would cost the average family, average taxpayer in America about $400 a year. Now, Karen and I, as you know, very wealthy like the rest of you, we might save $800 year, which we could use. Maybe well take a cruise or do something special. But 80 percent of American families, who cant afford to send their kids to private schools, they will pay nothing. So as these families who are wealthy like the Reagans and the Cains, the well-off families, as they pull their kids out of public schools and put them into the private schools, cause theyre gonna get these tax credits to subsidize them, the kids that are left in the public schools, the school budgets are gonna go down. And I get very emotional when I speak about this. You know, Dads an educator. My brother is a teacher at the university down in Virginia, my wife  my wife teaches kindergarten. And the last thing this country ought to do is to take away our public school commitment. What they ought to do is to reverse the trend of the last four years and to put adequate money into our disadvantaged kids  uh-  into the neighborhoods, into the schools with the very poor and the disadvantaged. I think that we  stick with the commitment we made in 1954 when Brown was decided by the Supreme Court, that these minority kids have a right in this country with no harassment, uh- from anybody, including the President, to go to school with their neighbors in the neighborhood. As long as that neighborhood school is maintained as long as those kids are- are at home, as long let these ethics be religious, whatever they might be, but let em work  let em work in their neighborhood schools. That ought to be the primary goal. What we ought to do is put real money back into education like it was under the first two years of the  under the Johnson administration."
How will you restore trust in government and ensure transparency in your administration?,"There are two essential things that have to be done in this administration to restore the confidence of the American people in their government. The first is tomake sure the government is honest. There are so many Americans today who dont believe that our government is serving them, who dont believe that our high officials are telling them the truth. I want the American people to know that Im an honest man and that Im going to see to it that the government is honest. Transparency is necessary in a government. Ive already told you about the Revenue Sharing Act thats going to let the governors and mayors and city councils and all the rest of us work together to have a common climate of trust among us. The second thing is that Ive got to be open and accessible. Im a plain, ordinary American as you probably have already deduced from the way I speak and everything. The President ought to be accessible. I think that the press ought to be able to have daily access to the White House. I think there ought to be a weekly press conference. No prior approval of any remarks by the press ought to be given, and thats formal chatter. I think that the Presidents schedule ought to be open to public view. I have no plans for national security conferences during the course of the presidential campaign and after Im elected. While Im still a candidate and not the president, we dont have that fallacious excuse."
What policies will you pursue to ensure equality and protect the rights of all Americans?,"No, I uh, had forgotten he had a two-minute response.  That brings up uh, obviously the uh, housekeeping uh, rules that uh, each candidate has two minutes for a rebuttal, but each candidate can speak as long as he wants to uh, answer the question.  I just wanted to uh, remind my fellow uh, interlocutor here, if I could, that 270 is the number necessary to win by the uh, Electoral College.  The reference to 267 does not assume that an election is held in the uh, House of uh, Representatives which is what uh, happened in 1800.  The next president was Jefferson because the uh, House chose  him.  What is the conclusion, with 270 necessary, does the 263, 267 to 269 conclusion, leave you with a possibility of 269 each?"
How will you lead the country through challenges and unite Americans with differing perspectives?,"I would meet with every chairman of every congressional committee immediately after the election and set up a bimonthly [sic] meeting with them so I could feel their pulse and what was going on. Im not an orator Im a doer. And I believe that I can set goals and fill those goals and challenge this country to unite. Thats what Im all about. And I believe that our people feel the great need as I do. Not for me to preach at them or him to preach at them. But to go back to where we used to be as a people. We used to be a united country. We used to be a behind-the-scenes quiet super power, an economic giant that people listened to. And now were not effective because we dont agree. "
"What is your plan to manage immigration in a way that balances national security, economic needs, and humanitarian responsibilities?","The first thing that you have to do is to control the border. And until you control that border area, you will never be able to deal with the 7 million illegals who are here.  First thing we need is leadership and persuasion. Weve got to persuade the nations people that what were gonna do is in their interest. We have a fairly severe problem in regard to the holding of asylum. The difference between an illegal immigrant and an asylum holder is that they show up at the same place  exact same place, cross the same border and ask for the same thing  only one of them tells the truth. Its about a 50 percent truth factor. What we have to do is to hold those people more closely, we have to expedite their claims, and those who are not actually legitimate refugees, we have to send home, as in the  stretching of family reunification. In addition to that we have to control our employee base. I know as presidents of the United States we cant do that, we cant crack down on employers, and I dont think that we have the will to do that. Weve looked at computer verification systems. All of those things will work but they will work only if, for the first time, weve got leadership from the president down stumping the country and focusing on the problem. Particularly, every lieutenant governor, every governor  almost every mayor in the United States knows how to help us with the problem. So, first of all, give us the will to act, control the border, properly manage the asylum situation, and proceed with the computer verification. Then, set up an amnesty program  I think its unreasonable to think that the people who are here illegally could never in any chance of history get their citizenship. Weve got to address the people who are here, but the only way you can deal with the ones that might come in the very near future is if you first mastered the problem. Thats what `President Reagans amnesty have failed to do. He thought by presuming the problem was managed  remembering now that amnesty, his amnesty plan has not yet come before Congress, but because he presumes that Congress, that the American people want amnesty, he set up a system that relied on the honor system. There are people waiting now on the honor system to report their illegal problem, and theyre waiting quietly in their homes  not sending their applications in. Its a spear with no point at the top and thats what is characterized this administration. Weve got to get tough, this is a country of immigrants, we want immigrants here, but we want them here legally, weve got to get our hands on the problem and well need leadership to do it."
How will you ensure equal opportunities for marginalized communities in our country?,"The efforts that this government has already made for the minority groups and the handicapped will go on; but in addition, there will not be any excuse anymore for a government contract, with about $220 billion worth, not to be given to minority groups. Well have a small business compliance program which insists that all federal contractors abide by requirements that they have definitions and statistics on the opportunity of black firms, of Hispanic firms, of American Indian firms, of handicapped firms, to get their share of government contracts. In addition to that, we will insist in the minority business affirmative action program, to which the President referred, that there be strict compliance. That will be one of the most important goals of my presidency And over a decade, when I was Governor of Georgia, we achieved a threefold increase in those minorities owning their own businesses as a result of strict compliance requirements. We dont have to discriminate against anyone. We can give a hand up instead of a handout, and thats what we intend to do."
