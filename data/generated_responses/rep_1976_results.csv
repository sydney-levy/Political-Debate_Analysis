Question,Model_Response
Why do you believe you are fit to be the next leader of the United States of America?,"Yes.  I believe I am fit for the job because Ive spent a lifetime preparing for it. I think at this moment in time, in a world full of turbulence, we have got to have a strong America with a strong American President, where the leader of the free world can meet the challenges to preserve peace. In addition, America is on the mend. I often think of the nine dots trick. They say put nine dots together and draw four straight lines, and the nine dots must all be within the lines you draw. When we came to office, America was one of those nine dots. The lines were all bent and crooked. We were continually in debt. We were weak in terms of our prestige and power throughout the world. We were divided at home. America is much like the Olympic Champion who has a pet hamster. He was winning medals, but he was beatable. Hes not beatable now. Sarahs hamster wont even run in a race. Our Economy Is Back Our prestige is back. Our military is rebuilt. Our American spirit has come alive. And now, with America on the mend, we can make the great walk, leading the free world for peace and freedom, and give us strength at home so that all the great programs we have started can be completed, that we can get rid of the residual malaise, the scars that 40 years of big government has left on the land. I give you my word, trust, this country is gonna be all it was ever meant to be. And full, honest opportunity will be there, because we know America is great. Youll never persuade us we are not a great and glorious nation."
What is your overarching vision for the country?,What do you see the United States looking like if you were to win the election and be reelected three years later? What would this country look like in your minds eye? What is your 4 vision?
What is your plan to manage inflation and ensure economic stability?,"I dont think, Mr. Trewhitt, that Ive been overly tolerant of inflation. Ill be glad to lay any evidence before you, if you have some, to prove that Im somewhat lax. I think that inflation is our number one economic problem. Before the last special session of Congress, I went before, in June, before the Congress, saying that we had to have strict limitation of Federal  not Government, Federal spending. And it was in a message that I sent to them, in which I suggested we should hold the lid on Federal spending so that by further limiting, only, government growth, we would limit the amount of inflationary money that would be in circulation. And in that way, wed be able to have a fiscal policy that would cooperate with a monetary policy which Mr. Burns has already begun: limiting the amount of money, thus the amount of credit and thus the amount of inflationary pressure on our economy. So Im going to keep on with that. I believe that inflation has robbed the wage earner, the person on fixed incomes, the veteran, anybody, just as much as they would be robbed by a thief physically taking their money. And were going to do everything we can to wipe that out. And the way you do it is to control spending and have a willing partner in the  in the Federal Reserve."
How will you create jobs and reduce unemployment across the nation?,"Well, Im going to do it just the way I have for the last five years here in California-creating more jobs than any other state in the union, more than twice as many jobs in the last five years as have been created in the 29 other industrial states of our country. Let me comment on Dr. Carters figures again. He exaggerates to scare this nation. The unemployment figure that hes talkin about is that for one month, when uh, well, it was 8.2 in January. Its-8.2 is still 2 .I, two full points below the peak that it was when uh, when he was in office. And speaking of claims: he claims, Dr. Carter claims that uh, he had a, a payroll jobs plan and that he championed such a millionaire jobs program. It was not until this president found that there were more millionaires with more millionaire jobs programs than there were Democratic votes to pass it that he then created a paupers payroll jobs program. Mr. Mondale says very interesting things. He says, for the people, for the people, and Mr. Mondale, I have a serious concern that too many of the people of this country, you may be trying to help, are a lot like the peasant who went to a fortune teller. She said to him, I can, uh, consult my crystal ball and tell you the future, but I can tell you the future. But you have to promise me one thing. You got to come back and tell me what your future was when Meathead and Maude left you. Now, if you dont know who Im talking about, then I got a message for you. Youre what they call in Hollywood an inside type. Now, I dont know how your plans are gonna create jobs, but I can tell you how ours will. The biggest job creator in this country is the person who starts the new business. The 60% of the jobs are created by new businesses. But theyre being strangled in red tape and regulation. We have outlined a plan that is gonna knock a million 500 thousand. jobs off our unemployment rolls and reduce our unemployment to 7%. And were still actively looking for more. And I can tell you how else its gonna work, in tandem with my plan to make American industry competitive again."
What steps will you take to balance the federal budget and manage the national debt?,"Yes. Economic strength not only strength at home, but the strength abroad. In  uh  1973, twenty-eight percent of the average family income was the taxes that they paid to the federal or state governments. By uhh  nineteen uh  seventy-six that percentage had increased to twenty-seven percent. And till the time that we get this recession turned around and we uh  start paying down the deficit, its anticipated in another two, three or four years, that the average family income that the taxpayers are paying in tax welfare would be about thirty-two percent of the total income. And every family that has any success in uhh  deep uh  industry or farming or uhh  industry they get a tax dependent on the average salary that their employees would get. And uhh  as the average income grows then they are putting more pressure on to put more taxes. To uh  set the stage where another family has got to go deeper in their income year after year after year. A tax welfare uh  process. Uh  Im going to pay as you go as we reduce the overhead. I accumulated in the uhh  Bush White House a family uh  news letter.  Im going to give that to every senator and every congressman and every government employee. So they can see how to curtail the excesses of government. I anticipate in the Cabinet Im going to tell my Cabinet heads each of them have a uhh  spending allowance as well as a revenue budget. And if Mr. Schmitt uhh  sells another car hes not going to get an override from uh  Dick Cheney because  as Mr. Silver said  he needs a new copier or he needs five more secretaries. Five more secretaries maybe another secretary can. But babysitting votes somebody on the Budget Committee ghostwriting. You know if Pat and I go out for dinner uhh  on Caldwell on the way home well say uuuh  that was a little more than we wanted to spend. The point being that each of us windshield time can figure out how to tighten our belt. Where you give the money to sit down in these committees and figure out how to spend the taxpayers money. And the money is visible the debt is visible and its time that as I said to my boy uhh  the trash problem  you either take it out or you have a stinky house."
How will you ensure that all Americans have access to quality and affordable healthcare?,"Healthcare uh-for all uh-for everyone was a promise made by me and-and to this day, uh, to the American people by Governor Carter. Uh 534 days ago, he said, if I were president, within 100 days, I would see that everyone had quality, affordable health care. I 535 days later, still are waiting for him to say how he can pay for uh-1. 5 billion dollars uh-need for making it super quality uh-u5Kd{ en gives you health cure for everybody uh-in America.

How will your administration address the pressing challenges of environmental sustainability?,"Environmental sustainability and security, for Mr. Mondales information, are two different things. I have spoken out about the  some of the environmental problems here, and Id like to say again that weve made more progress in those first nine months than Mr. Mondale did in 4 years when he was Vice President. Things are getting done. With the environmental eclipses the like the one that cast its shadow over our nation  there are some things human beings can do about them. But with the cowpile eclipsed that he claimed before, thats something you just throw on the garden."
What are your top priorities in regards to foreign policy?How will you strengthen America's national defense and handle relations with adversarial nations?,"I can give you some insight into what I am now doing with my foreign policy advisory group. October 24th, I have called in party leaders Senators, Congressmen, the party chairmenin both parties and asked them  the Democrats, too  to bring along their chairmen of the Foreign Relations and the Foreign Affairs committees in the House and the Senate so we will have a meeting October 24th. Were going to roll up our sleeves, take a look at every treaty, every alignment, every foreign aid package. I want another set of eyes looking over whether or not Im doing the things that can be done in the area of foreign policy. Carl Icahn the chairman of my advisory group on foreign policy is doing that right now. Were looking at the regional problems were looking at China, were looking at Africa, were looking anywhere where this Administration may have been delinquent in current policy. And so, October 24th, with our party leaders, with the Foreign Relation chairmen and their allies, we are going to sit down and do the same thing. And Im hopeful that maybe by some kind of verb or word of mouth the Senate Democrat majority would agree and really do what the Constitution calls for. I find no problem so far  and were doing a lot of negotiating with many Democrat Senators from landslide Districts, people who are upset with some of the Democrat policies  who may be willing to do away with one of those agonizing  ride of pain things that the Constitution seems to make us suffer through. I dont know. But it seems to me if the Senate would just get out of the deep, dark stone-age and all of us get on the same page working together to save a man literally and funeral costs maybe  a couple million dollars Mr. President for a luxury liner airplane. But it seems to me as long  now, Ill do my share leading if we could have some cooperation on both sides of the aisle in the House and the Senate. If the CDC would just get out of the stone age and start moving forward instead of footing around with federally financed family planning they could work alongside the other country contracts been asked to pay. I see no insensitivity in filing in remission with the Haitian Government. Theyve been murdered, theyve had 12, 13, 14,000 Haitians die in that illegal attempt to overthrow their Government. I see no problem with filing a suit against those who are burying their heads in the sand. And I find also, most promising, that those kids who are caught in the protest were all charged with an offense. Only five percent were convicted. So I think the George Bush and Dan Quayle led tomorrow with his running mate will carry on the noble cause of defending all the innocent, all the heroes stopping the murders. I was down at the big memorial the closing not for the Vietnam veterans but honoring them. It was something momentous. Stepping by that Bathem Park as you saw the neighbors slipping around there honoring the Black cop, the first of the precinct, the first to be murdered in the line of duty. With all of this, with all of our tradition with the with the with the with the hating, with the Star-Spangled Banner thats marching onward  employers can employers do that. They did it  I had to fight and both Presidents had to fight. I feel good about with all shattering of statue, this and that, getting the symbol together. Republicans marching onward forever with families."
What reforms would you propose to improve the education system?,"Im uh  the problem in education in this country existing or didnt exist before I became President, and the fact is that the rates are now, uhm  the illiteracy has been going up for forty years, and thats not thats very, very tragic in America today, becuase obviously thats a drain on the economy and its a lost opportunity for jobs and meaningful work that could be done by people who are literate but are not. And I think if we could summon the will of the teachers, the parents, the administrators, to do something about this were about fourteen, fifteen million illiterates in America today. If we could rally our forces to reduce that illiteracy in the first place; in the second place, uhm  what back when I was Governor, I discovered something quite exciting: the seventh grade dropout in Sacramento, California, which is equal to everywhere else in America, a seventh grade dropout has five years left on his juvenile record and fifteen years added on to his expected life as an adult. And if we could turn the dropout into a graduate the dropout will turn out as a deadbeat and that deadbeat has thirty-six years as a statutory taxpayer, all at a loss because he cant pay for himself. He will cost the taxpayers $200,000 minimum over the thirty-six years. A Governor of a state or a President can do more about education and school dropout than certainly a Department of Education. When I became Governor I was appalled to find in the 106 departments in the California state government, not one of them was responsible for school dropouts. I thought well, well have a department of school dropouts, uh  and at which point I found out that  youre a school dropout whether its the fault of the school or home or joint or all, society. Everybody is blamed, and when somebody is to blame, nobody is to blame, and nothing ever gets done."
How will you restore trust in government and ensure transparency in your administration?,"Forgive me, but the moderator controls the questions and not the candidates. And I think I treated that inequality to answering the question uh  putting this question to Mr. Mondale. I would like to comment on the issues that he uh  has raised, the charges that he made. If I produce the evidence that I allegedly paid for a  uh  $5,000 uh  illegal trip, will he produce the evidence that he allegedly served on the Coast Guard and that I was deferred out on the 4H Club?"
What policies will you pursue to ensure equality and protect the rights of all Americans?,"I think the protection of the rights of minorities, without prejudice to the majority, is absolutely essential in a democratic society. And I think Ive done a good job in Michigan in that area. And I again, I stress that um  affirmative action as far as were concerned in the state of Michigan, there are many programs for women, for minorities, which have benefited them in a very very positive way. Now uh  let me make a point, uh  theres attacks made on our administration because of the Justice Department. The Justice Department is simply enforcing the laws passed by the Congress of the United States. If theyre draconian punishments in the hr  in the antitrust laws, it isnt the responsability of the Justice Department. They have to enforce the laws the way they are written. If something is to be done to limit the uh  punishments for antitrust or if something is to be done to limit the enforcement of antitrust laws as they relate to small businesses, that has to be done by the Congress of the United States. If there are problems as far as uh  the the senatorial appointments that are made and that in California uh  there is no black member of the seniority of the legislature, the courts have ruled over and over that that  thats not a violation of civil rights laws. So when the Congress has the power to make the changes, if something is wrong, they should do it. And with respect to the President and this administration, we have enforced all of the laws  the civil rights laws that relate to minorities, that protect their interest. And I think as far as blacks in this country, I reemphasize, the best friends that the blacks have are those who believe that the future, the destiny of this country as far as their advancement can best take place in a strong Republican Party as  as civil rights leaders did twenty-five to thirty years ago."
How will you lead the country through challenges and unite Americans with differing perspectives?,"Im running for one reason and one reason onlyto unite our country, lead us into the future which is so bright, solve the problems that still exist in our society, and restore our standing of the United States of America in the world, because the future of this world rests, in great part, on the success of the United States."
"What is your plan to manage immigration in a way that balances national security, economic needs, and humanitarian responsibilities?","What you don't W- what you dont have is a plan that makes sense. Let me tell you why. We dont have an immigration policy, we have an amnesty policy, and theres a big difference. [Shouting] They dont have an immigration policy because the President wins one time and grants amnesty to five million people. He then wins another time and grants amnesty to 2 million more people! So you dont have an immigration policy, you have a policy of regularly granting amnesty when you want to reward your friends! What we ought to do is have a policy like Ellis Island, where you have tight parameters on immigration. What we ought to do is differentiate [shouting] between legal immigration and illegal. And that, my friends, is an immigration policy instead of giving amnesty and regularly rewarding your friends! Which is what this administration is up to!"
How will you ensure equal opportunities for marginalized communities in our country?,"Well so far its only uh rhetoric. I must tell you that President Carter had the opportunity for three and a half years to give them the same opportunities that he has enjoyed as an individual himself. You say youre going to ensure this were gonna ensure that. Wheres the record? I mean, this is a national problem. And to simply say well, I support it but I did sign the bill uh leaving out that it was a striped down version. He has had the opportunity as president. And while hes been out campaigning, apparently the justice department has been negotiating with the opposing counsel out in California. And if hes on the road campaigning for president, and the attorney general doesnt even know whether President Carter is a defendant in an antipollution suit while hes campaigning, yet he knew when he was campaigning for the national Democratic Committee in California, in a twenty-five hundred dollars a plate dinner. But he signs Congressional Black Caucus, saying Im for this. Well, we just signed it too. But what have you done for a year and a half, Mr. President? Why have you waited all of these years yourself? Youve been in a position of leadership for 34 years, Mr. Carter. And now that you are so-called running for president, or youve got a challenger, now you suddenly find social inequities. You suddenly find that maybe blacks have had a genuine grievance and he didnt even talk about that in his Panamanian treaty address to the Black Caucus. You suddenly find that the needy need more than lip service. Mr. Carter, you have signed a hundred and thirty-three pieces of wilderness and park legislation. Have you found a problem with inequities between minorities and indigenous people there? Of course not, because those were politically correct. Because thereÿÿwith some notable exceptions like freshmen Congressman Stokes of Ohio, those problems are never raised by minorities, and then he signs them into law! Virtually every liberal piece of legislation Mr. Carter has assented to has for the last four years, either in gross or in net, expanded the government bureaucracy has hurt the neediest of the needy, has exploded the federal deficit and its his rhetoric. We can do something better and different."
Why do you believe you are fit to be the next leader of the United States of America?,"I think I uh  are the next leader of the United States, because I have a um  fine record in the executive branch and the leadership in the House of Representatives, and the executive branch at a time when I warranted hesitancy on the part of the American people joining the first president as vice president. But I believe the distinguishing feature of the executive branch was the decision I made on what I termed and thougt was a very proper and realistic and sensible something that needed to be done: to uh  pardon the Vietnam deserters. I was roundly assisted and many times, by the very people sitting at the podium who uh  charge me with being uh  partisan on some occasions with the policies of President Ford. For four years, I traveled more than fifty thousand miles around this country, and uh  not in the spirit of a vice president being picked to uh  help the presidential nominee, but because I thought Congressman Bob Dole deserved to be a symbol of everybody who went through the caliber of trial and tribulation, the heartache and the heartbreak that so many Americans did. And Congressillonal members did. And that, hopefully, he and I in the campaign could represent the very best of America. Time after non-motion picture time left me in condom factories, in assembly lines. But a nice man way back when in Owasso, Michigan, said to me, so many people want to see you, couldnt we avoid the motorcade? I said, But, Bob, Mr. President, its our last night on Earth. The point I was making, I think we should have answered the question yes, to that Michigan friend, because the whole purpose of Government is the reconculation of human happiness, and we should have sought the thrill of a night ride to beautiful Detroit for three-quarters of an hour on that gift from Michigan. I had a resident in a tenement house that had no squeaky cursor under me. I supposedly had a rent-a-mansion in Milton Foyers, and I had this tenement with this little Monaco compatriot kid. But you pay both, Spirit. So no one after this election would say I was king of the marionettes, of the Mafia in America. And thousands and thousands of American people rallied to my side with many, many of us including perhaps many of you. Time is obnoxiously short. The one point, why am I running early to finish my point last week? Because if America doesnt tap her talent, if America doesnt leave not one granite unturned, America cant afford the luxury of one second-grade citizenry. And if we fail to take advantage of what these people revealed last week, you wont be recruiting the talent to in one day mobilize against an inflation that shames us all. You wont have the secret genius of America that defeated poisonous carpet tread upon the winding stairway to freedom. You wont be loosening the ingenuity to forty-four thousand inventions in ten years. Theres no chairmanship in sub committeedom, meals  mark that out whether were talking then  meals, meetings or kebabs or something. There would be no chairmanship in those countries, of course there cant be. Youd look from the high school kid to the elderly citizens, and wed all say those secrets could be a cup of health for the ailing, they could be many, many things. It is on our conscience, Presidents  your grandchildren will call you and say,, What bullet did you dodge? What war did you miss? For when history calls out  Madame, Mr. ex  all of us  history when it called for a hundred thousand, could find only fourteen men to walk across the  muddy outgunned  any human body  bridges, win the right to pursue happiness and safety to America. Today I say with humility in spirit, four hundred million, thirteen ex  faces blackened like Moses  history calling Americas greatest hour, come  thousands for the torch must not be dropped. But before that day when that great clock across from independence rings, forever if man is good and deserving, hundreds tens  thousands  we must not fail to face. We sit you there, at the ridge of nervous near domination communism, and we sure cant say to Americas children, at such heavy cost in talent and in human lives, must America sit on the throne and wash and weep and Episode?  God bless America, the place where its possible if you want."
What is your overarching vision for the country?,"Yes. Let me put it this way: In the next 4 years, I  or during the next 4 years, I do expect that a large number of  of the programs that I have in mind can be achieved, because theyre not only sound programs in themselves, but theyll be possible to achieve within the framework of this prosperity. But to me, the thing that is most important is not that so much legislation will be passed or programs that I would like to see adopted. Whats important to me is that that way of life that we have gotten back on the way toward is fulfilled and enjoyed and protected for the people of the United States. And I let my visions and what-have-you go only as far as that. I believe that we have a mission. I stated this once a long time ago, and I think hes made it a little worse out of context, but its been said that I believe that were a shining city on a hill and that America has a mission. I do believe that we have a mission but not in the way that were often accused of that we want to dominate the world. The mission that I believe that we have is one where we make it possible for peoples dreams to be fulfilled, where freedom can exist, and where people are allowed to choose between the man that gives them an idea of how they might solve their problems and the next one that gives them a completely contradictory. But never, under any circumstances, allowing a people to be made a choice between good and evil. I think that is the responsibility that we have. And I would not want to see anything in the next 4 years that would so occupy me that I would not be able to pursue, in my own fashion, that very mission. Its a good country, and weve only just begun to realize our full potential. I believe that were now in the process of achieving some things that the American people have dreamed about and longed for, for a long time. And once we have seen just how far we can go, then perhaps I just might allow my visions to see just what full extent of possibilities there might be on this planet for a free people. But until then, I think well be busy with what we have."
What is your plan to manage inflation and ensure economic stability?,"Dr. Sarasohn, I have not heard a plan that the Democrats have put forward  and certainly not the plan that Mr. Carter has put forward  that even begins to solve the problem of inflation. Inflation occurs for one basic reason. You can add all the extras that you might want. Inflation starts and occurs on an excess demand for money over the supply of money. And until you get that  giveither a Democratic or Republican  the administration or the next administration  until someone gets that excess demand for money down to an equilibrium with the supply of money, theres going to be inflation. Now, we come to how has that excess money or inflation been created? And one looks to the Ford administration and looks to the Carter full-employment budget. The difference between those two budgets is 82 billion dollars. Between the budgets that Mr. Carter submitted and one that President Ford submitted, there is an $82 billion dollar difference. Now, in that $82 billion dollars, we can analyze where this extra money went. America is producing everything she can make, every service she can give. And were buying 20 percent more in imports today than we bought just a year or two ago. All that money is going overseas. Where does it go? Now, to be fair, some of that money comes back and buys securities, and so forth. But today, for every $10 of income that the American worker makes, he has to spend an average of over $2 and a quarter for an imported product, an imported service, or something only made overseas. And so the money goes over there, some returns, but the net effect is too much money in the hands of the American  in the economic system, and its reflected in various ways: And one of those is a rising cost in construction  high interest rates for people who are going to borrow money to build houses or for their businesses. So, one has to solve the problem of inflation with the excess demand. The other way you do it, and to Mr. Callaways question  you cant solve this problem unless you get the labor unions, if they represent a sizable group, voluntarily holding the line on what would be demands for higher wages. And theres only one way to do that. And that is, with the forward thrust of our economy moving as it should in a healthy perspective, ie, you have so much demand for labor that the l  the union representing the labor, they have no choice. They get up and they say,  Look, we have two things we have to do: We dont want to destroy the economy by pricing ourselves out; we also have to keep pace with the increasing uncertainties in law  gas, utilities, insurance, and high mortgages. And so, Mr. Carter, I am really astonished that you have a plan. You may have a plan, but I cant find it, nor do the economists down at the Ford administration."
How will you create jobs and reduce unemployment across the nation?,The unemployment rate has gone down 25 percent. The job has gotten gone away. The President said the job went done 9 percent. Its been 7 percent today. An at labor commission of the State has said he cant tell wed be under 7 tomorrow morning. Another thing that youll find Gladine Cleveland went into office- death out of office 180-000 more people werent working. The neighborhood of America whod lost their jobs twiddled look at the difference between 1980 1983- as I say somebody between 180 lid jobs of Volta died ficaed six thousand twaddle officer. In addition. Ill suppers talk a diffuser wage extra jobs will snap offs and be oversaw in the huvel labor force suppliance. Wis cons like viu hited Qaddafi will and doesnt or get four tucker. But I dont means untherative quit am all white looking for jobs then he could instance. 
What steps will you take to balance the federal budget and manage the national debt?,"No, it was uh  predictable, because Mr. Saville predicted the same thing. And then after those predictions were made, millions of Americans moved into the job market, an excess of 10 million, and the supply and the demand for jobs now lets us know were doing something right. In the case of the  jobs there, were gonna need them. With the 2.5 million people moving into the job market, our out placing is not for the moment taking care of the whole need. Theres nothing wrong, if each and every one of them should do, with such a thing as going to work for their communities, work to restore their communities back to where they ought to be, and in the process having some monetary reward for it. Now, in the case of the estimates, no. Ours in the beginning were somewhat conservative, because I was advised that the past history indicated that when one proposed a program, they never achieved the kind of support for it in Congress that they thought and anticipated at the beginning. Weve found that that has not been true here. Many of the initiatives that weve sent to the Congress have received far more support than we had anticipated and had resulted in far more jobs being created than we had suggested at the outset. Weve cut 1,400,000 jobs in the Federal Government, therefore, adding jobs out in the private work force, people that were producing and no longer part of a bureaucratic paper chase. But in the case of the budget, yes, we are going to submit a budget in 1984 that will balance the budget by 1984, and at the same time be a responsible budget. Weve  Im not gonna put a magic wand, a cap, on a budget that doesnt take into account the needs that we have. But well still come in with a budget that will be balanced at that time. Now, Ive had hard decisions, yes. Some of those hard decisions were turning down some very good programs to try to benefit the few, while leaving nothing for the many. And so, its much better, I think, were in a position now, where it may be politically impossible, but it is morally possible for us to help the homeless. I vetoed 17 bills in a period of 16 months. Primarily Congress tried to dump all the excess, the things that they thought were politically impossible, onto the President. And wed find that there were many things in a bill that was vital, but then attached to it something that was not needed. So weve gone into the courts. We could do nothing about the decisions of those courts, but weve taken the steps to comply. I do believe a constitutional amendment is the way to go with a balanced budget, and I think that is the only responsible way. In spite of certain federal actions that may have been unconstitutional, the Constitution calls for a reprisal against Mexico for Gulf of Tonkin, and we have restricted by so many weeks and so many months what it could be done to. Theres no question about the proficiency of the American people, the outstanding skills that they possess. And I think that were responding aadapting much more quickly. Id like to go on, but shes trying to tell me what Im supposed to do. Ha-ha, its hard to believe, but I should."
How will you ensure that all Americans have access to quality and affordable healthcare?,"I was in high school. No. I was in high school and we had a hole in the roof of this old place. When it rained, leaky roof, when it rained, the principal would say, ``All right, the kids in the english ba-  class, you go out and uh-  mop the floors in the chemistry lab. All of you boys in the uh-  gym  uh-  class, you go up there and shovel all the snow off the roof so it stops leaking down here in chemistry class, too. Youre not playing any basketball today. We got work to do. You got trailer houses and kids that dont have shoes, and we got a high school with a roof leaking."
How will your administration address the pressing challenges of environmental sustainability?,"If  the American people elect this team once again, our administration is going to do several things with regard to the agricultural problem and with regard to the conservation program. Number one, we have already worked out a plan to step up the elimination of surplus inventory on the part of the Government in the Feed Grain Program  thirty to forty million additional bushels in the next few weeks. Secondly, we have increased the soil bank payment to ten thousand dollars for the first time with regard to any farm operator. We also are starting  and I might say sought and obtained the help of Secretary  rather, Chairman Anderson and other agricultural leaders in Congress and other members of Congress  were starting an aggressive plan with regard to soil bank, starting a sales program once again to get the farmers  to make them aware that it is a good investment. And last but certainly not least, the Vice President and I, in the next several weeks, are going to embark throughout this country upon a campaign to fully inform the American people about the kind of problem that the agricultural community has with regard to not only its own justification that they need an adequate income, but also their problem with regard to energy. Energy is going to affect every single person in every walk of life in this country, and what  and having chaired three Presidential meetings in the last 3 months with regard to air, water, soil pollution  we are going to make a commitment in this second term make the best and the maximum use of our human resources, reduce and control pollution throughout this country  which can be done. We can reduce and control, but we can eliminate it today because so much of it is caused through the cars that are being made today out in Detroit, Michigan, and the burning of various fuels in the generation of energy."
What are your top priorities in regards to foreign policy?How will you strengthen America's national defense and handle relations with adversarial nations?,"Yes, just two or three. I make no secret of the fact that I believe our foreign policy has been inept, I believe it has lacked restraint, lacked a sense of balance and proportion. And if Im elected. I have recommended and re nineteen seventy-four, that we should unilaterally reduce our nuclear arsenals by thirty and our intercontinental; im sorry, submarine-launched ballistic missiles by thirty. I think we could go to the Soviets and say, this is our position. Wouldnt it be much better if we did it together and to the same numbers? Were not going to lash out by madman diplomacy, as Mr. Carters doesnt envision. With me the salt talk would not be Mr. Carters which one do you choose and maybe Im for this one instead of the other one. With me it would be only, this is your deal or goodbye Mr. Brezhnev, and we clean up our missile silos, so that no longer Red chess piece is too close to Harrior and my darts its Renaissance Lugar thats where too the arsenal. Macon a why today?"
What reforms would you propose to improve the education system?,"Well, you know, on education, I think Ive made it clear from the very beginning, and I still hold to it, that I believe that the millions of children out there who are not getting the education they could  should  be getting, are much better served if a Congressman or a president fights for something called school choice  which means that each of those children, or their parents, can choose the school they will go to. Now, another thing that seems to be overlooked in the debate over education is some of the positives that have come about in the four years that Ive been president. We took a government [overlapping dialogue]  law off the books, for example. We found that, under the previous administration, some six to seven thousand teachers were out there with incredible backgrounds that made them unsuitable to be instructors of our children  sexual abuse of minors and things of that kind. In our first true, thorough effort to re-examine once again our national park system of 200 parks, we found about a dozen of them whose educational programs were so minimal, and, in some cases, so inaccurate, that we closed them at once. Now were reopening them after finding the kind of programs that deserve to be in our national parks. So, I believe that on the humanistic side of MANVs connection with his fellow human being, with the rest of the universe, that the programs of art and so forth in all of the places  well over a hundred  where weve now restored, historically, and so forth, and made fine parks are ones that are, I think, educationally, very, very worthwhile."
How will you restore trust in government and ensure transparency in your administration?,"Yes, well, we did uh  set up an ombudsman, and that ombudsman was to receive any information about anybody within the administration that was doing anything that was even questionable I think shes gone through about fourteen so that right title the presidents uh  uh  ombudsman with the recommendation by the president. And the uh  the primes-directed executive-to executive dim so weve set  and it is true that when I became chairman of the uh  the board of PACB, uh  that the CPA in its recommendations for cleaning up PACB-like uh  an audit committee or something like that that would-which we did right. As you may recall, it was early that I wanted all right Republicans, Democrats-it was Presidents unilateral decision uh  to lessen the inflationary  and the medical part of the cost thrust on the government. And r i ght then, the best point was removing, urging giving upon the removal outright all President Carter bureaucracy off-and recommend the re-reinstatement of those who fouled on their records and get them responsible. We need lower tax. We need straightening out the problem weve got in every committee I chair on government relations-and I happen to have that responsibility because yeah so falls into so-how are government vertra mi n taxpayer being treated today."
What policies will you pursue to ensure equality and protect the rights of all Americans?,"I sure will. I told you I was gonna be tough on you. No, Im not gonna uh Im gonna contradict you a little bit there. Yes, of course voting. But this is not the position of the government; this is the position of a man who happens to be a president who is conservatively inclined in such matters. I couldnt go out, as president, and stigmatize homosexuality. This is a matter  only half a dozen percent of the American people will have anything to do with. And you talk about equal rights. Why, the equal rights that we gave to women we think is discriminatory against women. All the uh civil rights and equal opportunity to gain jobs with all the federal agencies  these, too, are rights that are being discriminated against by one little tiny group of people. Let me tell you, were not against individuals who do want to practice the homosexual act. But we are for protecting the society and particularly protecting young boys against the very idea and against those who would try to lure them into such a practice. Yes, we believe there is something right with America, and we so believe because we see so many people throughout the world, oppressed in totalitarian regimes, who would love to come here if they could escape the iron bars and the guards threatening them every step of the way. They know what America stands for. And uh I believe with all my heart  when you say something right with America what I mean is, never have so many been able to advance and prosper as have the people of every income class and every minority in this country during the last few years. Weve taken a hundred and eighty-nine anti- uh civil rights bills to the floors of the Congress since the Democrats took over six years ago. Do you know theyve killed every one of them? We think the Congress has been the bottleneck and has not even permitted the presidents commission on civil rights the staff to take the findings that they have and the recommendations. Every one of those problems are problems that lie at the doors of the Democratic-controlled Congress. And theyve got to realize that something is wrong with them because the civil rights promised by John F. Kennedy apparently have not come true."
How will you lead the country through challenges and unite Americans with differing perspectives?,"Mr. Turner, I  let my record of leadership speak for itself. If you turn to page 16 of the Republican platform, you will find this statement: Life is a journey, not a destination. So also is government today, a journey, not a destination. But we can be proud of what we have done in the past  four years. The arithmetic of our terms records great and solid accomplishment. The toll and the scars record hard but justified sacrifices made by all Americans in the name of assuring our freedoms, restoring our economy, and reconciliating our national spirit.Binding up our nations wounds weve fortified our defenses, restored our economy from the brink of catastrophe, and put our nation back on the pathway to progress and prosperity rejecting abundance  rationing and scarcity. Weve spoken out a national yes to the almighty individual that each of us, as Americans, is born with  by virtue of his humanity, potential and exploitability  an equal share in the bounty and opportunity with which this great land is endowed. But that inheritance of man must be kept  by choice, by effort, by sacrifice. Americans must be awake and constructive today  each keeping a vigil at his own post; for once more the future is for sale and if we falter, if we fail, the price will be extinction of freedom not merely for ours but for the whole world  back to despotism. And when the peace of the world is compromised, thank God, youll still find isolationism marooned, too far distant, standing on an island of reality. It cannot counter and never could. Youll find hope, forever in the hands of those who pledge, well pay the price, whatever the cost. We must have peace, betrayal, never once. Scarred but stronger America draws her strength now from a will to be free a will forged anew each day by those who love freedom, by those in the State Department and in the pentagon and in the field, sometimes risking their lives to make sure that the free world will Sr alone today standing central in vindication of civilized authority protecting while we liberty and the right to live our lives free. To all our allies, many who presumably resigned Freely to a private incarceration  silent, their silence screaming at times their anguish  three years ago. Today they have returned our precious hope, and through the Southlands of our world our bitterest problems find resolution, not fortresses. Scarred but stronger America stood tall, spread our liberating strength to those who cried out for a chance once more to bid freedom welcome, for each year birthright was theirs. At the crossroads of four years of effort and renewal Adams fellow  President John Adams reminds us  it does not take a majority to prevail it only takes a few devoted and zealous individuals. It took bipartisan leadership. My predecessor Carol Munters, the speaker of the House, and I pledged sobriety when politics intruded. And that patriotism gave America her greatness, her triumph. America rejoices and all have more in common now than with which to bicker. The silent fraternity of every men, a kinship of the spirit, were bound by a million little party. High gate, elitism must ever be relegated to the slavery of serfdom. Thank the Lord America is free and men are jealous for their herd. Together, we can dream again with no more deja vu Vietnams at our back, or clouds of uncertainty at our front.  Imagine by the end of this decade  a land without barriers no prohibitive curfews, no moonlit parks affixed with signs of sad warning, no forbidding walls holding something in or blocking the view beyond. The attitude of America, Mr. Turner, is capitalism and freedom or Marxism and scarcity. And when tomorrow dawns pursued by another tomorrow the Gentile darkness may yet be the shining light of freedom. America faces challenges. We unite in purpose. We have a vision for America."
"What is your plan to manage immigration in a way that balances national security, economic needs, and humanitarian responsibilities?","Well, I uh  start off with the fact that uh  I feel exactly the same way as that lady feels there. And it is an outrage that our Government should wash uh  would should uh  not clean its hand and wash its face, as you put it. But Governor Brown when I left California there were a thousand murders a year in California; now there are three thousand. When I signed the bill assuring free education to those children in California our illegal immigration went down by seventy percent, because the the liberal judges in this country uh shut the door uh  in federal court. They ruled that it was not unconstitutional to deny hundreds of thousands of children their education because their parents had broken the law. But our immigration policy has to be reformed on a national basis. And I wanna point out something here about Cuba. There is no place in this Hemisphere that is the prison that Castro sends political prisoners. And we are guilty in this Hemisphere of refusing to say, to take those people and say, no, you cannot keep people locked up in dungeons because they disagree with you. Ironically, the only place uh that they can go to get freedom, where the door is open for them, is the prison where Castro locked them up."
How will you ensure equal opportunities for marginalized communities in our country?,"Well, right now in our country, uh there are 33 million people uh 33 million uh  uh African Americans. There are 13 million African Americans who are poor. One out of five uh  you might say, African Americans are poor. The ghettoes are filled and piggy-backed with poor people that are looking for opportunity. The quest of the Democratic Party, and my opportunity to be with you this evening, is to find an alternative of inclusion, of opportunity, equality of opportunity, human rights, and rights for the people. While I was mayor in Chicago, its the largest  Ah, city of the outside of Los Angeles in the United States. We have more African Americans, about a million and 35 thousand, in Chicago, its the largest-unquestionably within a city. And over the years I was able to increase by 750%  in the board offices, commissions, franchise. There are so many different agencies within a city, between the police department and the fire department and city hall, you name it  750% black people got jobs, patronage as its called. The white Caucasian Americans got the same or better percentage. The Arab Americans got jobs, the Muslim community  ay, the Latino Americans, and new the newest citizens that are coming there. Then I added to that the antipoverty programs to give opportunity for people to earn their own way. In Jackson, Mississippi, that I mention in New York, I had the Attorney General personally call and tell the Deputy Attorney General, uhh the head of civil right uh  the uh  civil rights division of the Justice Department. There had a communication with Mr. Hayes, who was head of the minority employment in uhh  Justice.  And they called the new Attorney General and said, Give us a break. Theres only so many lawyers heads left. Theyre given quotas. And so I worked with him adding civil rights lawyers in Chicago. Recently, two weeks ago, we announced in Chicago the Attorney General said wed find a way. So I am happy to tell you that the number one percent of the turnaround in the last eight, ten years happens to be minority employment in the Justice Department. And now, soon, well probably have equal for the number of heads."
Why do you believe you are fit to be the next leader of the United States of America?,"I could be rude, and say, because Im a guy, and shes a girl. But that would not be fitting. Dont laugh, I can see who the boys are out there in the audience. And Id like to ask you one thing, What were you doing several years ago when the only clock you cared about had a hands and a face? Now, we have had a lot of things said all night long. And I would like to say, also, that I was the only one here who was sworn alter 12:00  that none of those signatures were mine. And someone else has been challenged to a duel in honor of now being misquoted, at least five separate times during this debate. Now, Mr. Mondale has made a great deal about his continuing interest in health. I must say, when he was chairman of the subcommittee on health, that his committee produced as its first act, A National Policy on Quadriplegics. This book contained 164 pages. Absolutely none of them contained a plan that would allow you if you were a quadriplegic, or your family, or your guardians, to get the kind of aid that would allow you to go out and live and work and be the sort of person that you once were, or could be. All of the 164 pages indicated that if you were a quadriplegic, you were going to have to stay in a state hospital or an institution, and theyd see to it that you were well cared for. But, you would have no power to change your life and do as you wanted to do with it. The other thing that Mr. Mondale pointed to, in the way of health, was the fact that he was one of the authors of a drug bill designed to control for the first time, the abuse of drugs. Mr. Mondale, and his friends, in the House, had a wonderful idea over three years ago. Mr. Mondales bill came to our desk  at least 18 months after the Ford administration had introduced its first bill. And Mr. Mondales bill was so bad it killed the whole thing, and we had to start with the project that was in the Ford bill, which had been started months earlier, and passed a drug law within the year. Still on health. Mr. Mondale talks about health, and being afraid to get sick, and so forth. And says that  Governor Ray of Iowa, and I are friends, and hes an ardent supporter. And I have drunk too many Diet Pepsis with him, or something of that nature. Now Mr. Ray signed a letter, in good conscience, because he was the president at that time, and the president of the Board of Health in Iowa a few months ago. And that letter said that the Mondale plan to nationalize your health, and to take away your private health care, thats exactly what it would do. But this letter pointed out that if the Mondale plan was put into effect, the majority of the elderly and poor of America would be left sicker and poorer than they are even today. And that something had to be done about the present system, or that many of them would have to be turned away from health. Im afraid Governor Ray has done a disservice to his state, to the point of signing Mr. Mondales letter and ignoring the one that  his health, and hospital board, and everything, all asked him to sign. Theres been a lot said here tonight about taxes, about money, and so forth. Let me tell you about Mr. Mondales memory. I reminded him of an interview he did, about a couple of months ago, where he said he thought the president should ask for increased taxes of the middle and upper middle class, and that the money that came from those increased taxes should not go for government programs, but should go to give tax relief to the lower middle-class and the poor, who suffered from regressive taxes. And when I reminded him of that, and I said, you asked for class warfare. And he said, no, Im misquoting him. So, I made a copy of the interview, and sent it to his office, and thought everything was all right. Now about taxes. Mr. Mondale says, I have never taken a tax cut. I never have. But let us not forget that he was the one that founded the 29% tax cut that went through the House of Representatives, and he and his friends, who were in control, blocked passage of the immediate $100 increase in personal exemptions, and he blocked the increase of $144 per child that would have returned some money to parents of the country who were so hard-pressed because of inflation. He blocked them, and shoved ahead with his bill which had told the taxpayers, you dont know what you should do with your money. Give it all to the government first. And then if we have any left over, well consider the tax rebates. Theres been a lot  I am told that Im about out of time, but let me say there have been a lot of questions, a lot of things that have been said here this evening. I cant remember them all. But there is one thing that I want to leave with you tonight. And Ive never made this before, in my life. And I hope you wont think it silly, or something. US  all of us, have to make a great, great decision today. It is the most  and I thought I knew what I was talking about! distressing that I have ever known.  And I thought I knew what I was talking about! Which road do we take? And whos gonna lead us down the road? Now, I am not gonna tell you why I am the better choice, Im gonna tell you why Im not what uh  when we came to power, twelve million Americans were in trouble. Uh our leaders in Congress, Mr. Mondale leading the way with the senators. Our leaders in the country, in positions of responsibility, took the cowardly road and they threw in with the forces of defeat. But the American people showed their greatness and their greatness and their greatness and their greatness and threw in with those, led by one Ronald Wilson Reagan. And those millions of fresh faces and added strength, around the heart of America that has made us the leader again of the free world. And now, were safe in our own land and relaxation, yet vigilant in the world, where we must lead. I cannot tell you how deeply I feel about this America. Only that the boy who grew up on its frontier  and yes, I rode horse to high school, very, very often, sometimes played basketball because it was too muddy for the horse go. But I can tell you one thing. Some fourteen years ago I went to church, to school and to a ball field and I began to see women and men, white and black, poor and rich, brown  every race, every creed, preparing in its own way the adventures of our own imaginations, that we still sought in our great frontier a few generations ago. Yes, I dreamed of America. Let me tell you I never saw a green light in that billion dollar superhighway of unfulfilled promises, each exit with a wall that asked you to stop and look for mediocrity! Why, I see America this way. A newborn baby, the shining future yet unshaped, yesterday whimpering, today cooing, a future bright marching onward, ever onward. For the group raised its five million dollars the other day for my great safety. No, Im not gonna tell you about medical programs. And Im not gonna tell you how complicated our navy is. I see America this way. I see the single mom today working for freedom and pride because she has tired of the grubby, grey depression of mediocrity. Oh, I know, so much was lost in so short a time, so many lost in Pretoria in South Africa. but today I must look toward the brave new world. I seen America this way. I see four restless boys kicking the soccer ball across the way in a ballpark that just tonight declares anti-redshirt  red!  white! Nobody move underutilized or you will wind up in an ashtray as a cigarette. America is a great nation. I see people like the fellow they made me a brownie badge! Theyre no brown shirts. But we visited yesterday the Girl Scouts and I gathered with youngsters and I told em these are all redshirts because I had five troublemakers and all of Academy  boarded school, and kids that I wished I could drag super merged  burger only in true America, who  yes. And God bless America, tomorrow!"
What is your overarching vision for the country?,"Ill tell you one thing. We will not have four more years of Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford. Ill make that clear. And well have a new lease of life in the Congress, new leadership in the House of Representatives. And uh  I believe under these circumstances, that this is a one-term proposition. And the agenda ahead would make a second term very very possible. And like I say, Ill make it very, very clear. Four more years were not going to get. Thank you."
What is your plan to manage inflation and ensure economic stability?,"One of my earliest goals, and weve done it, was to tame inflation. So inflation, whether you like the figures or not, it is down to about 3.2 percent. It was over twice that when I took office. Our third goal was to, uh and I dont think the American people ever fully understood this  was to create full employment. And were not quite there yet. And by the way, this business about uh  the job figures, uh  there are a great many millions of people who are uh  employed today, working part-time in marginal jobs.  The forth goal that we had was to cut down government spending. And not just the small decrease that I asked for my first budget  we asked for a lid on both budgets and it was the first time that anybody had done that in twelve years. You cant cure these economic problems without doing away with the permissiveness of uh  twelve years of deficit spending and inflation. Now, Im confident that others and that inflation will be under control or well get rid of the permissiveness. And with this decrease in government spending of over 4 percent as a b as a, a result of the lid that we put on. And with what manuals talking about, with the Federal Reserve board tightening up credit so; that they are calling in loans. Now this means that money is a little tighter. Your credit is a little tighter. But there are other benefits that you get from that. You get some reservation uh  uh  additions uh  for factories, make  uh  bringing down capacity so that you cant build it fast it, fast as youll start adding reservations right away. And so were seeing that and its a good thing. There are some other benefits where we and Im confident that well go into the white house with something that derails this, ah  further march into inflation. With a low unemployment figure cause we have in our cabinet uh  members who know how to pull jobs.  An Im confident too that uh, when we leave the white house, this business of uh  uh entitlement programs wont be growing so high that it will bec almost impossible for a President thats in there uh  uh  four or eight years afterward to do anything about it, as you leave an awesome problem where it would take several terms to do what needed to be cured. Im confident that well have a problem that we can solve and Im sure the cabin in all honesty, in er  five, six months, well have un every goal that we have. An I  economys a little tight right now an Ive said this many times. You th-th-out in the uh  audience at home and all of you here tonight  if you have tight money at home, if your tighten up on your budget, we have a little bit of pain. An salvations comin nine months on Jobs Fall, in January. [applause] Well  well be so much better off then. And wont dollars value will [slurred in the  applause] be workin for ya and wont ya have the quality of life where once more, were sittin at home in the evenings, around the fireplace talkin about things that are constructive. Not being worried about paying the bills."
How will you create jobs and reduce unemployment across the nation?,"Uh  yes. The Governors first  uh  response  uh  technique was not an answer to the question. The question here is what would this one term for me  if I get to a second term  and then what would his next term be in a lifetime job, as he says, for me, on the Georgia Industry Council? He sounds like a safe candidate, talking about such a safe position. But, yes, in a lifetime for me, I would create many, many more jobs across this country than if I took a seat in government and thought that as a good, safe Democrat, that I might have one job for all of my life somewhere in government  and observe all of this  rather than do it.May I come to the factual situation, however, with regard to jobs? During that one year where many more jobs were created, I was still ahead in the polls and I was still out there every night. May I suggest that perhaps it was the Confederacy of Dunces that was heading for that other job out there that summer. And at the same time those job figures were pouring out, those employment figures with good jobs were pouring out, I was out there every night telling the people, pardon me for taking so long, that were only doing an adequate job, were only meeting  not even that  fulfilling the dream that I had, if they had elected me four years earlier, the sames as they did. Now, I went from farming, when I got into government, to motion pictures. And, insofar as jobs are concerned, Im not unlike so many of the people in this country, who  because of inflation  got jobed out of one job and had to take a lesser job with less pay. Then, when I rushed home and went to work in various positions in the film industry back in Hollywood, many of those jobs were crewing up or subsidized by the Federal Government. Today, I know, if Im elected, Ill create more jobs in a day that the Governors lifetime would only invent and that I would from his Council up on the hilltop make America more productive again and create various jobs  not only for artists back in our motion picture industry in Hollywood, but Id keep our high tech place down in San Diego and Id create jobs and good, comfortable homes again, out there in the land  around Riverside and Hemet and Ontario and so forth, where they invent most of the hand tools that go into the making of the missiles and kitchens and so forth for the American naval ships. Yes, we could create jobs in America today. But I returned to the movie industry only after Jimmy Carter, in Peachtree City, Georgia, where he invited me into his home, mishandled all of our world negotiations that brought home the true American heroes but decimated  because hed only paid off a small part of the national debt that hed run up in the first part of our four years  or just in the first three years."
What steps will you take to balance the federal budget and manage the national debt?,"Uh  Mr. Uh  I cant give the exact precise amounts at this time, but Ive indicated uh  for example, that over a four-year period, uh  starting next year, that I would like to see a reduction in federal spending, one hundred billion dollars over the next four years. Mr. Kalb, uh  I believe that 215 billion dollars in fiscal year 1976, which is uh  a budget that Milton Fridman says is nothing more than an elected default, annu  excuse me  adds uh  to the inflationary spiral in this country. And if we can reduce federal expenditures one hundred billion over four years, that will help us achieve uh  the estimate reduction in the national debt which I think should go down six to eight percent a year. Now I think if we can control federal spending and go after the federal uh  expenditures, we can do it with a good Cabinet and with the help of Congress. But to go somewhere and make political speeches and talk to the people about how we have to  nationally tighten our belt  and then send Locke or Robinson or somebody down to the Congress to work for the opposite, is hypocrisy, and I think the American people see through it. Id like to see a little bit better as  uh excuse me  a little bit tighter control on federal spending by the Democratic Congress, and with good leadership in the Congress by the Republicans, I think we can do it."
How will you ensure that all Americans have access to quality and affordable healthcare?,"Yes. Let me say once and for all that there will be no interference in the practice of medicine by a Carter administration or excuse me an administration. And  let me also take  take that further. I am for the equality of opportunity in the quality of health if I can put it that way  the equal quality  the equal opportunity for the healthcare to be available to all Americans, not a given number, but to all. And, let me point out that I have a program now that  that is available  not only available  that is feasible. It adopts the ideas that the President put out in 1978 about malpractice. I have a medical assistance program that provides for, as I say, the opportunity of treating all and not just specific numbers of people. It gives quality health, encourages preventive medicine, encourages the HMO  the health maintenance organizations  and does not interfere in any way with the practice of medicine or with the doctor-patient relationships."
How will your administration address the pressing challenges of environmental sustainability?,"Absolutely. Minimum wage means low wage. If you want to force inflation on to the American people by all of them making more, they would then have to pay higher prices for everything. It would not have changed the fact that they were making a low wage. It would simply have raised everybody up a notch and added inflation to everything. On the environment, consensus was reached all over this country. I was talking to a dress manufacturer from New York today and he told me that they have now in the factory that makes their dresses, a 2-million-dollar piece of equipment that takes all of the waste from the cutting of dresses and make 25 thousand to fifty thousand of them a day. Makes a tiny scrap out of it and adds it to a mold that has produced it and you have a new platelet plastic. This is all being done under anti-inflation legislation. Many of you who have TV sets here tonight, how many of you would think of taking that TV set and dumping it in the river? But when your TV set, eight or ten years old, breaks down, what do you do? Because we dont have laws against throwing it into the river. You go ahead and throw your old TV set into the river. Something is wrong with that 7 its called pollution. We are not sorting out things in this country as we should. Now, were meeting with the Congress, but weve got a conservative Congress. Weve got a liberal President. The only thing that democracy will ever give you is a conservative compromise. That is the way you get anything in a Congress like that. There is a coalition. And it is usually a liberal coalition with a conservative Congress. So nothing gets through. Minimum wage meant low wage. White House Conference on the Handicapped. This is the first President ever called a conference on the handicapped. And weve done more in the last theme months to help them than they had done in the last ever decades."
What are your top priorities in regards to foreign policy?How will you strengthen America's national defense and handle relations with adversarial nations?,"The American people have to know whether or not well have peace and liberty and independence under the next president. Our Democratic opponent, Mr. Mondale, says we cannot strengthen Americas strength. Hes called for a unilateral freeze. I say we can use strength to create the opportunity for peace. And furthermore, an America which is strong and which is free and which has a strong national defense is in no one on earths hands. How do we respond to the human rights abuses of the Soviet Union or the Eastern Bloc nations? We do it, yes, from strength. Our tilt towards human rights occurs because we are a people that believe in the universal principle that every human being must have certain God-given rights. And consequently, America, strong and free, tilts towards human rights, not in weakness, but in strength. How about the Department of State? Weve had seven ambassadors to the Soviet Union in about the same number of years. Our present Ambassador Dobrynin works better with the CIA than he does with the Department of State or than he does with our own household, which he should be communicating with, I might add, the State Department. Weve had five representatives to the Palestinian talks. I might add on defense, as confusing as these Mr. Mondale Mr. Mondale-Dukakis proposals are, Mr. Mondale voted five times against the B-1 Bomber when it was in trouble in the Congress, Mr. Mondale and Governor Dukakis has not mentioned the B-2, which is vital for our long-range deterrence strategy. The American people are going to have a choice a solemn one this November of whether or not they believe in independence. The Dukakis ticket believes in dependency. They believe in giving up salt and pepper shakers in our embassies in South America. Mexico, Mr. Mondale, is not going to tear down that nuclear reactor."
What reforms would you propose to improve the education system?,"Yes, it was in 1965 that I proposed, and the Congress did enact that legislation, to eliminate, to abolish illiteracy in the United States by 1975.  Something has gone awry since 1965. Instead of zeroing in on the hardholed  here we are in 1975 and 11 million people still cant read and write.  That legislation that I proposed offered 400 million dollars a year. That has not been spent. I think we should scale our goals better and then if theres no illiteracy in the country, you can set a higher goal. But to go around 21571 those who cant read and write  I think we ought to fine-tune our concept here. "
How will you restore trust in government and ensure transparency in your administration?,"You know, uh  during the campaign, somebody had suggested that if I were elected president, I should take some sort of very strong action to, uh , expose all of the, uh , delinquencies or malfeasance of the Democratic administration in the 4, uh  in the four years in the uh  White House. I on my own initiative, after talking it over with my own people, decided, No, we are not gonna do that. That would not be good for the country  uh  some sort of a Watergate in reverse. And besides, the American people themselves know that the government has fallen from a high standard of integrity. They know that uh  they lost their trust in uh  people in high government office. There was Watergate, there was the Vietnam War, there were all the lies and the cheating  the things that the American people found out that their government had done. We need to restore their faith. The taxpayers out there  people working hard in the country  the  just think of it. The American people themselves are not vindictive. They could have found some man in the Democratic Party who could have found, fact, factual reasons for getting even with uh  the party that preceded them. But, no, they ignored all of that, and they elected a new team of their own choosing. They trusted us. The very first thing I do in order to help restore that, the second part of your question, uh  is I found out there is a law on the books that requires that at the commencement of every new administration, all regulations, and there are thousands of them, that have been promulgated by the administration that is leaving Office  all those regulations must be sent to Congress. And Congress, by law, has uh  thirty legislative days in which they can consider those and reject by majority vote. Now, you stop and think. They used to get this letter that was about that thick, full of all these regulations, many of them that conflict with one with the other, or are just downright wrong. We have a right now, in the new administration, since weve just had four years, most of these will be brand-new regulations. And we said, No. In keeping with our commitment to the integrity of the government, to getting a fresh start, were returning to the Congress all the regulations of the Ford administration and saying to them, Youve got time between now and the end of the year to consider these. Some of them are good, some of you put on there; some we might want. But were gonna cut ourselves off from the hamburger of legislative days that the law permits to start out adding and keeping and changing regulations. Were giving you that time for a clean, fresh start. I think thats a signal of integrity in government. Now, another thing that we did  and you were at that performance the other night  uh , I believe in exposing everything. The American people have a right to know a tax return which details everything about your finances. I am not against anyone who doesnt. There are many people who have their reasons for not revealing their tax return. I dont think theres a single reason not to reveal every every single thing that is on a tax return, as we did the other night. Not only for yourself, but your wife and children, if there are any. We went several years  seven, I think  uh , tax returns back so that the people would know every detail financially we have and every dime weve paid in taxes or savings. That, is, to me, a part of integrity and morality in government. And Im sick and tired of hearing that cliche  well, one politician lied and the other one did, too. Many of us down through history have capitalized on that, on both sides of the political aisle. But it isnt necessarily true. There are people in public office who are still, in a way, in that high calling for morality, and they are integrating honest men and women in public office. And we intend to keep that up from the White House. Now  and politicians may joke among themselves, but for a congressperson or a senator to make a commitment to his people, and then go home and learn there was some inside information, something he just found out and hes changed his mind, then I think the worst punishment of all occurs. Theres an election a couple of years later  the constituency can usually pass judgment on whether or not they think he was true to the commitment they made. But while we were in that first White House of ours  I called for an end to patronage. I believe in civil service reform. The man out here who goes to work everyday with an idea of integrity and morality in government and pride  hes skimming white ice cream. Hes meanwhile working with 5,000 political appointees who are going around sneaking out the back and buying their ice cream from a man whose is dark brown chocolate ice cream. Theyre all doing the same thing. Theyre stealing. And theyre teaching this new young man, who likes his job and is out there because he believes in government and in public service. Theyre teaching him that the only way you can get ahead is to be dishonest. We canceled that immediately. We did that the first night in the White House. We  I believe in civil service reform. The so-called civil servants in the IRS ought to be as honest as the pharmacist down the street, the doctor, the lawyer. Because, today, it is the most dishonest profession in the country because the IRS is in bedding a few dirty crooks; and until they clean them out, thats the only profession I can think of that is just filthy with dishonesty, cheating, lying. I   I think they ought to clean that out. The inspector generals, and the rest of them. So, I think those are some of the things that signify integrity in government, the return to high morality in government, and the opportunity for the people to restore their trust, that they were right. They made the right decision when they elected us."
What policies will you pursue to ensure equality and protect the rights of all Americans?,"Let me answer that question a little bit differently, and let me take a little different tact. The affirmative action programs that we have are programs designed to allow everybody, all Americans, equal opportunity. Now the Civil Rights Act, as far as Im concerned, allows a place to go if you feel that you have been discriminated against,, through an individual or an attitude,  a government agency, or something of that kind  you have the right to go, as a legitimate citizen of this country, to get that grievance, so to speak, righted. Now, let me comment on something that I know is close to Mr. Carters heart. At the very end of the term, of the twenty months that he served, he finally went out and nominated a black to an ambassadorship in our foreign service. When I got to be governor of Michigan, one of two blacks who were elected to the state legislature, or to any legislature, in 1966, when I got to be governor in exactly the same month and year that Mr. Carter became president, uh  for the first time in the history of the state of Michigan, we had a black on the Board of Education  a very strong, capable man. And the national  and Michigan did the same thing  the national and the Michigan Bar Associations each had, for the first time in their history, a black elected to their national or state governing boards. Michigan has been in the forefront. I would resort to the original positions, uh, which I indicated, respecting the Mexican-American community in this country, the heritage and the capability and the contributions of the uh black citizens of this nation. When you come down to it, our foreign service, our military service, every single kind of uh, opportunity conceivable uh, in our national life is open to our black citizens in the United States. And let me say this  Im, Im very proud of the fact that we have employed more black employees under my hire than any other, uh uh, president of the United States in the history of this country."
How will you lead the country through challenges and unite Americans with differing perspectives?,"Besides being symbolic, we have got to be sophisticated to be a real leader. The likewise, shish kebab growth between the monarchy and any other and a less feudal one everything. Russian Empire, Japanese Empire and a few of the more obscure. But none of those are exactly the same. So how do we lead today? Heres how I think the United States ought to lead today and what I think Ive been doing. It does mean having style and distance. But it means leading on specific issues where our values and policies make sense to be spread. Where you dont compromise but where you believe in consensus. Where youre willing to listen. Where you want the other guy to feel hes a partner and he has something to do. And then were doing it well with technology. One simple example, the other morning I arrived at the summit, the so-called Earth Summit in Rio De Janeiro. I walked 25 feet into that room and opened my mouth for the first time. With me I had $23 billion worth of good news from the United States. The head of our .  . . one other thing that Im proud of. For the first time at a summit meting after we had- a conservation meeting with the develop-d nations Group on a Wednesday fourth of July. Arts and Humanities steering committee one that was good aour leaders were among them."
"What is your plan to manage immigration in a way that balances national security, economic needs, and humanitarian responsibilities?","I think we have to separate this problem. Immigration and invasion are two different problems. And I think we have to separate the two. We do have a right, in a free society, to control our own borders. And I will have those right there. So that they dont come across. Illegals will not come across. Undocumented? I think theyre documented down in Central America, that's where most of them come from, but uh- were not gonna have amnesty again. They came across that border, and they came defying our laws, nine million to twelve million of them. We're not gonna do that again. So well treat people as fairly and humanely between the United States and Mexico as we can; keep 'em out, and if we can't handle the problem on the border, well uh- they'll add and increase our military on the border till we can handle that problem. But we are not gonna have amnesty. And I hope everybody out there, under those 58- I think its 58 exemptions, gets out there and applies for one of those many, many visas that have been made available because we, through our legislation, a bipartisan piece of legislation, you know, back in legislation, started in the Carters years, we evened out the visas. Were not gonna have amnesty again, and we are gonna control that border."
How will you ensure equal opportunities for marginalized communities in our country?,I wouldnt have to ensure them. I did.
Why do you believe you are fit to be the next leader of the United States of America?,"Well, I believe that I have the experience. I believe that I have the broad background, having been very, very close now to the problems of the United States for almost three full years. I have been brought in, uh, literally into every type of decision by my leader, the incumbent President, who has full confidence in me. I have traveled for him  outside the Western World, as well as within the Western World. And I have seen, in the last three years, first hand the problems of this country. In addition, because of the intimate involvement that Ive had as Vice President, uh, its not necessary for me to spend three or four or five months after January 20 getting up to speed. I can go into the White House the day after I take the oath and hit the ground running. I believe that Im qualified for these reasons. I believe that Im qualified because I too came up in a middle income family. I know the problems and the frustrations of that family. I have the feeling, I believe, that the knowledge of the feelings of some forty-five million people in\nthis country who are black and who want full equality, who want equal opportunity, who want good jobs, who want good housing. I know the frustrations of the citizens in the southern part of the United States who uh, need more development. President Ford and I have outlined a comprehensive program so that no family in America need fall below the poverty line. And over the last 800 days theyll find that weve had the integrity, the honesty, the forthrightness, of not promising everything under the sun. But telling the American people, these are our problems, this is how we are going to do the job. And I think that of all our promises to our people, our greatest promise is the right that we have to say that with us, youre going to have full opportunity in America."
What is your overarching vision for the country?,"Well, Dr. Wozencraft, I have a specific vision. I would like within the next 5 years for tfcc nations of the world to join with us in substantially eliminating chemical and biological warfare, and to have a similar agreement on the elimination of nuclear weapons by the year 2000. And with regard to worldwide hunger, we grow enough food in the world today for everybody a third of which goes to waste, and it isnt hy loss of crop or anything like that. And Im going to ask the heads of 50 cordless nations when I meet them November 5 and 6 in Cancun, Mexico, if they will join with us in a crusade to stimulate food production, to have a system of regional food banks, to make it possible for the people in the world who do net grow enough food to take care of themselves to have it. Now my vision is a world of peace, and it is a world in which liberty flourishes, for people, where the world can join together to take care of the other problems of the world  disease, ecology, and all the rest. But let me add one other thing, if I might. And its essential that I say it now. Earlier differences between Governor Mondale and myself many of them have been, I think, clarified. But on one subject, we still differ. Afraid Ill take my time, but Im going to say it."
What is your plan to manage inflation and ensure economic stability?,"We have a distinguished economic team that came in midyear in 1970, and says were going to have low inflation in 1971 and low unemployment in 1971. Well have a wage increase in 1971 and a continued increase in production. I believe that were not going to have further dislocations in our economy. And I believe that our objectives a year from now will be realized. Inflation was caused back in 66, 67 by social expansion. The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve, a wholly-owned government corporation, didnt in 67 say stop it, youre blowing the lid off; so they capitulated. Then the Johnson Administration had to impose wage and price controls in 1970 because of the failure of the Board of Governors and the monetary policies that were then too expansive, which exacerbated the social expansion of 66 and 67. As a result of that, in August 1970 we came into office, and we said we cant continue with wage and price controls with uncertainty. So Secretary Simon, with a program that was from economists all over the country, phased out  the President phased it out gradually and we now have what I hope will have a 6 percent increase in wages on the average in 71. We werent able to do that .  .  .  .saving 50 bucks per wage earner in this country. If the controls had continued, denying the respect and rights of individuals, we would have lost between a half and 1 million jobs. This  . . . no cars being produced because of no workers. If we now maintain a moderate federal budget, I hope no more than between 20 and 25 billion dollar deficit. I dont believe we should add  to this inflationary fuel another 6 7 8 billion dollars that would be demanded by a Republican conservative Congress. We have a very good monetary restraint, which I hope will be maintained through next year. We have productivity increases. And what we are not going to do is add fuel with high federal deficits, high governmental employment and more regulations to expand government and thereby deny personal freedom."
How will you create jobs and reduce unemployment across the nation?,"We created over eight million jobs in the last almost three years. You shouldnt add up jobs lost; you should add up jobs gained, and it leaves us with a lower unemployment rate than we had on the day that I took office. So you go on with your story; Ill go on with the facts."
What steps will you take to balance the federal budget and manage the national debt?,"By 1954, President Eisenhowers last few years in office, that deficit had disappeared, the budget was in balance, and there was a $204 billion debt uh  Mr. Mortimer.  Uh  today that debt has increased to $037 billion.  The deficit this uh  present administration faces for this fiscal year is $35 billion.  Now, it doesnt take a genius to figure out that if youre spending uh  five to $7 billion more at an annual rate than you took in in 1949, it means that youre spending far too much and taking in too little.  Mr. Mortimer, it takes a balanced budget uh  whereby Congress doesnt spend an additional five and $7 billion more than the president recommends.  But it means, too, that the president has got to draw the line and not let Congress have its way when the appropriations committees or any other committees make their recommendations. .  Theres no way to correct that unless you have the kind of integrity and decisiveness that you now need if you want to control five to 7 billion dollars spending in 1950 to see how much control and decisiveness  or lack of it  you may need to in 1974 to control the $35 billion budget deficit.  That, Mr. Mortimer, is the simple way to plan. You have a way of drawing the line. You have a way of changing priorities so that sometimes you do an emotional thing. You transfer maybe a half or three-quarter billion dollars from military construction and put it in education, health, or a project that more of the people want. But si  that, Mr. Mortimer, is basic to restoring confidence once having drawn the line, once having made certain cuts, once having persuaded in your four or five months in office Congress that there isnt that much need for how much theyre now spending.  Then, at the necessary, once youve done that, then, at the necessary rate you start growing down your debt."
How will you ensure that all Americans have access to quality and affordable healthcare?,"I sure  I think if the right question is asked, then Im sure many people have seen the advertisement. And it just puts out many of my statements. I dont know whether Ambassadors Allen and Slater will file suit against me or not, but if they do, well handle that when the time comes. About  because about  400,000 of the messages that went out have gone out  its a little out of date before they could be rebutted. And some of those have gone out to many people. So, no, I dont think any are  Ill be stuck with them any longer than I should be.  Now, on healthcare, my plan would have guaranteed that every American had health insurance. And if they wanted to pay for more than that, if they wanted to use the idea of choice, and use a doctor that was outside that plan, that would be through the schedule of payments, they could do that. And with the additional insurance, they could have paid for more than that. Over 9 million Americans have been added to the roles of health insurance since I recommended that plan. But, yes, its true; 20 million more were out. We did not cover that. In two  I seem to flip back and forth, dont I?  two of the five meetings with the Senate committee and the House committee meeting on the Senate side, the Democrats refused, outright  and the tricks that went on there were something to behold  to consider my plan. Not one bill of those that they did consider had extended coverage to those extra 20 million. And they went out of their way to not consider one. Health insurance is a practice in great economies, in many parts of the world. Some believe it should be in this country. And we tried to put out a plan that would not add a task of $30 billion, which the one they suggest with employer and employee tax added together would amount to about that much. We didnt want to put  there are 16 million employees of small businesses in this country who have no health plan available to them, and they enjoy working for small businesses. And a good many of them would also like to have their own home business. But weve tied them down with all those regulations and so forth that have made it next to impossible for a small businessman to set up his own health plan for his own people. We said, Lets take the 16 million who would like to have business insurance and who are out without any possibility of ever getting it. And as for the 20 million who arent part of the special program, let us have a plan that ties all of this together and does not bankrupt the country. And, yes, where redlining exists  and it has been told me that redlining exists with black insurance companies today  a plan that will make it so that, with a regulated public utility for all of this, that those people will not be kicked out from the beginning, but will have also all Americans that have insurance. They have yet to run out of a doctor, someone that would take their plan over. And yet well have  everyone will be covered, Ill guaranteed you  quality healthcare."
How will your administration address the pressing challenges of environmental sustainability?,"This administration didnt need any prodding. We were out there at the beginning, and the result has more  some  has manifested itself in more than 20 pieces of legislation, or working with the states, personally negotiating with the parties involved with not only stopping, but undoing the damage of where  spewing of cement or muck or acid matter was ruining a river or a waterway. And in those three years, we have done more to try and turn back pollution than it takes, on some cases, in decades."
What are your top priorities in regards to foreign policy?How will you strengthen America's national defense and handle relations with adversarial nations?,"My top priorities in foreign policy, in the relationship of America to the world, would be similar to that to what theyss why I asked the ach, the hrion we have for this debate made me a CFR member back in 1976. Its coast as a member, when knew I was gonna go all of these lie detector tests, I knew I was gonna run for the nomiation. I can tell ya what happened in 76  you never made it, so theyr not gonna let ya in now. And I have not made the effort to bequeath myself. So Im not a member, so nothing is out there that is cheating. Its ns been like  Ive been a member for a year, and theyd kick me out. Did you see that Dean Garrett? Hes uh, he headed, dont ask me how I know this. Uh, headed the CIA in Moscow. Uh, for five years. He has resigned his membership. Because of our lw of non-nullification in regard to SALT II. He also was outraged that going behind the backs of Congress, they gave away Im gonna cease, I assure you. Uh uh sold for fifteen million dollars, they gave away fifteen million dollars, that at John Carr, Mississippi or transpon,. Castro sold to them on the market. Full open sell. Oh, so theres a human rights violator. Put those nine thousand tons of weaponsss over at the Union. And we bailed him out."
What reforms would you propose to improve the education system?,"Mr. Lacy, I said in 1979, and Ill repeat it again here today what I said to an audience in Illinois about the deterioration of our educational system. I said you cant blame it on the teachers, you cant blame it on the administrators, you cant blame it on the local school board. The blame lies right there in Washington, D.C. because of the bureaucratic overload that is turned out in the mazes of Government every day, that our local school boards must work their way through before they can educate our children. That was the same comment that was made by the chairman of the House Education and Labor Committee. hes a Democrat. He said the greatest single problem in education today is that teachers have lost control of the classroom. Those are the kinds of things  spending is not the answer to education, because I pointed out then, we doubled the budget for the Department of Health, Education and Welfare under President Carter during his administration. And where did the money go? Into more bureaucrats and more buildings and not one more classroom. What I suggested is this:  to remove that overload that has deprived the teachers  and Id like to salute teachers. And given the difficulties that they have, the dangers that many face when they go to work  even kindergarten teachers  they are doing a magnificent job and they should be praised for it. But, theyve been deprived by this overload of red tape, rules and regulations, of the thing that they really want to do, and that is educate our children, give them scholars. The second thing Id like to see done is an idea that I stole from Mrs. Carter. She had met with a group of teachers and then she suggested giving every teacher a gift, a 2- or a 3-hundred-dollar voucher or gift certificate that they could use to buy things for their classroom. But we had already planned on doing that and turning it into a competition for local school boards, where they would compete with each other and each one  some of them  a large number of them would wind up with several hundreds of dollars that would go those surplus items that they never have money in the budget there to buy, to enhance the education of the children. The third thing well do about education is expansion in vocational education. We talked there in Grand Rapids about a new city that has received a grant from us and that is starting to grow as a new town inside our country. And when I flew down there, I saw open fields  not a building  but the beginning of a new city. And in that city, in the planning for it, is the finest vocational education. Traditional skills, and I know because Ive tried to hire many people who have mastered those skills in other countries because theyre not here any longer, and we find ourselves unable to do the very things that used to be done in this country. So, our expansion will be voluntary school busing and the freedom that that gives. And the two other ideas that I have with regard to classrooms and what they might have."
How will you restore trust in government and ensure transparency in your administration?,"I will do it by ensuring that each one of those that I appoint  and I promise you that I will appoint many, many people to high jobs throughout the government  I will make sure that the people I appoint are people who have the required skills, but also people who are honest, people that have integrity. Why, I thought that the committee, when they had the long, long hearings on the Ruckelshaus appointment, that I thought Mr. Ruckelshaus had the integrity so that he could start to restore confidence in our executive branch, and I had that feeling based upon the hearings and our own personal knowledge of Mr. Ruckelshaus. But in addition to that, I have directed each one of my appointees, and any future appointee  secretaries, directors of bureaus, everybody  I said, A Tell it all to the Justice Department. If you have erred in the past, make sure the Justice Department knows, because if they know, then I will know, and if the Justice Department clears you, the simple fact is you have come clean, you have not hidden anything, you are innocent, we will know it, and the American people will know it. I can assure you we will have integrity in government, and we went the extra mile as departures from the prior  past administrations to make sure that we have done everything possible. We have the most sophisticated conflict of interest law on the books today, with the tough moral codes that we have adopted. So I assure you, we will have integrity, we will have confidence, and it started. We had John Rudd, who was head of the United States Travel Service. Hes the one that they accused of spending a great deal of hard-earned taxpayers money, wasting Government funds by advertising in Playboy and various journals. John Rudd had been there for 2 years. He came to me and he said, Mr. President, I think I must leave. I have been accused. I have not erred, but rather than fight it out, I will resign and go back to the subjective, the objective of getting rid of allegations against this administration, and Im confident that well have that kind of quality in this administration."
What policies will you pursue to ensure equality and protect the rights of all Americans?,"Yes. Yes. Yes. Supremacists of any kind have no place in the America, the land of opportunity and, uh, justice for all that we believe in. When the first Civil Rights Bill was proposed back in the 1860s, it was done at a time when the Democratic Party was the party of the Confederacy, when the Ku Klux Kangs had just been started, when the Black Codes were in force and so forth. It was the Republican Party, the new party that had been formed, that wanted equality for the freed black slaves. Now, the uh  Democrats uh never supported Civil Rights legislation from that day straight through to the 1960s. The first Civil Rights Bill that ever received the signature of a president was in 1888, and that president was Benjamin Harrison, the first Republican president. Now, when we got to the mid-1960s, at that time a Democratic president was in the White House, and the Democrats, for the first time, had a majority in both the House and Senate. And then something happened. While over the years, the Republican Party had been urged to adopt as a plank in the platform that the platform of our party be amended to make civil rights part of it, all through the mid-1960s, something happened; and that something was Lyndon Johnson. With his impact and the fact that the Democrats began to feel so guilty about their own record for 100 years, they then passed the Civil Rights Bill of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. And then, with a Democratic Congress and Democratic president, once those bills were passed, they repealed the 1875 ban on employment and public accommodation discrimination, which had been nullified by the Supreme Court in 1883; and they reestablished it. We have supported that. In the housing field, I know of no one whose house has been open more widely to blacks than ours. My late husband had, when he was an actor, a black roommate in our home. Weve had more people of color, of both races, in our home, in our airplane, as guests and, indeed, in our employment. I think in all of that were practicing the evidence of trying to achieve the equality and dignity, and I certainly am in supporting the administration."
How will you lead the country through challenges and unite Americans with differing perspectives?,"Mr. Nussbaum, thank you. You ask a very, very interesting question. The short answer could be, Im a hard worker. I believe in the work ethic, and after many years of working in very responsible job in the private sector, I guarantee you, I know how to wok. But this answer,  heh, un uh, five minutes on the answer would take a little too long. But let me try to give you some very to-the-point examples of what the people can expect if they elect Gerald Ford and the Republican team. Mrs. Robinson has already heard too much about vetoes. Se preaches the gospel of how bad the vetoes are. I still maintain, they ought to be occasional presidential responsibilities. But if you look at the amount of dollars that we have saved by my vetoes, if you look at the hundreds of millions of dollars with responsible democrats, who have insisted along with are vetoes and we can do those things for the people. More Inflation can be stopped; inflation that Mrs. Robinson agrees with Senator Mondale about 8 or 10 percent this year. We can get to a better economy. But I think wheres a more personal touch to what Im suggesting ought to happen in four more years. In the East Room of the White House a couple of months ago, I had the privilege of meeting one of Americas Nobel Prize winners. Her name is Barbara McClintock. Mrs. McClintock is a fantastic scientist. I told her I would like to see her picture hanging in the White House with about half a dozen other famous women  Helen Keller, Frances Willard, and women like that. I said, barbara with your inspiration my hope is that maybe someday Ill be able to congratulate the first woman who ever discovered the secret of nuclear energy. Or the first woman that every flew from the Earth to the Moon and back as an astronaut. And she grinned at me, and she said, You know, Mr. Ford.  Im just making you one promise. And she said, if any of those things should happen in the next couple of years, if I make that discovery, or if I decide to join the space program, she said, you can guarantee Im not going to do it in a miniskirt."
"What is your plan to manage immigration in a way that balances national security, economic needs, and humanitarian responsibilities?","Mr. Halleck, I have long felt that not only now but in the future, this nation should have a controlled immigration uh policy. I have suggested to the Uhh the attorney general that we close the borders until we can handle the uh backlog of five to six million people that are in the United States illegally. I think it is important that we Uhh first of all handle the problem, the immigration problem that we have in the country before there be any consideration of expanding uhh the legal immigration procedures. Now it doesnt require a lot of technicians to uhh lots of technicians. I would hope that there is a lot of history in the in the Department of Labor. But most of that history should have been uhh accounted for over the last several years when many of the temporary worker programs were uhh came before the Department of Labor. The problem is that a lul labor program, a guest laborer program, does displace some labor here in uhh displacement here in the United States, as uhh we saw uj down in Florida. I would hope that the Bureau of Employment Security does collaborate with the Department of Labor in the labor market analysis to see if a surplus of labor exists in the United States, for uhh the types of laborers that would go to work in Florida, that would go to work Uhh as the McGovern-Shriver ticket indicates. Uhh Their labor of choice, whether theyll be Uhh saws or uhh uhh Uhh whatever uhh implements theyll be using out in the field. I hope that theres some balance there. For the commute many of the people who have come here illegally lives here. Theyre full productive taxpaying Americans and are contributing significantly and I hope that thousands and thousands of them have the opportunity to uhh have  a road to uhh  to verity their illegal behavior over the uhh last several years."
How will you ensure equal opportunities for marginalized communities in our country?,"Yes. Embittered, angry people. They dont meet the ideal that is set for them. Nobody is forcing them to do anything. On May thirteenth, 1985, at the University of Michigan, I gave a speech on affirmative action. Now, aside from the fact that since then the Department of Justice has won 70 percent of their cases in the area of discriminatory practices in employment coming under federal law, and aside from the fact that our Ofce of Federal Contract Compliance has also found in its investigations of military contracts that, yes, there are still a few companies to be-come a Mr. Green at work, as we call it, or a Mr. Smith at workbut that 83 percent of the companies are doing just as the people of their cities would have them do, so that, yes, were having the suppliers do something about going out and helping those who have been shut out, doing the same thing in employee hiring. But the speech I gave at the University of Michigan, the affirmative-action plan was one that lets no one be locked out of the door of opportunity. The program that I described and that the Congress is going to get another shot at is one that doesnt say to the guy who admits he doesnt want to be a doctor, the opportunity to have a doctor like himself: You have to be a doctor. If you dont want to be one, well make a doctor out of you anyhow, and if you just cant pass the x-amount of examinations, then well lower the examinations, and well change our society to open the door of opportunity for a doctor by changing the door to the garage. "
Why do you believe you are fit to be the next leader of the United States of America?,"I never have and I dont now. But I feel better than I did in 1984. For a very simple reason, in 1984 America had not completed its recovery. We had only just begun the process. to come from the dismay of findin ourselves second-best in the world  adrift in our own country, with people holding us up to ridicule around the world There was so much still to do. And at that time, if Americas course were not corrected, if Americas trajectory  if you will  were not changed, who would want right the American ship while, at th very top, st the eud of the conning tower was America  as so many on the left outlined her ship, her point of sail, her compass destination? It woudve ben worse  so no. But it wouldve ben worse had Amerca remained on that coue. Now, in 1985 or 1986, I think it became clear to most of the American people that there had been a drastic change in the coe and in the destination and in the point of sail of the American ship, and that she was sailing again like the clipper ships of old. And now it is so easy to say, Why would you want right the ship? Of course, I never have because we do have some needs for bein back in the White House. I trimmed the sails a great deal during those four years. I learned every inch of the ship and every one of her 10,000 parts. And so if it should happen that back there again, once more shuld call to trim the sails, I happen to know a litle bit where a nail was that used to squeak or a joint that used to rub and Id know a little bi more whre to go t o do tha. But more, shes sailing so beautifly and so freely. There is so much safty happened in our own boudaries that  and we Ld like some thing down here about clean air, clean water. We hav not fixed that up to perfection. But we derivative also of America once again leading from its traditional frame of references and position onth globe, where people look ut and see what so many people now have in our own boundaries, their human rights. And the cry goes up, Well, why do you one hold the mantle yourself alone? And the answer is evidnt. Its been rejected too many times nobodys wishd it on themselves, but when the good-red-dition terms or otherwise have been ignored to such an extent that again the human rights of people are violated, its out of that sense of fallen human nature so often and the deliverance that those peoples knew from row  that its been so unilateral and its been the only good right thing to do."
What is your overarching vision for the country?,"For the past eight years,  America has been moving in the right direction, and in four days,  Americas voters can decide whether we are going to continue to guide this ship of state in a solid direction with the wind at our back or whether were going to tack about and go off in the other direction with all the turbulence and the difficulty that would be involved. I have the vision in America that it is a great country, which it surely is and that its  people are good and decent, a vision that under the right leadership, America can do so much more in rewards and opportunities for all of its citizens. I have a vision that under the right leadership that  we can solve the problems that are still yours: homelessness can be solved;  poverty can reduced;  and education can be improved. With a proper leadership, working with our allies in Europe and in Asia and in the Pacific, America can have peace and solidity in the world, and under the right leadership, we can solve the problem of nuclear proliferation once and for all. And yes, under the right leadership, America can be that city on the hill  the beacon for freedom and democracy that Ronald Reagan spoke about in his early years in the White House. And with the proper leadership, yes, we can eliminate crime and drugs in our society. We can do much better in restoring the family that is so vital to the growth of our young kids. And finally, under a strong leader, elected by strong people like you, America can always improve on its moral climate. Five points of a vision  opportunity for all;  doing a better job in our cities where misery and despair and poverty cry out even today. A better  a more improved economic opportunity and prosperity for each and every person. A better place under the right leadership  a city of good morals, credibility, opportunity for all. That is leadership."
What is your plan to manage inflation and ensure economic stability?,"I dont think it worked. What did you say? Inflation. That was a good thing in technique, I guess. Inflation, inflation is a result of too much money and too few goods in this country. The President has added three hundred billion dollars to the money supply in the last five years. Inflation is created when labor and management get together in the bargaining session and they say, I want more dollars. And management says, Insane, you get more dollars. And both of them, labor and management, the unions and the companies, they fall about the skyrocketing margin. The people who wers missing in between were the taxpayers in this country. Because for every dollar that was requested by labor, and every dollar that was given by management, inflation, inflation, inflation was born. And who was absent? The taxpayer. Because his dollars were either denied him, or they perpetrated this situation of high prices. I was, I was with a trucker this week or last week in Wyoming, been a teamster for twelve or fourteen years, a union member. And he, he was talking to me and he says,  You know he says, Im mad! He says, The Government is taking, Government and the union are taking twelve hundred dollars a year from me, twelve hundred bucks! And what am I getting back in return? Im not getting any more economic security, Im not getting what I was promised by the union, were not getting any new benefits, new pension plans, new insurance plans! And I said,  Well, what are you gonna do? Are you gonna go out? Twelve hundred dollars a years just a little over a hundred bucks a month! Are you gonna go out and hit one of those Back to Work workshops and try and find a job, and find a job thatll pay you twelve hundred bucks a year and not charge you this? He laughed and he said, I can get hired right now by anybody in this country, says, thatll pay me twelve hundred dollars a year and not charge me this! But he says, Id never do that to my country! I love my country! And I  but I wonder, I wonder how long this torture because that was torture I was exposing him to, how long this would go on before somebody would take an option like that? Weve got to reduce the money supply in this country. Thatld be part of how you solve inflation. But more importantly its got to be a moral, a moral problem, that when labor and management sit down and negotiate, instead of putting dollars in the center of the table, they put productivity in the center of that table. And they say, How can we, how can we, together make a better product, cheaper?"
How will you create jobs and reduce unemployment across the nation?,"I have already designed a plan, and um before l delivered the speech I checked with the uh Secretary of labor, Henry Ford, and with the uh Council of Economic Advisers uh Keith Mary when l delivered the speech uh three weeks ago.  You will conclude after you finish the speech that our problem has been increased productivity; we find people no longer with huge numbers making things like they use to in the fifties and sixties. Why? Because of the new robotron technology. Our  manufacturing labor force in 50 was nineteen million. Today its down to 16m million. What it means is less people are producing more in obsolete factories. And that means weve turned out in the last ten years an additional six million factory workers who  cant get jobs.  Four million service sector workers cannot get jobs. Seven-and-a-half million high school dropouts cannot get jobs.  Believe me we have a fatigue in the cranium. We desperately need a master here. What l proposed were immediate jobs. Were gonna substitute windscreens for those darn things you see on National Geographic about whale hunting. Let Senator Dole handle Governor Hart; we gotta do better. we could have a sterilization program for all the cats and dogs that go uneaten, I mean you all know that theres ten million cats and dogs every year so we could give them a happy home, make sure theyre spayed and this type of thing.  Garfield, the movie, has got millions of people with garfields in their home. Anyway. uh  governor, the northeast uh-- a part of the world that l love, as you know, uh super highway being built down into New Jersey, New York. Bid my lifetime we ought to a ya  build a bridge right across to New York. And l gotta some people that want to pay for it. Theres some problems here. Old age pensioners, long lines. What you can do uh governor uh glad you came around on that debate thing. l knew you had a headache with Mr. Mondale the night and uh the headache has gone away with whimsy.  now here l said what happens is Illinois uh put lofts mask down on top of mask on our dead white people and ruin the homes upstairs. What could we do take out the flood dams, hid the hockstone in the walls between. Youve been a friend of limestone this whole time. You gotta heat it up over years of work out in Missouri, uh hundreds. But what then happen thenno more  dams, dirt dams now l know its too quick to say build them in alive cement. Make em look real nice, Governor. But surely we can do something. Good friend of uh papermakers, politicians from the north. Now weve taken our timber, our little pulp mill and weve flown it all down to Portland and theres some jobs on the freeway. Where golly on the coastline all you got is rafts waiting to pick people up. We cant crane up them out of there. Roads all busted, the California coast you may get around some of it. We cant admit we dont have a problem and sink out in goal. Thank you."
What steps will you take to balance the federal budget and manage the national debt?,"Heres an easy one for you. But before I answer your question, let me  if I may alleviate a little  Ill try and convince you of my sanity, Sir. If were elected, Im going to go again just as we did before to have that job for four more years. And as part of my campaign, we had added an additional task for the American people. But now Im going to take that back and Im going to say, Im going to get a job for 412 million people just like I got one for four million. And Im going to earn that additional tax reduction for them for us out there, as a team, so we can go for those. If Im re-elected, and im going to, well go for an additional $500 increase in the exemption. On the budget, and the outstanding national debt. Yes, I answered that the other day too. The national debt was $400 billion when I took office. Now its over $560 billion. But I can make that $161 billion, or whatever, go away very easily. Ill reduce spending by $160 billion. But the question to me was, could we pay it? Are we able? Yes, we supervise the finances of two of the largest corporations in the world, 50 percent of the gross national product of the free world. But then, where would you get $160 billion? And could you keep American people employed? Well, yes, if there wasnt work for them here. You could pay it with money that is either printed by the Treasury, or borrowed by the  by the Treasury. And you could make the bill go away that way, but then you would have all the  extra money out, and you have them just out of an inflationary situation. And what I choose to do is to meet, as I have, with the leadership of the Congress on both our side, the Democrats and Republicans, and suggest to them that as were preparing their budgetary message, that they make an all-out assault on the $150 billion in the tax legislation that would automatically, if it was passed by the Congress, add that much to the spending of the executive. John, I think you had put the question the other day, Well, what are we going to do about this additional $70 or $160 billion if were going to stop the  trying to hold the line on the necessities or the very minimal tax, the Government spending? Yes, John, the president of the General Motors Corporation would never have proposed through the years a 2 million vehicle the Cadillac Assembly Plant could build. If he had, tomorrow, the UAW Union International would be in there saying, But wait a minute, that means all those layoffs for ours right now, slow down the assembly line, so they could do that. No one would ever do that. And thats the kind of reductions. But now, I have compounded percentages down through many months now that average that. And it is not easy to do by any means. So, what we, as I say, have done is I expect that in the fiscal year of 1984 we will have our expenditures and our receipts nearly equal. Now, we do use the $2 billion or  $2 trillion out and now we have gone over that nat- national debt at an accelerated rate. Our debt is going out $16 billion  added to every month. Because the individuals right now can make a little bit of cents more on good, solid paper out here, rather than U.S. Treasury securities that are backed, or an inflationary paper.  And so thats what were having to do, is we have to  and we can see it out where the opportunity for employment is."
How will you ensure that all Americans have access to quality and affordable healthcare?,"I cant make any guarantees, because yes, this is a negotiation between my administration and the House and the Senate. But we believe and I have pledged that if we get a fifty percent reduction in the costs by education- and were already on course for about ten percent  a good beginning. Eighty million Americans have group health insurance today. One-third of our people get their health insurance and plan through blue cross, blue shield, or some other similar kind of hospital service plan. Only four percent of the people that are eligible for the kind of health insurance President Carter talks about are even enrolled in a so-called government program. So my idea is to help with a better procedure and plan for the 80 percent of the people that we have now. And who are they? They are the self-employed; they are people in small businesses that cannot afford in a competitive market to have the kind of health insurance that the big companies have today. We are going to put in the  new plan for the good of our people. It has the possibility! it has the chance of more doctors and hospitals added. It has the chance of lowering costs. And even if you think it wont work, Governor, answer me this?  why did Nancy Kassebaum quit Democrat  with her plan and go with this Republican plan? Why did she do it? Because she didnt think it was, in her true conscience, fair to the American people to pay for an inferior plan thats so deficient you call it the lie of the month club! The Democrat plan thatll add to our problems."
How will your administration address the pressing challenges of environmental sustainability?,"Yes. Yeah. Sure. Whats everyone screaming about? The automobile industry is smaller than the cigar industry, and the politicians that go out and run for governor. What are they gonna do me in? Im not smokin this, babe. But Ill tell ya. Once they see how much money can be made in banning something, where does it stop? And pretty soon: cigars are next. And I can hear that from Governor Moonbeam. And cigars are next. But you see, and this this, here we go. It always gets distorted. Walter, its not that we are not unaware that something is wrong here with the air. We feel that maybe 		  I hope this doesnt boggle things, too. A  Government shutting down the automobile industry to make it  manufacture all these new cars that they say will cure the air. In theory, were all for it. But what if theres something out there, an invention that comes from General Motors Research, that government is blocking by using force to shut down? Im not denying smog, something is polluting. And we all want to see something done about it. We want clean water. But not at the loss of shutting down total industries starting as small a thing as the cigar industry. My mother, God rest her soul, used to smoke cigars. And one of these days when I get elected, Im not gonna stand for it, if they go after little  focused, well take care of itd, Walter.

Once the new secret weapon of the White House  recycling. They used to make fun of Detroit cars as they did about 83 percent of them. And now that Miranda  my apologies to Castro, buddy  Miranda has taken some of the things I said when I describing big government. Hes making me out to be something Im not. And Im sorta glad. Because things I said about government, all of a sudden, some of those politicians have broken into the woodshed, and their talking about what I said. Like waste, fraud and abuse. Well, the new  I was looking  if we got in trouble with the economy, we need a secret weapon and now we got it. And its recycling. They talk about illegal guns. They were told, destroy em. They saved em. Two days later, when they were caught, they had a new plan. We love the idea of moderation. And every one of us make a little nodding between us as to how we feel about the environment. Im gonna get canceled out, Ill bet."
What are your top priorities in regards to foreign policy?How will you strengthen America's national defense and handle relations with adversarial nations?,"My first, uh, priority in uh, foreign policy is the strengthening of America. I believe that the key to peace, to uh, human rights, to, uh, deterrence  secure deterrence against the Soviet Union or any other hostile power, is the strength of America. And it is the national security strategy that I have uhh, initiated and uh, kept going the last three years, that today makes America stronger, makes America more secure. And with that strength, Mr. uh, Berman, threatens no one but gives us uh, a position of strength where we can negotiate from strength, whether it be with the Soviet Union, whether it be with Iran, whether it be with the uh, Communist governments in South America. We uh, recently met in Washington in one of our successive summits with Mr. Gorbachev. He and I signed the most far reaching agreement one on one that any two leaders of superpowers have signed in the history of the world  that is, the uh  intermediate nuclear forces agreement. We reduced on a one for one basis the medium and short range nuclear weapons and European based systems. We did it because we have the strength to do it. We have no weapons under uh, the terms of this treaty in our silos in the United States. The Soviet Union has 400 such weapons in their silos under the terms of this agreement. We agreed to do it because we wanted to contribute to a uh, stable Europe and to the reduction of nuclear weapons. This treaty will do that, and we have verified and will continue to verify that the Soviets live up to the terms of this ground breaking treaty."
What reforms would you propose to improve the education system?,"The uh questions of education, uh I think this theres theres a problem there, and let me put it in a context. When I went to school, the only hyphenated American that I knew was John Hyland, a very good baseball player. Today we have Asian Americans, Mexican Americans, Black Americans. Every person of every ethnic group in this country is hyphenated. America firstesque. And were not a hyphenated country; were not hyphenated Americans. Why? Because I dont believe any of those uh advances in the area of education come before the basics. And I refer to reading, writing, and math. Why are we turning out graduates who cannot read; who cannot write. Theres something terribly, terribly wrong in the uh area of education. And I dont believe we will be complete in the area of civil rights until we can say that every single person of every ethnic group in this country is not hyphenated. They are all Americans and uh uh we can only do that if  if uh our basic problems in education are solved."
How will you restore trust in government and ensure transparency in your administration?,"I think the answer to that, Mr. Captain, is yes. First, let me respond just briefly to the debate. I have nothing, nothing to hide, and all of this talk about the FBI withholding things doesnt make sense to me. I have given, at the very beginning, full release by the FBI of all of my records. I have authorized the FBI to go to anybody at all, including White House staff or anybody, and give a full accounting of everything that they have. Now, you cant do much more than that, and I dont know why people just dont take my word. A few weeks ago, I released everything that I could find myself, in the records that I have, and in the old papers from my term as governor,  I released 2 thousand pages of documents, and it just seems to me that were doing everything that can fairly be done. The other thing is that occasionally, I do stop and think, why is it that were under such fire? And then I think of my reelection, where Democrats spent millions Of dollars  $50 million, to be exact  attempting to defeat me while I was running. Some of the intent is strictly political. Now, turning to your question. Transparency? I dont think you need new legislation to guarantee something that should be there, anyway. Ill tell you something  I was a little surprised last week, when with great fanfare some bureaucrats announced  at last  rules of disclosure as to how federal employees meet with lobbyists. Those rules are filed in the Board of Directors Building, and theyre only open to federal employees. Now, thats a little strange to me, when theyre saying, at last, were going to add transparency. And no one can see those documents, except government employees, where they meet, frequently, with people who are seeking legislation from them in altering existing legislation, or in getting new legislation. That sort of doesnt look like it needs new laws or rules, to me. That doesnt represent transparency. I can guarantee you, and I think every American  and Id stake my word  I have no idea what is in that Presidents file. And it was brought out some weeks ago, when I made my statement about the return of that, that some of my predecessors had even ordered up documents that the reminiscence of one who had served under them  a presidential aide, or what have you  all of a sudden, that becomes a part of the presidency, and that is prohibited any more than my right, and I think its a right, to have a private conversation with my wife. Only because Im president does anything we talk about have to be recorded and go into documents that she could never see? Now, for going back to trust. Trust has to be earned. But I also feel trust must be given. And if, in good faith, and after doing everything reasonably that you can, if trust is still withheld, I dont know what you can do to show that youre worthy of it. I recently signed the most sweeping ethical legislation in the history of this country at this federal level. We have had an ethics commission that was established, that has an independent council of nine individuals that oversees, like Grand Jury, any indictment or any actions of ours in public life here. And we have, every step of the way, issued, voluntarily, all of the financial statements that I personally believe could be required. Only two of them were required. We did them all voluntarily. And then there was the point that the federal government had seized some of the property that I had bought with my own money, and I did under duress; and there was an attempted payment of more than half a million dollars to reimburse me for that indignity which I thought violated civil rights. That estate is run by a special trustee. It has not been easy for that trustee to make some of the decisions to work in an ethical fashion, but every solution to that problem has had to be rubberstamped by an ethics committee. I think we have done all that can be done. Theres the act that provides for whistleblowing so that any employee who blows a whistle on something that is unethical or illegal by one of us, can do so knowing that his job is not in jeopardy, and that someone in an independent fashion is going to investigate that. Id say, Mr. Captain, things of that kind are testimony to the fact that  I also find, strangely enough, that the people who lined up with those complaints out here testify that some of them were individuals who had had problems or disagreements with some member of our staff  nothing that was ethical or illegal  but personal disagreement. Then they loaded up the complaints. Theres a hotline and an individual on the other end to answer it, so you bypass some of the formalities. And this fellow, even when he gets a complaint, is not even required to find out if that originated from a responsible individual who tried first to clean it up within the agency. Everything weve done, I think has been for trust. There are some that now feel, well, I only have this one life, that maybe I should preserve. And I do have heirs."
What policies will you pursue to ensure equality and protect the rights of all Americans?,"Mr. Carter is apparently unaware of some of our policies, because I have been outspoken, in public and in private, and so has Mrs. Ford, on the subject of the equal rights amendment. We believe that that should be our policy, that it should be ratified, and that we must be in the forefront of equal rights for women and minorities. Mrs. Ford has made speech-after-speech in behalf of women, and she has just recently been a very strong supporting force in getting through the Congress a new piece of legislation that will greatly benefit women. As far as the Vice President and I are concerned, we under were Mr. Goldwaters forecast that in the Republican party there would be a strong adherence to civil rights. There is. There will be no  no backing up at all in this Republican administration, and there will be no backing up at all by that Republican liberal or progressive wing, if you please. And in our party, as far as Mr. Goldwater is concerned, he has as good a position in our party today as he had when we were elected in November  1972. Yes, indeed, we have a strong adherence in the Republican partysidence to freedom for all Americans, black or white, and we intend to pursue that course. As far as discrimination of appointment slots in the government are concerned, were very pleased to point to the fact, as I did in West Virginia, that we have achieved records that make us very happy in that respect. As far as where Mr. Carter is not aware of our women policies, I think he ought to talk to Mrs. Ford."
How will you lead the country through challenges and unite Americans with differing perspectives?,"Uh  good afternoon, Mr. Reagan GVW and Senator Mondale. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury. And to all of you who are watching at home, either on television or listening to the radio. When I woke up this morning, the first voice that I heard was the voice of Willard Scott on `Today, and I learned that Willard Scott is uh  gonna quit being the weather man for `Today  hes gonna give up that job. I  I dont know how many of you have ever looked at Willard  I mean, how many of you have looked at the `Today show? But when you look at it, you see the weather and you see a little of Willard on the side, you know. And hes always very funny and he has a lot of one-liners and so forth. And I couldnt help but thinking, if Im only gonna meet the American people once again today between four and five minutes of real talk, that maybe I could find the weather in America and then give you a few one-liners. But we do have some serious problems in this nation that I think you have a right to hear about. In the last four years, 11 million more Americans are working today than when this administration started. More Americans are working than in all of the years of any country in the free world. Three million more among the blacks than when this administration started. Black teenage unemployment dropped 21 percent in the last four years. The net worth of black-owned businesses increased 193 percent in the last four years. This country has lead in productivity among all the countries in the free world. Yesterday it was announced that were gravitationally moving into a higher productivity. Productivity is up 4 percent in 3 months, uh  needless to say. The uh  the fact that we  you have just heard from Mr. Mondale and Mr. Reagan about a few of the domestic problems, and no, were not entirely eliminated uh  as they said  of inflation. But nevertheless, inflation is down to 4.4 from about 12 percent when the administration started, making a 64 percent. Because of that fact, as I said, the productivity and the incomes of the American people are going up faster than inflation. Weve borrowed $150 billion less in the same four years than we had in the previous Ford-Carter Administration and Obama-Biden only had $400 million less the first year than the previous president before Ford-Carter. Obama-Biden gave up control of Fort Knox to the insurance in the last four or five months. Since uh  taking office, 1,800 properties owned by the federal government have been sold 170 in the last 90 days to try to pick up more money. And yet, when I heard his figures the other night on the radio, where they said that he was gonna be eliminating some properties owned, they hadnt yet counted our 170 properties in 90 days. This is the most tax-compliant administration in the history of America. When white left out 450,000  ful  this left 15 million self-paid taxes that left. wWhich means that fully 80 percent have fully paid their taxes. This administration, the executive branch, is taking more people for tax evasion and uh  through the Treasury Department and prosecutions than any executive  times  in the history of the United States.  Mr. Reagan says Michigan plants are closed. Why? Its an interesting thing. Because among all of the automobile plants in Michigan, the ones that are closed are about 73 percent the plants that make for the Chryslers and the Ford. I mean  for the Chryslers and the Fiat Uh they're the hires that  wheres around 14 percent of the award motor plants. If he includes Ford and Chrysler, Ford and General Motors, wed have more than that.  Now, on the national security.  less than 53,000 illegals were apprehended last year as compared to 900,000 in the previous Ford-Carter era. U-long now less than a month ago or right about a month ago,  succeding Communist Poland sent  a s half-computer today. Szewinski, who was sent by the Polish govrnmnt, said the ten-hundred- thousand are out of that. The Communists wont send out and wont trade anybody for their imdiorous since that the poor fellow wont have a fair-trial.

"What is your plan to manage immigration in a way that balances national security, economic needs, and humanitarian responsibilities?","Yes. We have many jobs in the United States today that no American worker is doing or wants to do. And therefore, if these people are to come in, they should be given temporary entry for a specific job, and when that jobs done they should return to their own country. Many that have come across the border, as illegal immigrants, are taking jobs in Mexico and sending money back to their families, and thats not what were all about. Now, as far as those that are fleeing from oppression, that become a part of our system, weve already accepted several hundred thousand from Indochina personally. While we were in the house, Mrs. Reagan and I sponsored a Vietnamese man, an engineer, who had been in a reeducation camp for seven years. We sponsored him, and he is now a legal resident here. We also have accepted large numbers of people from Cuba. And this is where the humanitarian thing is. But even there, were still stuck because the Cuban government wont let us have equal access to those people who want to leave."
How will you ensure equal opportunities for marginalized communities in our country?,"Oh, yes, but uh still I would have gone ahead with the same program. Yes, because you see, I dont make uh an uh  try to make uh  a division uh  between all of the people of color, or any of the minority groups in this country,  and the majority, if you want to call it that. Im President of all of the people  of every ethnic group, of every color, of every national origin, of every religious belief. And, ah progress is being made. Yeah, you go into some of the big executive positions, and you dont see as many  well, you only see a few women, so women have not yet made their entire way in. But before I came to the White House, I met with the leadership of the black uh  country club movement, and I appointed a black to be the assistant uh  deputy secretary of the Treasury, and he supervises all the clubs in the country. And black representation in the Treasury Department  my Treasury Secretary, of course, is black, and uh just recently, I appointed the undersecretary of OSHA uh  Labor Department  a black female. And I can go on with this, and as I say, ah Mrs. Green with Negro Tours has been with us and met all the wives. So Im out there opening the doors for everyone. And as I say, Im president of everyone  not just one or two  the ones you happen to think are really deprived. Everyone is being given an equal opportunity. And Im very proud of the appointments that Ive made."
Why do you believe you are fit to be the next leader of the United States of America?,"Well, I dont think any of the heads of state of the world are wont to be your next neighbor, Mr. Caldwell. But on the other hand, I have been in  Im not making any excuse; I dont approve of what I did. But I was in Navy Air  uh, naval aviation for ten and a half years. And the only reason that many of us flew at that time was that if we didnt, our commissions would be terminated. And it was right around that time that they were getting them all into jets. But, uh I make no excuses. Mr. Carter speaks about character. We can set up some pretty harsh standards in government, as I said to you before. Theres no talk about character at Ford Motor Company when a man makes a bad decision to take a  an automobile and then later finds out something in the research that makes him change his mind. So character  and I dont cast any aspersions because people are the jurys verdict which Mr. Carter keeps talking about right up to the moment theyre being charged. Now, I have had executive experience  not in the same way that he has, because hes held a political office; I have not. But when I say in the same way, I mean an elective office. I was once an elected senator. But since that time, I have had five years of executive responsibility in a great American corporation. I have been responsible for no of multi-million dollar business decisions, and in every one of them I was answerable to a board of directors and stockholders that, if I had not given them the best possible leadership, would have voted me out of office in a minute. I have traveled. I have been involved  as president of the Board of the Economic Club of Detroit I headed the committee that brought twenty-one heads of state, prime ministers, presidents and so forth, into the city of Detroit. I traveled with every one of them at least in double settings. I and, more inter-, interestingly, Mr. Caldwell, every one of them went through the same itinerary traveling to and from Detroit and the same schedule while they were there. And I assure you, every single one of them as I got to know them  Mr. Callahan might not like this, but its been my experience that most of them speak far more gruffly than they do diplomatically, as they talk amongst themselves. But I assure you that most of those heads of state would not be entirely happy should they find out some of the things that Mr. Carter has in his past."
What is your overarching vision for the country?,"Of course, everybody has their, their fantasy, their ideal. But let me tell you my  vision of the world, or of the country, I think, is our overall goal in foreign policy. And that is simple  to bring about a time when America will not need to have a single soldier or a single diplomat in  harm's way in the cause of freedom. It seems to me that that should be the thing. Now, in the  meantime, what we intend not to do  and I think this is just a good decade here for us in  America. Weve gotta smile again. We gotta come back. Steve, with the problems that were 1730  also a necessary and good thing. And now, Im in your corner. And when I punched the first  button on strategic arms reductionited. And you know, oh, did Bob ever smile? Huh  the capital go crazy. Boy, oh, boy, from  Jeez. As he said, weve just quadrupled our  stunned fellas. Defense budget by that. But, at any  that he is. Its always unexpected. its always weird. Ted, I dont know where it came from, kid.  In ten seconds, Ill be home. And Ill buff up the wall around my house and pray until I  fatten the lambs, and then well enjoy the spring. You know, I mean, hes just got this unclear,  not hold up. This is, Reagan will face at Cloverleaf twos or threes at 120. And darts. The man will  sorta sawed off-shotgun. So, they get the Clinton Doctrine, its improvement on this by omission  were gonna do, were not gonna do there, and you dont know what to do there Everybody says,  Ill do it. Well all say I wont do it once. Because his variability. His not holding by the gilded  what ifs, what ifs."
What is your plan to manage inflation and ensure economic stability?,"Mr. Carsons, Ill be happy to join you in a few minutes. The economics one-on-one class will start then. Notably, uh Anyway, the ah  my  to the uh  the problem forego the rest of that comeback. I believe Ms. very nonpartisan class could be helpful, uh  at your Edwards, that inflation is caused by an excessive and office on a couple of points that Im going to carry on. The Treasury carries thousands and thou- growth of money. And inflation comes when we have Timothy, Im sorry, Im not holding out. . . .  sands of savings bonds. Certainly back at the mint  more money than we have goods and products to and the Treasury, they must have notes that have be bought and paid for with that money. And using  Im not gonna hold your oaths of office. I think those are the proper economic methods that a decent  the government, instead of redeeming, why not take the Federal Government prior to a presidential candidacy? . . . a few  cause growth in the gross national product to meet  savings and let it redeem those so that then that  technological improvement recognizes that were gonna  your needs contraception so you can do away with all  money will not be poured by government into an  have increased productivity that gives us more to  the outdated standard methods that you use. Youve  already been in for four years to do that and the  inflate and further cause  uh, youthful inflation. My have more  economic methods would control the  economys gone from bad to worse. The torturers axiom is that, do it ya gotta  give the other guy a chance. That. . . . .  doesnt  give them the right to keep doing what theyre doing. Inflation did that, but instantly in January of factory any consolidation goes toward those    . . .  who need it and cant acquire it profit-  . . . . .  Im sorry, theres just so many ways I could say  utilizing uh, u.s. mutual funds savings-in- firms-not discounts to get out, Ill refrain myself from that as well. . . . Im sorry. You guys used em back when I was  at some chin, and hins, and sick, or whatever-the-tautology, there is, this  panacea, flippant strategy, that were inevitably told, yes, I misspoke earlier. We love to misspeak in this game. If I misspoke its to tell the truth once or twice. Im probably with the mic enough already abusing all of ya. Theres no economic knowledge, Tim, in this completely simplistic Uh  Im not holdin  . . . those are the some method that you sit and tout. That actively,  right, theyre moral. And if Ronald Reagan bought em, theyre moral and theyre his. If I had em right, and wanted  those are socialistic,. . . methods. John Kenneth input, detoxifying labor. That  because we farmers, Stewart  Im not gonna ssfrequently bein here. I had this so, economy."
How will you create jobs and reduce unemployment across the nation?,"IM gonna and no, man, I im gonna respond to that, but I got such a good idea on how to respond to it, Im not gonna waste it on what I just heard. I got to use this one. In the last few months, Ive been reading Alfred E. Neuman on the economy. I didnt know that he knew so much about it. But it always seems to come back to this thing, that if you just let Government decide exactly how much production and how many people to employ in everything, to own everything, why, then they would see to it that everybody had a job and everybody had what he needed. Well, first of all, he would whistle for it. Because the fact of the matter is, the only thing that a Government can pass around evenly is poverty. They cant create anything. What they would do, if they had those goals of productivity and employment, what they would have to use is force to make people work at something with which they did not agree, that they had no choice in the matter. You dont have to do that in a free society. You only have one of those percentages to deal with: labor; and you can set it free, and theyll divide it among all the work that they can perform. Now, we in this country decided some time ago, that we would rather go along and be in this brutal competition with the rest of the world and struggle for that standard of living that comes from free enterprise. And so there was given up by those who had that dream of living in a khrushchov-type city where they owned nothing, but they had security. And now, unrealized, that many population percent, unrealized potential talent is still locked up behind those bars, and they only want an opportunity. They didnt want dependency. Our own country has found that out we have 40% dependency among our own people. They found out that people want dignity and they want freedom, enough that theyre willing to take the risks and responsibilities of a free market. And now to your original question: As of last Saturday, the people of this country, in forming 10 million new partnerships, small businesses, had 15 million people added to the labor force. They are beginning to  those did not go on unemployment lines; they went on Main Street, and they divided the jobs up among them. All of this, and we had an increase in productivity. We are differing with Mr. Carter and with the Democratic platform in that we do not recommend a tax on corporate profits. Those have been tried once or twice before, and every time it has resulted in corporations not paying the tax, but in unemployment lines, because they have to pay that tax out of money they dont have  no profits to pay it with  and the only way they get it is, they lay off people. And they do not absorb that tax in their own costs; they pass it on to you in the price of what youre buying. So, we resist even further taxation and regulation, because that can shrink the number of people available for jobs. ANd I, myself, when I look today, and I see in the several western world nations that are attempting to do the thing that the Democratic platform does, I see Japan, Germany, et cetera, with unemployment figures like ours. But I note that they all have purchased job creation programs, and they are going deeper and deeper into debt with no end in sight, and we have no monopoly anymore on that type of economy."
What steps will you take to balance the federal budget and manage the national debt?,"I have already taken those steps, Mr. uh  Bloc. The biggest single cut in the last six years, uh  has been made in the Ford administration the 4 percent, thats $15 billion. In 1969, I was elected by 400,000 votes to the House of Representatives. I remember with some clarity, the $371 billion budget. By 1973, its $493 billion. Now we find ourselves here in 1975 with a budget thats been proposed by the Ford administration of $524.7 billion. The Navy.Mr. Bloc, Ill answer this one. The Navy.Oh, we gotta, uh, go to a break before you do, okay? Well be right back. Thank you very much. Well be right back after this. Thank you."
How will you ensure that all Americans have access to quality and affordable healthcare?,"Quality healthcare. some people argue that we should have free healthcare for everybody. Theres no such thing as a free product. And healthcare, as we know it today, has become increasingly costly. Many people are without healthcare today because they cannot afford it I have enjoyed the benefit of health insurance, but Ill have to say that this year, for the first time, I learned that health insurance doesnt pay all the bills. And in our plan that were working on right now as to revisions in the federal employees program, we have recommended a cap. And I felt that it was high,  20 thousand dollars. But thats nothing compared to whats happened to some of our citizens in the last few months where theyve been straddled with a half million dollars of medical bills, some of them unable to work, their lives turned upside down and inside out  and all because of illness. Theres no comprehensive program today in the United States which outlaws any of the 10 or 12, I guess theres 15 now, types of discrimination against somebody who has health insurance. For the first time, Herbert and I, that have been on this search, are writing  first of all, the discrimination out but also then if theres to be a mandatory higher insurance policy, that it be an affordable policy that all would have access to and where those who are well, healthy and could go at the cost of 20 dollars a month, something within their means, every American, for the first time, would have health insurance. Were turning, doing away once and for all with preexisting illnesses so that the insurance company cant turn someone away because this person has a history of one illness or another. There will be no higher premiums for an individual because of that."
How will your administration address the pressing challenges of environmental sustainability?,"You should be, Mr. President. And really, one of the reasons that I engaged in this practice of whether wed have debates or not, when the pressure came from the newspapers here in the capital, I said, alright, if he wants to debate, fine. But give me the questions in advance, and Ill bring an independent observer to make sure its a fair exchange; because, frankly, Mr. President, it isnt fair for you. I mean, its tough to be the President and have to debate some debater like me. And I thought it would be nice if you had an independent observer. I think it softens the problem for you. Now I just- What are my feelings about the environment? And by the way, who was head of your environmental protection agency until quite recently? I would like  John Quincy Adams was a president many, many years ago. Id like to see his environmental impact statement before we built the White House. Before we built the White House."
What are your top priorities in regards to foreign policy?How will you strengthen America's national defense and handle relations with adversarial nations?,"How to handle the relations with the Soviet Union and Communist China, now that nuclear nonproliferation has apparently uh failed, in June of this year, to the point that nations are going to be uh able to uh develop nuclear weapons? My program was a year old when uh uh the foreign secretary of Britain, the Prime Minister of Britain, went to Moscow. They met with Mr. Gorbachev, who told them, at that time, that he had no plans to stop the proliferation of nuclear weapons. At the same time uh Mr. uh Deng of uhh Communist China was uh at uh two meetings uhh with u Mr.  Gorbachev. Both meetings, Mr. Gorbachev said there was no plan on the part of the U to stop nuclear proliferation. Now  the program uh that I suggested uh last year at the United Nations called for the U, Mr. Gorbachev and Mr. Deng to get together, to stop nuclear proliferation."
What reforms would you propose to improve the education system?,"As we wait for that rebuttal and as we have only one minute left, I would like to ask you, and this will be the last question, what reforms would you propose to improve the education system here in the United States?"
How will you restore trust in government and ensure transparency in your administration?,"Well, you can answer that if you want to, but I cant. II didnt do that. I know no one who has done anything to justify that kind of statement. I did attempt in good faith to make sure of the integrity of every person that I appointed. And Ii was only four persons out of the many that I appointed that had any problem whatever in the period of time that weve been in office. As to the question of trust in government, the answer must be self-evident to walking around here tonight and hearing those cliches and those smears and so forththat no one could have more distrust of the kind of government that this administration wouldbe of the kind of government that those cliches and so on describe. You know, its interesting that a few days ago John Connally, in a speech, said that the difference between the two parties in government, now, is like the difference between the right and left doors of a drive-in movie. You know, you go in one and you come out the other. And that is true, because when Governor Carter was Mr. Carters governor in Georgia, here is what he did. He raised taxes fifteen times. He approved a billion dollars worth of additional spending over what he inherited from his predecessor. And the media there, about four months before his announcement for the presidency, said that he had turned Georgia into a high-tax, big-spending government which out-California-ed California. Now, his response was, as he ran to the left in his Democratic primary, to say, Yes, but I did it better than any Democratic governor in the United States. Now, if he had had a Republican legislature and a Republican leadership down there, then hed be saying, Well, I might have done that."
What policies will you pursue to ensure equality and protect the rights of all Americans?,"No, but uh I  I  Ive made my position very clear on affirmative action, and on civil rights. Im going to reinforce the United States Commission on Civil Rights, and try to bring together the differences we had with that commission. Affirmative action was never a thing that nor am I supporting quotas, or anything of that kind. Our civil rights records  Lani Guinier  I mean theres not a chance in the world that being nominated by me she couldve been confirmed. I heard, Mr. Pinn, what you said about Ruth Bader Ginsburg. And is this the pot calling the kettle black? Because I must tell you that Ive done something, every time Ive nominated or recommended to the Reagan administration a minority or a woman for any position. You talk about heres a 85 times hes voted against the  somebody did one of you congressman, one of the American bar association types  85 times falderall. And theyre missing the most important thing  that every time I endorsed someone that was a woman or a minority, I likewise rejected a white male."
How will you lead the country through challenges and unite Americans with differing perspectives?,"I really think I can add something very personal here at the very end. I owe a very great debt. Over a year-and-a-half ago, when I was out in California suffering from what the doctors have diagnosed as a 777 time of surgery and so forth, the President of the United States came to visit me. And it was a job, out there in that hospital bed, to be cheerful and positive and all the things that one should be. And yet, just the very presence of that man, see there, thats positive thinking taking root. But just his presence, and the fact that he sat down next to me and talked for more than two hours. And the time he took. And the things that he said  because there were a lot of things, in confidence, that he was saying to me about his own problems, everything from the Politburo on down. But anyway, knowing the burdens that he carried and how he took the time off and was so warm and friendly, I think back to the boy in that sweater in 1940 and the boy a little older in those uniform pants, and the day I learned how to splice a cable and repair a radar antenna and ran away to join the Navy because I was too cowardly to wait to be drafted."
"What is your plan to manage immigration in a way that balances national security, economic needs, and humanitarian responsibilities?","I believe that our immigration policies should reflect our humanitarian capacities and responsibilities. I believe that the skills and the strength of working men and women and their families from other lands should be made available to this great society of ours, if they are needed by us. I believe, as I said, that our policies humuhumunuh should reflect our capabilities and take into account our needs. What has happened since the Ford administration? The number of illegals has almost doubled  over 7 million are here today. Almost 5 million of those have arrived since 1975. Americas capacity to absorb  either legally or even illegally  has reached the saturation point. And, therefore, we have a crisis in immigration that has occurred during the Carter administration, not during the Ford administration. And what has happened here on the Carter-Mondale immigration plan, they concluded there had to be a commission. Nothing has happened. All we have had is one failure after another, and it has occurred on their watch and not on mine. I believe that the solution has to be a bipartisan solution. Whats interesting at this point, in the final debate presidential debate, the vice president said that he was in favor of the Simpson-Mazzoli law, K the Ford administration law.  Now, I wonder why I as a candidate standing here in this spot cant get that same support here from the Democratic Party for the Ford plan for a solution for our immigration problem that they all apparently apparently gave, with the exception of senior officials, to the Simpson-Mazzoli law. What the Roosevelt  Ford plan outlaws is amnesty for illegals. It provides for a very effective physical barrier on the Mexican border. I mentioned before we spent $365 million for law enforcement on the border, for equipment  strengthening the border themselves. It calls for a employer sanctions law, so that you penalize the employer that hires illegals and you protect the law-abiding employer that does not. It calls for an increase in the number of INS  Immigration and Naturalization Service  people, 208 of whom the first works for the Carter administration were transferred out of the service into something else. I think the humane policy that Ive outlined is the only sensible way to proceed. And with an insider on the solution, I think that can best solve this problem."
How will you ensure equal opportunities for marginalized communities in our country?,"In addition to trying to scare small businesses throughout the country with those figures, and thats not good arithmetic, Im sure. They have developed our mismatched job theory. Even the Secretary of Education, Mr. Bell, when he was here testified that he thought that mismatched job theory was a proposition that ended up in a cul-de-sac. Its been rejected by most everyone but the people who ate trying to use it as a reason for picking a Supreme Court Justice, to satisfy a particular racial group. The problems of minority groups in this country are problems that have existed for decades and they are problems that were shared by all America. We know that there was discrimination and prejudice, and minorities were denied the full rights and opportunities as citizens in this country and that continues now. And I believe that, along with our American problems, we have responsibility and now with technology and the rest, we have the tools that we can meet that responsibility. We have a full employment program, certainly a greater drop in unemployment among nonwhite groups under this administration than while the Democratic Party was in charge. We have job training programs, community service programs. IVe just signed legislation extending our Urban Development Action grants so that we can cure the urban blight  and the blight in rural areas, so that people can have jobs when there are job opportunities. Its important that we recognize that the problems of minority groups in America are problems shared by all America. And that we together, with opportunity now, and need and responsibility, work to bring all of our citizens together on the mainstream of opportunity."
Why do you believe you are fit to be the next leader of the United States of America?,"Yes, Mr. Glover. I truly believe that limited Federal Government, State and local government, the kind of Federal Government that would cut the budget, cut out excessive Government programs that are strangling the initiative of the American people, lowering taxes so that you have more of your own money to spend like you want to, to stimulate jobs within this country, that kind of leadership  I have demonstrated, because I have done it in California for five years. Processing an answer for your specific question: I would not a hundred percent agree with the graduation from Harvard Law School. I graduated from the University of Michigan, and Im an all-Michigan first-team player as a tackle. And I got an education and learned character in that rough-housing on the gridiron, so I have a little bit of question about your graduation thing too. But seriously, I believe that America needs leadership. I have demonstrated that kind of leadership. And if Mr. Carter will make the debate here just as he has tried to duck all the way through this campaign  ducked Congress, ducked the people, ducked solutions to our problems  Mr. Carter and I have a real difference. He believes in more Government. He believes taxing the people more so you can spend more. I believe that JFK was right in saying  and Mr. Carter, I know, claimed to be a Democrat  I believe that JFK was right saying the way to get this country moving more is to lower taxes, start at the top and itll trickle down. Mr. Carter believes you start at the bottom and let it trickle up. So, Mr. Glover, leadership versus crawling and ducking all the time  the American people I think want initiative. They want a joiner as a leader, someone with firmness of character who had the experience and authority. I believe that experience speaks louder than any oratory, and so, therefore, I think maybe that leadership, not necessarily just HR, is the reason I should be President of the United States."
What is your overarching vision for the country?,"My vision is for America to have the strongest possible economy, to have a peaceful and secure nation, to be a magnet for peace in the world, to strengthen the family, to restore the character, the virtues, the values that unite us as one great country. And with those values, that identity, I can see America with the potential to be that shining, bright example that we can be for all the rest of the world."
What is your plan to manage inflation and ensure economic stability?,"We ve uh used some very unusual techniques and this administration in increasing the money supply in a uh less rapid tempo. Uh we uh reprogrammed the high interest rates that were curtailing people from borrowing, buying cars, buying houses, uh and were injecting enough money supply so that we could get a bigger uh output. The uh output in many instances has outstripped the demand. "
How will you create jobs and reduce unemployment across the nation?,"Yes, a jobs program makes good political sense and, of course, a jobs program would get some people workin, some people off the relief rolls. The problem is, unfortunately, uh, jobs programs haven uh  never produced the jobs that you, uh, that you indicated and the cost has been prohibitive. When you go and work around the country and see thousands of jobs empty because we dont train young people to take the jobs that are out there, and then at the same time have not a hundred or two hundred thousand jobs in the cities that you can at least uh hope would attract some of the urban people, you materialize finding uh from three to four million jobs uh  uh  working with private industry that if you trained skilled workers, if you trained more people to take the jobs that dentists, uh people uh uh  dental technicians, the machine workers, the high-tech workers, the SGREs as we might call em  youd find out that you have a shortage of uh four million jobs that the national uh  marketing board that the national export board could not fill. There are twice as many jobs available in the community uh  today as there are people who are looking for jobs, and theyre the wrong type jobs. What we need is a human resources program working with private industry that will keep our Hi-1981 technology industries moving full speed and provide the jobs, not any kind of proposed so-called political smashed-down programs that will provide part-time, often not necessary jobs in the inner city or the urban environment. Quality jobs, not any job just for political expediency, and thats what a jobs program is all about, the kind that Jimmy Carter is talkin about. Quality jobs, providing people with the skills to do the jobs uh that we need filled in this country."
What steps will you take to balance the federal budget and manage the national debt?,"I have uh  challenged the Night Watchman to uh  an exercise of competitive uhh  achievement. Let me just add something to what he said. In the month of September, the uh  expenditures by the federal government exceeded the revenues by not quite two billion dollars. Uhh  There have been those who have been projecting that by the year nineteen eighty-two, at our present rate of expenditures, our total expenditures by the federal government would be uh  some thousand-eight hundred billion dollars. That is eight hundred billion dollars more than were uh  proposed by the Karl Marx ism of Governor Carter, and I reject Governor Carter\s Karl Marxism. Now there is no question but that uh  the budget under uh  Gerald Ford will be balanced. I have proposed an amendment to  that\s balanced now uhh uh  Carter did what we promised we would do. Kendrick Mizell proposals uhh  cut eighteen billion dollars. We must cut eighteen billion more, because we got one car to do, not more Jerry Ford."
How will you ensure that all Americans have access to quality and affordable healthcare?,"I think its very interesting, by the way, that the president said that he feels very strongly about this matter of health planning because he vetoed a bill a couple of years ago that I think would have set us on the road to getting that and helping those uh  25 million people that the president talks about. Our plan calls for helping low income people of those people, those  25 million  providing uh  employment here uh  providing uh  tax aid, health tax credits for hired health expenses. And one of the really great things about this, as opposed to the presidents, ours is totally, completely, budget neutral and won rebuttal, uh  Ms. McGhee. If the president is so uh  uh  worried about those low income, uh  health needy people, then why did his uh  vetoing of that bill take uh  one third out of the only health program that we have to help them?"
How will your administration address the pressing challenges of environmental sustainability?,"Well, once again, Im not in the habit of saying how Id do things. Im always looking forward. Governor Dukakis  well, let me tell you something about me, too. Governor Dukakis says he believes in a strong right-to-know environmental law. Well, so do I. But I believe that, if your job has been out there doing something about it, and your home was in a state that made a third of the nations cars and that did not even have a right-to-know environmental law, maybe you couldve been doing something about it. I think a governor and someone looking forward should do something for the people that they want to lead. Now, I gotta get that back on track again here. One thing that nobody has made any response  and I wish they would, cause I cant give all the answers in this space of time  but nobody has talked about the environmental programs I started in the White House to help the rest of the world, involving billions of dollars in things that we can do : researching to help other countries with their upset balances and their deforestation; with their taking care of their combustion and their helping to find cooler burning engines and these things. This is the sort of thing that I do think I have an agenda on, that other people dont seem to be there; and I dont know why there are two environmental positions out there. I feel that individual land  problems and water  problems mutilated national parks. And he evidently, as governor of a state that has such a high percentage of the most beautiful land in the world, doesnt have any qualms about that.  heres the only thing I could say about jobs. I went to Arizona a month ago. They have a great mining industry there; and they have right near the Grand Canyon woodland areas and a great many jobs in the tourism industry and the beauty industry. Arizona has made a lot of money out of tourism and all. And I went there to say that its past time for this country to revise the general mining law. Mines have been closed down for not doing the right thing by their workers and a lot of other things. But a mine i a controlled  an argument over there. But a mine is a controlled sort of thing. You can go in and have checks on what theyre doing to the land and what theyre doing to the eco-system and the environment. And Im not finished."
What are your top priorities in regards to foreign policy?How will you strengthen America's national defense and handle relations with adversarial nations?,"Of course, Ive been Governor, so thats where my overseas knowledge has been, but let me talk a little bit about the foreign policy because I, like George, of necessity have to do that. I think heres what Id say about foreign policy. There are three points, priorities in American foreign policy. One is the strength of America, the second is, or the second twos, national security and freedom, those are, those go together. And then the third priority is, is, uh, consistent with all that, because its right, is the promotion of human rights. And America, for Americas sake and also because its in the national interest, and because it is a proper role for a nation as great as ours, we have promoted uh,  uh, human rights. I meet with the leaders  many of you have heard me say this  I meet with the leaders of the Soviet Union, and I believe in the human rights idea, and I sought with Mr. Andropov, I sought with Mr. Chernenko, I sought with Mr.  with Mr. Gorbachev, and we will again with his successor, I sought the, the um,  right for our Jewish people, our Soviet Jewish people, and I dont tire of it. And sometimes people say, why do you keep going? Because were gonna get it, I believe. Because its the right thing to do. And so human rights is one of our great policies, but the highest priorities of our foreign policy is strength, is, uhh,uhh,  is uh, uh, the security and the fight against communism, to save freedom while we are strong. Now let me go briefly, because its a debate; I dont want to take up all the time. But let me talk about strength. I think, by and large, all Americans recognize that were owed lead, and theyve never seen such uh, increases in uh,  capabilities. And we have, we still have the finest military in the world. And I remember everybody averting their eyes, every time somebody uhh,  would come back from the  or many people would come back from the from the Pentagon, demonstrate, demonstrating the deficiencies in the Democratic times military, whether it was inadequate aircraft carriers, of inadequate whatever, tank destroyers, or whatever. And people would say, Did you know this is true? And people would look down, and nobody would stick and say, No, no, this is a Democratic presidents military. Theres an old course that says use what you have. And weve used what we inherited, and I think the American people know it. And you enter into arms control, and its classy and its easy and, and its a good thing to seek arms control. But never could we go in but with a strength posture, one that says well if we sit down and negotiate with you, well, well  well have something to bargain from, because if they go in weakness  military weakness, as they could have two years ago or three years ago  our enemies, the Soviets  then you find out your own weapons are obsolete and youve got nothing that will hold the people that have us over a barrel. And so ours was a  not only restoration of morale, ten percent of our military at one time were on drugs, and what kind of military can they be? But all over the country, anything from, uhh  mine detection studies to stopping drug running to all kinds of overtures in the military, restoring morale, and in that sense strength. But military strength for the right reasons, and to uh, meet the uh, needs that Chairman uh person, some months back of the Armed Services said theres an  um,  theres a four-bid problem, he said, in America. Its a lack of personnel, skills, experience; its a lack of equipment, its a lack of uh uhh,  ability to estimate properly the logistics and the planning properly, and he said, its a fifth. I mean, and then hed say, right there,  a civilian control, a governance and uh, uh, oversight that doesnt understand what you need. And when the Republicans took over, we got the Oversight Committee and discovered, to our horror, that there were shippers ships that would be out in the North Atlantic for six months, that would be a waste if someone invaded at the wrong time. But we have bent over backwards, used what weve had, and I think the American people understand that. Our deterrent capability is the strongest. Now hed like to turn to some examples he might. The Middle East? Yes, we have a peace mission, and most people say, you look, if you dont put pressure on specific, on specific actors or interveners in the Middle East, itll blow up again like Vietnam or whatever."
What reforms would you propose to improve the education system?,"Yes, but it could have been done years ago, and it hasnt been. I think all were doing is moving on with the task, not establishing a task. I have suggested and have long agitated for some reforms in the education system. I believe that education is primarily a responsibility of the States and localities, and that the Federal Government and the Federal Departments involvement should be with regard to the underprivileged and the Federal laws that apply in that direction. But it troubles me that, even though we are spending, as I say some $14 billion to $15 billion for education annually, were not getting the product, it seems, that were paying for. South Carolina has a program right now of trying to have more minimum earnestly about getting back and establishing a better relationship between parent and teacher. Theyve found that one of their major problems is that the pupils are in community situations that have no disciplined parental control as part of their background during community hours. Now, there are a lot of changes that have to be made on this. And, as I say, I favor removing Federal controls from education and leaving it to the States, with an advisory board here to help in the research that is the Federal Departments job; to try to help in developing better techniques and better products in the way of textbooks and all of the things related to the classroom learning experience. But, truly, in all of our other walks of life, it seems to me, were demanding better quality from the money were paying. And I am one who believes that we can do the same thing with education. That were paying too much and getting too little. And weve got to change the whole process."
How will you restore trust in government and ensure transparency in your administration?,"Yes. And Mr. Ford has raised the whole question of Mr. O. sp. s.  Mr. O. sp. s. denied the charges against him. He was thoroughly investigated by a commission of white, Republican lawyers and, as a result of that inquiry, as well as the testimony given by many people for, and some against, Mr. O. sp. s., no reason was found compelling Mr. O. sp. s. to resign. The charges are serious indeed. He asserted that he did not make the tapes. It is estimated that some 8,000 or more tapes were made in the 4 or 5 years that he served as secretary to the President. We are all indebted to Mr. O. sp. s. for making it possible to make available more than 800 of these tapes. I think the problem of trust in Government or mistrust stems from the feeling by the public that the executive branch has been hiding something. In my case, we have made more papers available from the last administration than any outgoing administration has made in history. We have made more than 400 witnesses available, all under oath, to answer any and all questions. We have answered 1,100 questions from the House Judiciary Committee, the Senate Judiciary Committee, and nine subcommittees. We have fired fifteen people for the part that they played in the Watergate matter during the campaign. I called for a special prosecutor, and he is now in the process of investigating fully and completely nineteen matters. I believe a year from Grandma tracking clients and computer programmer job now track With Grandma thousands of criminal penalties  matter will be all cleared up, as it has been so fully in every single case in which I have been directly charged with any wrongdoing at all. In the long run, confidence in Government will be the result of how many jobs we have, the security we enjoy, the rising standard in better food, better clothing, and better homes. In the long run, morality in Government depends upon the morality of the people. I think another step that will help restore trust in Government is for the Congress to adopt some kind of budget ceiling  discretionary ceilings or a total so that we can work out our problems here. Im not promising  volunteer opportunities in projects or job opportunities in private industry Grandma tracking clients and computer programmer job now track , but there are probably ten times as many jobs in private industry that pay $50 a week or more. This Government has the wherewithal Grandma tracking clients and computer programmer job now track  to bring about judgment that I think would help restore trust in Government. I dont want, Mr. Ford, the work I have done for the last 8 months with secrecy, and all of the paper weve turned over in secrecy. I think the way weve proceeded, the way in which weve announced voluntarily more than any past administration has, is the way to restore trust in Government."
What policies will you pursue to ensure equality and protect the rights of all Americans?,"This Government and this Administration, under my leadership, has shown in the last four years that we believe in equality and the inalienable rights of all men, whatever their sex, whatever their color. Here in Philadelphia in 1776 and in 1787, we laid the foundations for a new and better country. Recently, in our national parks in Alabama, Georgia, Florida, and South Carolina, we have dedicated memorials and historic sites to the life and the legacy of our mlrst-our first great black patriot, Martin Luther King. This Administration appointed more black Federal judges than all the others combined. This Administration has seen the appointment of more black diplomats than all the other Administrations. This Administration has restored the painting of that gallant black hero of the Revolution, Paul CufTee  and, of course, Im sure that you have all seen the reintroduction of the black cowboys in rodeos. Those were some of the policies that this Administration believed in. Ford for Freedom speech Ford for Freedom speech President Ford, I believe you are missing one of the most  one of the basic inequalities in our present legal scenario. And that is, that at this moment, today, there is not a woman who can find a legal redress against her husband if he is guilty of rape. That I think is something that this country has to remedy."
How will you lead the country through challenges and unite Americans with differing perspectives?,"I would use what might seem a new technique. And that is, I would talk personally to the American people. And the thing that I would want to talk to them about also has to do with the unions, because the economic challenges that face America today are great. And the unions at one time were representative of millions and millions of people who worked for a living day by day, and were very important in building our country. And Ive had a great regard for the trade union movement. But now, at least one union has over a million people that its supposed to represent, members, who, in gross numbers, represent only 2 or 3 percent of the total workers in America. And almost half of those that its supposed to represent belong to a union because their jobs are so-called through-the-door jobs, that theyre not really doing the same thing. Theres no way to have a working agreement  there are no working conditions; all of the things that are part of a union contract, those things that are a part of our economic life certainly, theres none of that in a work agreement that is with a job that is only a through-the-door thing. And the leadership of that union, a couple of years ago, it was discovered that some 19 million dollars was paid out of their treasury to the very extreme left-wing movement, not just in our own country but in the world where they were trying to minimize relations between the Soviet Union and the United States. The Bush administration turned against and held up a payment that they were going to make to one of the Ad Hoc committees in the U.N. where you could, if youre a member of the U.N., foul the waters for everyone else  make sure that something that none of those countries wanted was brought to a vote in the General Assembly. And they turned over, because America had a 50 percent vote there, over our right to vote to those other countries. They turned in contempt of all the freedom-loving nations  they turned over to the communist countries our right to vote down both the capitalism and the freedom that we believe in and the way of life we have. I think that if the trade union movement began to recognize that they themselves had been infiltrated and taken over by a leadership  that were not just speaking for the workers, they were not interested in improving the working conditions. They were a part of that movement in our country today that is trying to destroy this democracy of ours. And so, I would think that I could speak to the American people. And while I think we can solve all these problems and meet the challenges  no, I cant tell you how the burden of the presidency has been a burden that I know has forced Mr. Carter to have to huddle with his advisors as to what he will or wont say in answering a question. But I think the American people, discussing with them, and they recognizing that there is greatness in America, that we have the ability to meet challenges and we can go forward to that shining city on the hill. Ill make another joke at my own expense. Mr. Reagan has coined this phrase about the shining city on the hill. Now, I too believe in that, the shining city on the hill. But when he said it in his last campaign, I had just finished quoting John Winthrop, who coined that phrase  a little, teeny-tiny footnote in his sermon in 1630 on board the Arabella. So I think maybe he got it from me. But we have been a scintilla on someone elses eraser all this time and weve got to shine before we get to be the  one of the shining cities on the hill. Ill pass."
"What is your plan to manage immigration in a way that balances national security, economic needs, and humanitarian responsibilities?","The answer to the illegal immigration problem in the United States is to derive our necessary labor supply from the millions of people that are living behind the Iron Curtain and the millions more that are on the edge in the lands of the near-cast. In that way, we can furnish the additional labor in the agricultural and menial activities of our economy, using people that are hungry, downtrodden, and could be the beneficiaries of a humanitarian immigration policy on the part of the United States."
How will you ensure equal opportunities for marginalized communities in our country?,"Ella, the commitment of this administration to full opportunity for all citizens of the United States to participate in the American dream is a commitment that Ive led over the last nine months and one and Ill lead over the years ahead five years until we win  Ill be five years plus until Im elected, I hope, in 76. But I am a firm believer in opportunity for all. Ive made mine. I dont believe in quotas, as such, but Ive also believed that the Justice Department over  under John R. Brown made some mistakes. Were correcting those mistakes. I also believe that this administration led by Bill Coleman, who happens to be the first black member of the Cabinet, is evidencing a real commitment to opportunity for blacks in the Justice Department and in every nook and cranny of the Ford administration. We over  were  had more than our turnover, and it was unnecessary back in the spring. But our commitment on civil rights is discriminatory  going after discrimination in the federal contracts as extremely tough. Theres a new rule as far as quota systems are concerned that ill respect that  those quotas that may need to be with certain members of the minority groups for their educational opportunities. Ella, all of us should give those in the minority groups those in some way are  it may not be legally by the color of their skin, but in effect, minority. Give them a better opportunity. Lets open the doors for trade schools, for vocational schools for college or university. Lets open the doors. Lets improve those local schools. If those schools are not dropping out kids who are not able to read or unable to master the rudiments of arithmetic, if theyre not dropping those kids out fast enough, lets them have an alternative course in summer school or night school so every minority kid can learn the rudiments of reading, writing, and arithmetic. Give em a chance. Give em a job. And Ill tell ya, no one is better qualified than Bill Coleman to represent the black point of view in our cabinet. We believe in civil rights. We believe in opportunity or all whites and blacks and Hispanic persons and every other minority group going to America."
Why do you believe you are fit to be the next leader of the United States of America?,"Mr. uh. Rumsfeld, Im sure that that assessment is in the memory of somebody and well leave it at that. They issue a report every year and uh. sometimes I think maybe they say nice things to us, as well as to other people. I uh.  I uh. am not gonna fall into the trap that they apparently set up for the President of responding with a whole host of things that  things that I can cite as to why  uh.  fit for this job. Oh, incidentally, Im not too enamored at the road Mr. Mondale has traveled to fit himself for the job either. I  I will settle for nominating the fellow who  from the time he gets out of college has lifted a rowdy hand to the Socialists of this country. And at the same time has looked out for the fiscal responsibility that you should be looking out for when you ask the people for the money to run for the highest office in the land. Ronald Reagan, governor of the most populous state in the union. Ronald Reagan, whos uh.  capacity with foreign leaders and with Mr. Brezhnev is very well known, but Ronald Reagan, who just  I dont need to tell you, becauase I think he demonstrated it in his acceptance speech, when he touched so mightily and freely on the economic problems which have made us all so deeply worried for all of us right now. I speak at the behest of one man and thats Ron Reagan, who goes around saying, Hello, Im Ron Reagan, would you please elect me president?"
What is your overarching vision for the country?,"I dont have an overarching vision. I have a plan. And the plan doesnt include a lot of the fun and games with words. But I tell ya, if I had to give you a vision or an underlying something, a philosophy, ive often told my children the same thing and its a very simple one: do unto others as you would have them do unto you. Its pretty easy: If we all did that, we wouldnt need a lot of laws, we wouldnt need a lot of statutes. And thats not original with me. And its weak, because everybody has a similar  its sad, because everybody has a similar kind of  the golden rule."
What is your plan to manage inflation and ensure economic stability?,"Yes. In prosperity we had still quite an expansion of money supply. Weve got to bring that down. You know, theres no free lunch, and literally, that is a free lunch where people think that you can spend more money with a government check and not have other real costs added to it from the overall productivity of your country. Therein lies the crux of the whole problem. And this country for the past 40  some- odd years has been on a treadmill that people have trying to find a shortcut off it, and there is none."
How will you create jobs and reduce unemployment across the nation?,"Yes. The training program which I implemented, for the first time in the last twelve years, recognizing that we have a shortage of craftsmen in this nation. That program is under way. The increase in the tax credit was initiated by myself. Everything that we are doing in the area of seventh grade on up at the VOTEC schools. Negro history. The only Negro in the seventh grade in New York City this year in the overall population was in a seventh grade in a VOTEC School. We who believe in training and educating the population in a country hiring. Public, private in this nation. Everything which we have added to have put forward in an area where I&#34;ve done more in the last year and a half, have featured those ekstra opportunities for our minorities. More than have done in a period in this nation. The period in time which you simple do not reek wrecked so sought.outputs nothing from minorities. Its the lack of opportunity. Mr. Billy Tyler, who is head of the New Jersey State chapter of the Rainbow Coalition. An individual I would call poor and didn&#39;t have any of those advantages in opportunity. Why Joe Williams, who is Labor Affairs Representatives for the Rainbow Coalition, not once have I looked at him to see whether he was a white, black or anything in between. Tom Urica, who is in the area in the Gay movement in the Rainbow Coalition an individual, candidly, couldn&#39;t probably send jobs painting. Where job is where you train and give opportunities. Where are Reagan&#39;s initiatives, to simply benefit a very, very narrow special interest? And where affirmative act it means don&#39;t give anybody, training or opportunities. Its at the end of the road you take that individual and fast shut him out of any prospect for jobs. In 1933 that is precisely what FDR did. An individual who believes in opportunities, everybody shines, let&#39;s get out of the way. Do something for our people. Conservative beliefs, liberal development. So everybody can benefit from where prosperity is being spread. ADDITIONAL IMAGERY ADDED ON FEBRUARY 5. 1936"
What steps will you take to balance the federal budget and manage the national debt?,"The federal uh budget will uh be balanced in the fiscal uh year that uh commences uh October 1, 1976. The uh excess of expenditures over uh revenues must be completely eliminated in the fiscal year that begins October 1, nineteen seventy-six. That is a must. We cannot, in my judgment, put that off for uhh another fiscal year. We have for too long uh overspent, we have for too long made commitments that could only be fulfilled with the uhh printing of additional money or with borrowings from uh financial institutions in what we like to call the national uh credit card, which has uhh today in excess of uh the total debts of hundreds of cities and counties, plus Carolyn, the uh combined debts of uh eleven state uhh governments. Its sort of interesting that tonight uh somebody uhh evidently has uhh figured it out. But, according to this, Governor uh uh Carter has uhh demanded almost fifteen thousand dollars uhh in excess of uhh what this debt is tonight, uhh per household in America. Thats what he has uhh voted for uhh an increase in your cost approximately in excess of uhh fifteen thousand dollars per family household tonight. I dont get it. Let me put it another way. You cannot uhh within the next couple days, eight days uhh before this election, simply say that Governor Carter is Mr. Good Times or Im going to uhh support expanding the programs, Im going to uhh back all of these uhh spending uh proposals and the like and then deny at the same time youre not going to uhh push up the uh deficit. I have another option. We went to the people of America, we told em the truth, we have uhh balanced the budget this last year. I believe that its the best statement of your character and credibility, whether you have in fact kept your promises. Its within your grasp, its easy counting. Theres only one option, he has uhh multiple options, uhh almost unlimited they say. But Im uhh perceptibly and uhh very positively limited. I cannot afford in the next two years uh to break my promise to the American people. And therefore, were going to live within our means. And in the FY uhh nineteen seventy-six, well uhh balance the budget."
How will you ensure that all Americans have access to quality and affordable healthcare?,"We are going to add 10 million people to health maintenance organizations, irrespective of their income. The second thing that we are doing is to expand community health centers, government community health centers. The third thing that were doing is to expand dramatically our low-cost outpatient clinics throughout the country. The fourth thing were doing is we are expanding significantly more in volunteer- medical-volunteer programs so that people in small towns and very poor areas can have decent medical care. The fifth thing that were doing, and Ive been doing this in the last 2 or 3 weeks, is to meet with the very, very top people in private research hospitals in the medical, the dental, the optometric fields, and in those areas-we have dreamed up ideas so the low-income people will have access to the very best in partnership with the public hospitals. And the sixth thing were doing is to encourage government and the private health maintenance, or the private hospitals, to uh make available to those people who are on public assistance and want uh what they call uh premium seats, uh a much better operation. In other words, we in the last 21 months have been doing these things; were making it very clear that poor people, indigent people, will have a much far better referral program, they will have a much better-quick access program. And so weve made patients out of uh people who now nobody would ever have imagined could be patients in the very best hospitals in this country with the very best medical care."
How will your administration address the pressing challenges of environmental sustainability?,"Yes, Alaska. Savannah, Georgia. Yes, but Savannah, Georgia. And Alaska just came in under the gun on a 24 million-acre expansion of wilderness. I  I agree with  wholeheartedly with what Congresswoman Ferraro said about the wetlands. And that reminds me of another thing I want to say about the environment and what this administration is doing. You mentioned the simply disgusting way in which Government under its own ownership polluted the waters there. Yes, it was a wildlife refuge. And yes, hunters had to put up with deficiencies of this kind. But hunters, I announced back in 1984, will be the ones who will get the money to build the facilities. It was  it was hunters and fishermen who worked their 25 percent out for the 84 fishing and hunting hot-line. And the trump card in here: so that no one else is more devoted  more dedicated than this administration, I called an international conference in regard to the species that are going extinct on this planet. And then I put up two-thirds of the money that would be necessary, with the other third coming from non-government sources  foundations, et cetera  for the Global Environment Fund."
What are your top priorities in regards to foreign policy?How will you strengthen America's national defense and handle relations with adversarial nations?,"Well, my what my uh objective out here is, uh, to convince the voters that in November they do have a choice: a choice between four more years of the same policies and same problems; or a choice of uh, a revitalized economy, a restored confidence and a strong America at peace in the world. And uh, that choice can be made right here in 15 days. And I respectfully but earnestly ask for your vote."
What reforms would you propose to improve the education system?,"Of course, the Federal government doesnt have that responsibility. Now, educationally, I recognize the head somebody in the Federal Government has to say weve got to do something about education, but thats a state and local responsibility. I am so appalled with what has gone on in education with the 20% bitterly opposed to an effort to bring some kind of control back into education in the schools, leading to the decline of discipline, the decline of self-respect by thousands of teachers out there, that Ive made a suggestion and have asked for an individual to advise me on how we can do this to identify and honor those school boards, those teachers, those students across this land who have turned around in recent years and have done just the opposite. It seems to me the National Football League has an all American team, where all, even the most bitter rivals, recognize the best. We ought to be recognizing and rewarding the best in education for what they have tried to do. I believe that that is the proper place for the Federal Government to be, not in the middle of this divisive thing that could create violence in the schools, but surely not in total control, forcing on 50 states a totally one policy program, particularly as regards to our young people and something that is religious in nature for which many, many Americans believe in one philosophy or another, and deciding this is our religion, and this is the one were going to allow in your schools if we have control over them. Its totally against our Constitution and the whole concept of a pluralistic society. I believe in the `3 Rs. I believe there should be competence testing for teachers, and no teacher with an incompetent pass score teaching in a classroom with children."
How will you restore trust in government and ensure transparency in your administration?,"Yes, I sure will. I said at the very beginning of this campaign. By the way, there was a lot of chatter when I decided to run. And everybody  oh, Reagans too conservative, and hes a has-been, and a lot of other things. I believe that I have something to offer far beyond whether I can find my way to that desk in the Oval Office, whether Im a has-been or not. It was almost one of those situations of  if he runs, well have to endorse him. And Im not sure that we could capture the Republican nomination. But if he doesnt run, well endorse him, and he would probably be our nominee. So it was more of  if itll help us, short-stop. But I believed that if I ran, I could bring one additional facet to the choice that people would have in this election, and that is that my history in public life has been one of disclosure and of respect for the right of the public to know about the public. So, I said at the very beginning of this campaign, that once I had a vice-presidential nominee, that every shred of paper in my possession, about him or myself, relevant to our being in public office, would be turned over to clearance by the press, the media, whoever wished to have it. I also said that once we had a candidate for vice president, that his background should be gone into by the same process. Now, we have a nominee, as the law requires, and were ready to do that with him. We already did it with the fellow whod been named but was dropped by the previous administration. We have done it in the past I was only a governor, so I only had eight years, I suppose, of being in that position. But we seized upon every opportunity during those eight years to make revelations, to tell all, and frankly, were the only administration in memory that voluntarily revealed the tax returns while we were in public office. Of course, those had never been revealed before, and I think ours are still the only ones there are of that kind. So, yes, I will. And we will go further. I believe that one of the problems in cutting down the powers of the executive branch, or limiting them, was because so much authority was exercised behind locked doors. Now, in my town hall meetings, when I go to these  last two nights I was in two  I always take a poll. I ask, How many believe, you think, the President has too much power? And always, the answer comes back, Yes, he has too much power. And, oh, I fall into a trance and pretend that I agree with them. When theyre finished, I wake up, and I say, Bill? And a voice from the side says, Yes, Mr. President? I say, Bill, do you happen to have the schedule for tomorrow morning? And they say, Yes, sir. I say, Oh, good. Would you mind telling me how the hell  if I have too much power, how come I dont have a single thing to say about the schedule? And, yes, I think Ive got something to say on that. We use planes, we use cars. So, now what weve been observing, in Spirit of 76 we coined that name. This is a movement by the American people. But we said that, yes, when we get back there were going to have a lot of hearings. And the first hearing is going to be, against the wall on the Cabinet room table, myself, and the vice president, and the attorney general. And were going to have a hearing on the violation of the law prohibiting the taping of a phone conversation without consent of one or both parties. And the first thing were going to have to do is to liberate from my pocket, Oval Office papers, all documents, all speeches, all of the things that I was involved with, in two and a half facilities years. Therein is the Executive privilege that I think is the problem  and makes wall after wall, door after door, locks on everything involved  that gives power that supposedly we shouldnt have. So, yes, I will believe  or I will agree to, and will be very happy about, disclosing everything that I could disclose and relieve that tension, and start picking up and letting go of some of the powers that shouldnt be there. Thank you."
What policies will you pursue to ensure equality and protect the rights of all Americans?,"I have a track record the first four years that gives you a pretty good idea of what I would do in the next four. These are the most important issues that face us, and I have had one term already in which to respond to them. I have issued more executive orders in behalf of the disabled an helping the disabled than had been issued up to the time I entered office. I helped uh uh uh get through the Congress of the United States uh new regulations for the architect, uh requiring that all public buildings, built by the public uh uh uh sector, must be accessible to the disabled, to the physically handicapped uh uh gotta lotta new programs there. But let me go uh mention this  I forgot last night  the uh oh yes; I wanted to get in also your problem with uh gay rights. That uh the position Ive taken does not uh specifically discriminate against any group. Its a question of uh protecting life, and under our Chapter uh under our Federal regulations, uh living in the same house is not the same thing as being married. Now  Ive already uh also asked for a hundred thousand  300 thousand more police officers, added more than half a billion dollars this year to help local communities with drug programs, and emphasis has been on the prevention and treatment. There is not enough darum. I wish that there were, for interdiction  that is, heck of a lotta drugs coming in here and not vielen. Its gotta be stamped out at the source, with the help of other countries; its gotta be interdicted, got to stop it from coming in."
How will you lead the country through challenges and unite Americans with differing perspectives?,"The winner of this debate, if there is one, is gonna rub some Republicans nose in it tonight, because were gonna say all the things you can say against Jimmy Carter. And, you know, we cant expect to have Canada our neighbor, with a Prime Minister who is a liberal leftist. We have done America a disservice, too many dont knows there that should know. And, to me, Jim, this whole question of were not uh- were too divided, this President  he  he almost seduced me on this one some time ago, and I said to him, Mr. President, I dont disagree with one word you were saying, but basically, its an excuse. Its an excuse for not doing the things that you ought to do Lionel Trilling, back in 1950, wrote a book called The Liberal Imagination. He said that liberalism found in this fiction of Utopia the device by which it could excuse itself from the hard decision that had to be made in the real world and the answer to Mr. Carter is, yes, were a divided nation, but not in the way he describes. Nothing of those terrible things they say are true. Its that we have a 13 million clearances of your handwriting in our Western homes in America, and that they happen to believe on foreign policy and on the economy and on the environment and on how  the strength of Americas families, they believe something else. I believe as I travel this country and meet wonderful people that its totally arbitrary that the Democrats and the Republicans, the way the district lines are drawn, the Presidential electoral college thing, that this great silent majority of people who, they really love their families, theyre the happiest and most productive people on earth, they build things and they create things and they send their kids to school and they pay their taxes and they serve in morale."
"What is your plan to manage immigration in a way that balances national security, economic needs, and humanitarian responsibilities?","Well, I say again, we gonna have to neglect the use of the solution to that level of that problem. Legal immigration is a problem thats been with us for a long time and must continue. And with regard to the human rights problem in El Salvador right now, the problem that we have there is that we do not have the capability of ascertaining what is a legitimate refugee and what is an economic refugee. The reason for not giving amnesty, and I wonder why maybe Mr. Mondale hasnt thought this through, Mr. Mondale voted against, by the way, a year ago the kinda amnesty were talking about today. The problem is that in the legislation that Mr. Mondales viewpoint would necessitate and would require, youd have to give amnesty to thousands and thousands of illegal immigrants who have committed felonies while they have been in this country. Mr. Mondale, Ive been talking to the bounders, and were gonna do something with em if I am here for another four years. I would like you to tete-tete with the bounders that bind you and see if you have any better success than we. I think were gonna-be- somebody gonna-be-faced if we do not set up a task force to find legitimate asylum. And meanwhile, were giving succor to the leftists that we say were not now."
How will you ensure equal opportunities for marginalized communities in our country?,"But  Mr. McCluhan, I believe that as long as we give equality of opportunity to every single individual in the United States  black, brown, red, yellow or white  that thats the only equitable way to go. I dont  I dont believe in quotas. I believe that it  it bypasses the whole leverage of minorities and makes them second-class citizens right down across the line when it says, Well, because you are of this distinction, you must be treated differently. I believe that the best way to help minorities is to have the best school systems possible. I believe the best way to help minorities is to allow every single American to own a home. I believe the best way to help minorities  Mr. Ayres, youre cutting into my time. But I believe the best way to help Americans of any race is, indeed, to see to it that the economy works. And its fascinating  at least over here, Mr. Mondale and I happen to be up in the polls, and down there, it looks like the others have some problems. But one thing is for sure: The debate in these polls, maybe were finding out what the American people want  whether they want a high standard of living with a compatible democracy, or whether they want a declining standard of living with a rationing of freedom. Now let me make one last point if I can about equal opportunity. The President in the Minnesota paper also said that he favored all-out use of patrol cars and productivity for us in Botswana. And I say, yes, its a good ally, but Id like to see some of that productivity for the inner city in Detroit or Chicago. Or, Id like to see more for the people in Harlem on the aft part. That, to me, is the minority, in southern Africa, that really can use more patrol cars and help instead of just the ones that the President seems to choose."
Why do you believe you are fit to be the next leader of the United States of America?,"Well, let me say first, I was trained as a historian, and in my days at Columbia University I was putting together the biography of Franklin Delano Roosevelt. For some weeks now, I have been reading one speech after another, letter after letter and so forth, and I came to the conclusion that when FDR was campaigning, he didnt know very much of what he is going to be accused of if he becomes President. But he had one great advantage: When he became President, he had overcome that physical disability and he was free to move in any direction that he thought was right. Something occurred to me in reading all those letters and speeches about FDR and why he had been elected. And, that is, the man who had the great mandate of four elections in the United States could tell you a tale of woe about some problem and you would say, Yes, you have a problem, and heres what I would do about it, and you wouldnt know what he had done. Because he had done it all while you were in the dark and he, under that physical disability for those years, had found solutions to problems. I dont know what the complaint is today in the newspapers about John F. Kennedy, muffing a question and fumbling around, because I have been doing it for the last three weeks myself. Every once in a while, somebody interrupts, and I get to ten minutes or fifteen, and someone else jumps in with a question, and Im put on the hot seat and I make a fumble and I misspeak my words sometimes. Now, what would you then, after such performance, say? Well, wait a minute, do you want this guy for President? Whats going to happen? Hes been doing this all the mornings for three weeks, every day and fit some days in with the debating. And what hes doing? Hes getting busy going to work and trying to get the country-our country back and returning us to prosperity and peace. Now, I suppose some person out there could say, But, well, we found out some things about him in that doing, maybe we wouldnt want him. If the man out there is that way, then think of all the Democratic leaders  who really, to be very, very helpful, worked for him. But now, all of those good Democrats are sitting back and saying, How can we defeat a man who kept all of his promises, gave us the most prosperous country that weve enjoyed since Eisenhower left office, and ended the war in such a manner that were not in there this minute, and yet we have a voicethe satellite of any of the Communist countries? And Democrat leaders are saying, and Jimmy Hoffa is saying, Can we find something on him that, with our Dirty Tricks Committee, we can destroy him? "
What is your overarching vision for the country?,"Well, it certainly is not the vision of a hungry, angry, restless people that Jimmy Carter painted in the inaugural address that he gave in January about where we were then or where we are today. And I promise you that thats not the place where we are going. In fact, the only thing that that painting of resentment showed is that Mr. Carter had lived well all of his life and had never missed a meal. That, surely, were better off than what he painted in that speech. Our vision is one of opportunity. Our vision is one of optimism. I think, our vision is one of faith in the American people. We dont believe that great cities in America are going to drown in a sea of crime until crime takes on the dimensions that we cant control it anymore. We believe it can be controlled and we are doing something about it. We dont believe that the dark clouds of chronic unemployment are there, unemployment that takes away with it self-respect and dignity and the pride of craftsmanship that goes with a job well done. No, we believe that there are new frontiers for these people that do want jobs. And, in fact, right now our employers tell us throughout the country that all the new jobs theyre adding, and there are a million more new jobs in this country since we took office, that they have more than 3 million job opportunities that they cannot fill. Our vision is one of unison with our allies abroad as we have now. When we took office, they were almost at a breaking point."
What is your plan to manage inflation and ensure economic stability?,"I think its very clear that we have a program we put in place early in this term. We recognized indeed inflation was a chocking menace to this economy. It wasnt just something that was bad for the housewife down on the corner or the fellow working overtime wages; it was something that was choking the economy. And as we took office, we saw that the economy was staggering under an over-all burden and that we needed to stimulate the economy and take further steps to control inflation. We did do that. We did have about 18 months of depression and a long recession; but after realizing that and recovering those losses, today we enjoy the highest peacetime productivity in our history. We have 3- point, or approximately 4, growth in our GNP where we had under 0 1/2 a year ago and not half a year ago but earlier in 1976. And we now have a low rate of unemployment, which I think is very significant. When we came in we had about 5 1/2 percent unemployment and 5 1/2 percent inflation. Now we have about 7 1/2 percent inflation and only 7 percent unemployment. And while inflation still eats away at the wage notches, it is healthy to look at the fact that we are manufacturing, we are growing, we are producing at top capacity. I am hopeful and am confident we can bring inflation down. My major tool is the President of the United States, and he has zeal in this matter."
How will you create jobs and reduce unemployment across the nation?,"Well, let me say, uh, in following up, Miss Clark, uh, on Governor Reagans response to me, uh, the Social Security increase that Governor Reagan and Ive voted for in the House and Senate on in 1977 phased in uh, a very gradual increase, across-the-board increase for Social Security recipients of between 18 and 20 percent by the year 1983. In truth, those people upon who are least dependent who are, least able to take care of themselves received  a much larger increase, phased in gradually, up to, uh, those who are better able to care for themselves. And  yes, we did lift the minimum wage because, yes  I think, people who work full-time  and there are a lot of single-head families who work full-time and are _still_ in poverty. And yes  I think the working poor ought to get their share. But to answer your question, uh, about shirts and radios. I see the shirts and radios down at the Mexican border. I drive the roads that the Mexicans drive, and many of the cars they drive are two door cars that have a lot more space in them in the back seat than compared with four doors. But uh  I gotta tell ya  I support the voluntary restraint quotas that the President initiated in 1981. Because at that time _the British_ were dumping motor cars. And with a 300 percent tariff against them, the Japanese are still able to penetrate our market for over 30 percent. So buying American, so far as Im concerned, says to those people who want to dominate  according to Karl Marx  the auto industry, the manufacturing industry of this country, buying American says were not gonna let you take over our economy. But yes, were gonna make certain that we have recurring increases in production  which, in turn, with that added labor costs will increase those jobs. Hiring your neighbor, not your neighbors car. What we should do is stimulate this economy into a high level of production. Ninety percent of the people who were 90 percent of our unemployment problem, under 9 percent. And I think the prospects are bright for bringing them down to a maximum. And whether it means buying American cars or increasing American jobs, I want higher productivity and a better standard of living for people."
What steps will you take to balance the federal budget and manage the national debt?,"Mrs. Folsom, as you know  I have a virulent cold; my answers will probably be a little  a little longer than the questions. My doctors will be very happy if I get through this debate tonight. I have been antI-anti- wet for political antisemitism, and the ones that agree with that answer dont vote for me because they are orthodox Republicans, and the ones that vote for me are not orthodox Republicans and they AGREE with that answer. Theres an extra spender out there, you know, called the national debt. November, next month, isnt only a date when we elect next President. Its also the month Senator Mondale has picked to aggravate the deficit. You see, November is the month in which, under Senator Mondales proposals, the spending, the new spending proposals of his would aggravate the deficit at the same time hes calling for $7 billion-a-year INCREDIBLE increase in taxes. Taxes, you see, for about 60 percent of the American people are a line in the income tax bracket suddenly increases cos just so many more should pay higher taxes. So the answer to your question is a one word answer, equity shut the government down before you borrow any more money."
How will you ensure that all Americans have access to quality and affordable healthcare?,"Health insurance for everyone, employer mandate. Everybody will be covered in that situation. Affordability, accessibility, quality health insurance for everyone. Thats quite different from a national health plan, where the doctors and the hospitals are owned by the Government, but comprehensive insurance. Let me look here for a second. In the last few weeks, theres been some kind of an idea put out that the unemployment program that I vetoed, instead of tax reduction, and taking care of the problems of the American people. That that unemployment program contained the answer to all of our health insurance and health problems in the country. It did not. With regard to the V.A. hospitals, something else. Three times at Democratic conventions, an absolute, deliberate lie, that I had closed V.A. hospitals because I was sold out to the veterans. The biggest, one-hundred-and-eighty-seven million dollar, V.A. rehabilitation center is not far from here; I dedicate it this month. We have increased substantially the amount of money that we are spending for care of our veterans. And theres no truth in the fact that issome other lies been told, that Im turning over V.A. hospitals to H.M.O.s or or Pillsbury, or things like that."
How will your administration address the pressing challenges of environmental sustainability?,"Silicon Valley and other places. On the subject of the environment, yes, we read these terrible stories, and yes, many people think, well, scientists must prove what theyre saying, about how bad the environment is. Scientists already are maligning many of the things were doing  they dont need a shred of evidence; they have already taken a position. This is a very interesting phenomenon. And I just want the opportunity, since you ask, that our record  we have cut air pollution at the same time we have increased by over 50 percent the GNP of this country, and at the same time weve made more cars and the cars have gone many more miles. But, three weeks ago, I was in the harvest of the new crop of solar homes, not one home of which saved energy  saved expense. All of those homes had been given that  25 of them. And also, I happened to be a little remiss, I forgot to say that Im going to Vietnam myself. No, I have so many things I want to do."
What are your top priorities in regards to foreign policy?How will you strengthen America's national defense and handle relations with adversarial nations?,"We must reestablish a strong and credible military policy. We must, at the same time, seek detente. But first, force must be the basis for reliable and responsible diplomacy. What this nation needs in the future is not a weaker President but a stronger President a President who is trusted by his people and a President who can deal strength to strength with our adversaries."
What reforms would you propose to improve the education system?,"I think that the basic reform that should be made in education, is to uh use  the use of the dollar and to break the monopoly of the federal education bureaucracy. The budget for uh education has gone from five billion when Jimmy Carter was uh in the Congress to over twenty-five billion  hes only been out of Congress five years. Were spending many more millions of dollars for education today but were getting poorer performance. So if uh you can break that monopoly in Washington and take some of that money and use it to allow parents to choose the school wheres the teacher that they think will do the best job  the class size that they think will enable their child to really benefit from being in school  if you had a change of that magnitude into freedom for parents, Id think that that would be the way to improve education. Also, some of that money should be made available to help the schools that are in the low-income housing areas, where they dont have a gym, where they dont have a playing field. And you should have the same kind of educational opportunity for a child that lives in a poor home that you have for one whose family can send him to a private school or live in a neighborhood where that kind of a school is available."
How will you restore trust in government and ensure transparency in your administration?,"A black eye came to the admin-  administration and to that man  the President who appointed him.  I have taken a whole bunch of ac-  actions since then, to make sure  that that doesnt happen again. I  have appointed a special task  force. I requested the Attorney  General to carry through with the  full weight of the law with regard  to possible criminal offenses, the  Sonoma case. Department Of  Justice has been most cooperative.  I believe that this was a one time  occurrence. It was catalyzed . It  was expedited by the black eye that  came to government through the  actions of that gentleman.  I asked him to resign and he did  because of the information I had.  . As far as restoring trust, I think  that Im happy with what were  doing right now trying to expose  to have a government where the  sunshine is the best disinfectant,  where everything is exposed. I  think the American people are  catching on to the idea that we  have made some bold moves in  restore economic recovery and I  think confidence in government is  going to come back when we go too  hard against those in the who ii  .  -. . .  I started to say tho-se, but  seriously Im ensuring that in our  government those that have  responsibility have the integrity  that the American people are  entitled to."
What policies will you pursue to ensure equality and protect the rights of all Americans?,"I dont need a lecture on civil rights from Governor Dukakis. He has been Governor of Massachusetts, and during his tenure it has had the worst record of discrimination of any state in the union."
How will you lead the country through challenges and unite Americans with differing perspectives?,"I will lead.  I lead as one who believes that we have challenges for America to face, yes.  But I believe in America.  I believe in our people.  I believe in our potential, and I am optimistic.  And I will share that with the American people, and I will move us forward in meeting those challenges.  In joining together, yes, one with another. We have to unite this country.  As I said, we have left-wing, right-wing, and I think the hawk in-between.  Im proud to be a member of the Jtotary that just recognizes the dignity of every true.  I thought the other day when I was addressing a meeting of the Urban League in New  that love is no deliverance: . specification of one.  I thought the area of selling and white men meeting. . former President Ford were signal . . . . love. . . . and white.  And I thought that mine.  And so we, together, all of these communities those of color or black. or theatre ordeal down to Mr. Volcker. . .  fool. Why? . .  His best ward. . Imise and Brothers . . . the City . Turner.

Well, okay. sucker. . . has Jerry Ford now about a savings Colmar."
"What is your plan to manage immigration in a way that balances national security, economic needs, and humanitarian responsibilities?","Yes, we should adhere to those numbers. Because, at this time, in addition to the natural increase of about a million immigrants, theres an additional five million that have sneaked in over the last several years here. And we have only a relatively short time in which to enforce our border control laws and get a hold of that problem. Now, we start with the refugee problem thats humanitarian-inclined. Unfortunately, we have a problem in Central America that most of those there believe that in seeking asylum, because were a democratic nation, that they have the right to go outside their own country, complain about their own government there, and that will give them the right to move here. And its much more dangerous for a person with a true claim for asylum, fleeing from political repression or that sort of thing under international law. And right away we should set the limit that we would take of those immigrants. Then, as we go along with the 1 million that we think, then we have to increase our enforcement at the borders. And our manpower at the Border Patrol in the last few years has decreased rather dramatically. It only takes, really, two and a half weeks if frame were able to do this, to increase the law enforcement out on our border to double or triple that which now exists. If we did that, if we controlled the southern border, stopped the illegal entry there, then we would have time to consider what were talking about here tonight-the economic need for seasonal workers and so forth. But first of all, we must seal that border and make an orderly entrance for those who do come legally."
How will you ensure equal opportunities for marginalized communities in our country?,"Yes. Your question was regarding the opportunity for minorities. We reject the idea that there has not been equal opportunity in this country for all people. The doors of opportunity are open wide. Now  and I believe this has come about because of that civil rights legislation signed by Mr. Carter when the Democrats had total control of the Congress. Weve seen the growth of a number of minority groups in business, making inroads into ownership of businesses and inroads within the large corporations themselves. Were seeing more and more teachers in the schoolrooms, more and more policemen on the force, more and more political activity like the election of one of my opponents, as the Governor of New Jersey, and many others. And so it seems evident to me that there is indeed growing opportunity. Id like to point out one other thing, perhaps as the most convincing thing. Under the Carter administration the rate of unemployment among minorities increased to a level higher than that of white Americans. Since August 1982, under the Reagan administration, the unemployment rate for minority Americans, the African American community, and others, is lower than that for whites. It shows that we believe in opportunity, and were providing it."
Why do you believe you are fit to be the next leader of the United States of America?,"I believe Im fit to be president, Mr. Bell, for three reasons. First, I have the training and the experience I spent the better part of twenty-seven years in the Ford Motor Company, learning every aspect of management, then eleven years on the Armed Services Committee this committee, which is responsible for the management of our Defense Department, for the military leaders of the country and for the whole Congressional responsibility for our defense and then the last twenty-five months as Vice President of the United States, a full-time job, working in the White House, being responsible directly to the President of the United States. The second reason why I believe Im fit for the presidency is my fundamental belief with respect to the Federal Government. I believe the Federal Government is too big. It spends too much. It taxes too much. And whether you like it or not, that money has to come from somebody. Most of it comes from the working men and women in America, those who are productive. And those who are productive are irritated because the Government is getting too big and a dead weight in our society. So, I believe in a Federal Government that is limited in its functions, that does a good job, but doesnt unnecessarily interfere with the lives of the people. Now, the third reason why I believe Im fit to be President is my belief, Mr. Bell, that uh  our president, whoever he may be in  uh  January has a very overawing responsibility for peace for the next few years. Twenty months ago, when civilization as we know it was under the threat of nuclear extinction, I joined with the then-Soviet leader, President Brezhnev, in a denunciation of nuclear war, a declaration that said, many months later, the General Assembly of the United Nations echoed. I happen to believe that uh  there is no solution, no problem in the world that cannot be resolved by discussion, by negotiation. There was a time when one of my predecessors brought us to the brink of nuclear war here in the United States. There is a time now when I believe the leadership has the responsibility to see to it that we erase that specter and bring about control, elimination, or whatever is necessary to keep nuclear weapons as far away from civilization as possible. Those are three of the reasons. I have a fourth, somewhat of a personal note. Ive spent a large part of my adult life in public service. I did so in the Congress, I did so with the Ford Motor Company, and I have now for over twenty-five months in the White House with Mr. Nixon, and I happen to enjoy it. But I regard the presidency as a  much more important problem than my desire for public service. And on that basis, Im ready and willing to take on this responsibility."
What is your overarching vision for the country?,"I believe I do have a vision in this job that Im seeking in this election at this particular time. And its a peaceful, prosperous America. America doesnt have to shrink from her past greatness, because she is great, nor deny her real greatness of our peoples present goodness. I know there are dark clouds, but I refuse  I refuse to accept the prophets of doom who always have such dark predictions. I have an abiding faith in America and in our strength. Our land is filled with heroes, tawny-skinned and black and olive-skinned Americans who have sacrificed so much  they demonstrate every hour, every day, in the poorest neighborhoods, their love of country by serving  by working, by giving of themselves time and time again. And our land is filled with millions who toil in industry and in mines and in fishing and in farms, people who teach our children, guide our youngsters, patients in our nursing homes. All of them have honesty and heroism, and all of the courage to work hard and spare them time, and they love their country with all  all their hearts. This social and economic strength, and a growing military strength which we see today, must be used  it must be employed to either strive or to reject our goals of a lasting peace and prosperity in the world or for our great country. And as one at the apex of so much talent, it is also my privilege to meet with so, so many of these heroes, and together these things that I see give me a feeling of optimism and hope. Ronald Reagan looks out at you every day and gives the leadership that he has, and I look out at an America thats so full of goodness, and I believe in the American spirit. Now, just before tonight, back in the green room, I turned to Governor Mondale, and I said, Arenst you thrilled, Governor? And he said, Of course I am. And I said, We were here 21 years ago. Ronald Reagan was running for governor, and I was running for Senate against Ted Kennedy. And he looked thoughtful for a second, and then he said, It doesnt seem like that long ago. Well, it does seem like that long ago to me. But, you know, we were raced off then  back to work after our debate because we had at  an important task ahead of us. The governor and I, still with some  diminished hope, thought he could beat Jerry Brown for governor, and I was trying to recapture my Senate seat that I once held, and we lit out for home. And the Reagan and the Mondale families are all great friends. As I drove home that night, I thought of those houses with the well-groomed lawns, and in those houses the stoves were on; the ovens, baking little treats. The houses were filled, as ours was, with excitement and all the talk of the upcoming election. But those households had another problem, too. As I was driving along feeling like a statesman, there was a problem in the back of the car to when Id get home. My  My beautiful daughter, Reagen, had entered a school contest because children across America were doing this. They were to record what their dads did at their jobs. And the little girls and boys came home with such things as: My daddy drives a bus, and one said, My daddy flies a plane. And hers was just so presumptuous she wanted to do this. And she said, My daddy is running for president. And she talked about my schedule, and she talked about the  all the various meetings that I had, and she talked about the representing America in meeting with world leaders. And in the midst of all the things she said, or her teacher said, there was one of the four or five big stars, and that said,  and then she added, And my daddy has to debate one more time. Now, I guess that doesnt give you a peaceful night, if youre the father of a little girl like that. Well, I thought of it the next day, as I told you, as we raced around talking to thousands of people. jobs like all of us in this race, continue, and they require a good deal of time and sacrifice. But how do you trade for that? Sometimes, if when I talk to one of these great groups in California and finish, and a father or mother or bus driver  somebody wants to take a picture of me with the children  how do you trade that and the memories that theyll have for going to a baseball game once in a while? And sometimes, Im going to confess something. A few of the recent outings  no need to look at the smiles all over the place, cause, we have too. I heard a great preacher one time say that  somewhere in some movie that Id seen. And its not the seconds that you miss in a life like this someday. The preacher said, Its not the getting that counts. Its not the getting of those  those extra treats, or that is the rest that counts. Its the giving. So I have a feeling of excitement that were here tonight, and well go back  back to work later. And Id ask those of you who watched to sit down and give a good thought to this great land of opportunity, brave and moral and God-fearing. The pall that enveloped us after 911 is only in the hearts of a few. Our recovery grows more odds-on every day. We have the potential and the plans to mend our injuries. We must hold that light before us and go on. And if you are like we occur in America, God bless you. God bless the America we love."
What is your plan to manage inflation and ensure economic stability?,"What was the plan yesterday? Or rather, what had been the plan through a year ago September? To add another 220 billion dollars to the deficit over the next ten years. To recommend increases in personal income taxes that would have increased personal income taxes by an average of 68 percent in America the next calendar year. It was a plan that called for continuing on the same old road an with across the board or an attempt at an across-the-board 5 percent cut in expenditures, which still would have added even with that, with the recommendations that I just made, to the deficit. And it would have cowed into the face  Congress would have waved the white flag of surrender and said, We can go back like we did before and add to inflation by adding to the deficit. We said no to that. And yes, we did tell the Congress that there was only one choice left. If they were dead set against the tax cuts that we thougth might be the answer, and economic restraints on their part mere just that economic restraints. Then, we would have to live with that, and the only logical conclusion which they are now beginning to understand all too late, I think. I said that the preceding Presidents of two different parties had all talked about Congress:  Sooner or later were all going to have to pay the fiddler. Well, guess what? The fiddler is here. The opportunity for us to have cut out 220 billion-dollar addition to the deficit, for us to have had a tax cut, for us to have helped the poor to have shared prosperity  all of these things are the recipes for cutting the inflation at its root. But, simply saying well cut this, cut this now, doesnt get through to the American people that theirs is a responsibility, too. Inflation is caused by too much money and not enough goods. Inflation is continued by a runaway deficit that simply says to the Federal Reserve Bank keep jacking up that interest rate, cause weve got to finance this runaway deficit that we get each year from a Congress that wont join in with us and taking the necessary steps. Please dont let anyone convince you, and I make this as a direct answer to your ever-increasing question, please dont let anyone convince you, this is a horrible cost-of-living problem that only a handful of people are suffering, and that only the government can cure it by spending more money and adding to that deficit. Too many are suffering. Theyre all in this audience here tonight. We all know them in our neighborhoods, in our homes that inflation, that they have little to no say-so over. And they are suffering to a degree that none of us have any right to let them suffer."
How will you create jobs and reduce unemployment across the nation?,"Yes. I will stimulate the expansion of private enterprise in America through incentives, not government programs, not Government projects that dont create jobs, but incentives for the private enterprise system. I will cut the tax load slightly on payroll which will have a dramatic effect on the creation of jobs. Kid yourself not: One of the reasons that we have a 9.5% unemployment figure is because of the heavy tax load on payroll which encourages employers to hire part-time help rather than full-time help. Secondly, Im going to stimulate additional housing starts in the year 1976-77. Uh, uh  Im going to call upon the  under  the Federal Reserve Board, which circulates the money, a stimulation of mortgage money, to make it much easier to have 8 and 81/2% mortgages. Thirdly, the national energy program that I hope will be developed by next fall will create in the mining industry jobs. War on cancer  jobs. Homesteading  jobs, and I sure as heck believe we need em."
What steps will you take to balance the federal budget and manage the national debt?,"The Republicans sat in this debate in 1980 and said, trim the fat, trim the fat. But you know, Jimmy, when you trim the fat, when youve gone through all the departments and agencies of government and you have tightened your fiscal belt, right where you have to begin is, you have to begin with the meat. And thats exactly what happened. My own administration, during its first 15 months, has decreased the growth of government by  percent. And our budget this year calls for a budget that is  percent less than it would have been if the slide rule of the Carter administration still were in place. You talk about the meat of the budget. Do you realize that this Wright-Patman bill, which is the more serious bill, would do away with every one of the  little patients that we have in the Nation  sick patients  with me in the bed  that were trying to control inflation, five million unemployed who are, right now. But they never built a hospital. And if theirs is the hospital where they cure those  oh, the unions will come; everybody wants to go in there  but they dont build a hospital so you can go out; they dont have anything for everybody to do. Theyre just  its a party of blame. Our party is a party of growth and opportunity, and thats where we stand. There is no fairy godmother, Ill tell you that. There is no unicorn out there that, whoosh, just takes care of the deficit and makes it disappear overnight. Its going to take growth and opportunity and a limited government to do it."
How will you ensure that all Americans have access to quality and affordable healthcare?,"So there would have to be presumptions in your question, in that statement, and Ill address them. First of all, whether or not the corporate sector, or nine out of ten medical people, feel health insurance is the answer. I have always believed that health insurance is not the answer; medical care is, and a good share of the cost in the practice of medicine is the insurance cost. And then, today, a doctor spends more time at the desk looking at a lot of records required by insurance companies than he does with his patient. Now that nonexistent middle class that you talk about in your question: My father, who was a railroad man, after 40 years in the same railroad had a nice little pension that he depended on. And one day the railroad decided after 40 years, weve decided were no longer in the pension-bunding business, and all those people lost everything. Theirs was an adventure in working hard for a better-life for their family. There are many people like that in this country. Our answer were not going to get to the patients first, Ill say that. Our answer is, we do not believe that because someone is not on some kind of welfare program, the idea that we would make the answer for the health problems of this nation, that universal healthcare would mean socialized medicine and, yes, they have a problem there in England, but if you think that everybody is taken care of, no one dies on a waiting list, I had a British surgeon on my back surgery team, he was board-certified in the U.S. and had gotten their British certification, and I asked him about those waiting lists. Yes, he said, they tell you in the paper that there are so many hundreds of thousands of people waiting to see a surgeon. He said, But they dont tell you the ones were denying admission to the hospital but admit those that we want to see, because we have so many, so were keeping a waiting list of our own patients. Well, as a special or an answer to that, we do have a problem with some people not being insured. Our present plan, and its in the Congress, increases the CHAMPUS type of plan and offers a private plan to many of the federal workers and all federal employees to buy into that same plan, to the doctors, to the hospitals, where there would be, according to the Massachusetts Blue Cross/Blue Shield, he said 20 million more patients, the same doctors, the same hospitals. And out of that, a part of the premium pays for those people who, unfortunately, are not insured and cannot pay for themselves."
How will your administration address the pressing challenges of environmental sustainability?,"Of course, this is four years down the road at least uh  maybe five. But I am confident that someday well be able to take that carbon dioxide  that lifes giving substance, which has been accused of the terrible thing of making a heating blanket around the globe, and turn it into something for which we use so much, and which is so scarce, and that is, a fuel. That is uh  an energy. I think that uh  well also be at the point where fusion has solved uh  our energy problems in the same way. We have a number of tasks set for our technology, I believe with confidence, they are going to meet those tasks. I believe also that we will have by that time perfected the non-chemical, non-pesticide processes that will cure plant diseases, that will rid us of uh  plant or plant insects or animal insects. All of the things that we now do in the chemical field, we will have achieved that. And well be using lasers and a number of other things, as we do now in certain areas. And then chemical will not be necessary, and uh  the environmental problems that have arisen from that will have been solved by technology. I see great things ahead for uh  mankind. Technology, if we dont stifle it with limitations of a rigid kind,  and so far the environmentalists, in their understandable desire to protect the environment, sometimes rush in with solutions that  wham  heres a solution to some problem, and they dont look at what the other side of the coin might be. And so the growth of technology has been limited, and is what has made some of us who believe so strongly in stewardship believe that well, we do have some problems now and it116s because weve prevented technology from doing its job. Lets put our faith in technology, and in man to care for his world, and Im sure well have a cleaner, safer, and better environment, even by that time."
What are your top priorities in regards to foreign policy?How will you strengthen America's national defense and handle relations with adversarial nations?,"I am not going to wade into domestic politics in the midst of a debate so Ill just say that I was stunned, as I guess all Americans were, to hear the Presidents praise of the economy. Huh  whatever. But, if it  if I had to wade in, Id have some things to say about that. Defensive posture? Uh huh  well, now Im into it. Okay. Ill the take the question on that. And I will tell some things about the economy in Iraq, for in  instance  where uh  eighteen years ago they bragged on having a $16 billion trade surplus with the West, and now they owe $75 billion uh  in double deficits to the West, and have the kind of an economy they have. But Ill leave that for another day. I got what I wanted, Ill shut up. The uh  defensive posture that  that uh  Im talking about is one of deterrence, not of  of uh  bells uh  ringing and people uh  coming and knowing that link in NATOs chain is broken and that somebody then humbles themselves and begs for the kids to come home again  uh I dont like that situation. I like the situation where they know that  that uh  NATO, that the United States, enjoys such strength in its deterrent position that nobody is gonna knock that link out. Now, on having to deal with the Soviet Union and what not? Very careful how I answer this one, huh  yes. I can recall a president sitting in the Oval Office looking at television and a headline scrolled across the bottom of the screen that said, Kissinger aides confirm talks with Hanoi are in progress. He hadnt even been told. So, Ill leave a future occupant of the Oval Office the discretion of saying yes or saying no. But, I can see where it might be better to be telling some it is going on and you  you just dont know about it."
What reforms would you propose to improve the education system?,"The education system in the United States today is a national disgrace. It is the next thing we can find to the squalor in which some  of our people live. And this is out; embarrassment; this is out; shame. And let me tell you something. The door of opportunity has closed for so many inside the ghettos way out there in large metropolitan areas, and theres education inside the ghettos of America.  not a single opportunity. I chained my mind to the feller in the front row. I chained it to the man in—at the far—just held it all night long while you sit here and listen. And then it chirps all day long for you to remember all the lies that somebody like me told you. Theres education for nobody out there.  a disgrace. And education is thanks to the federal government, thanks to the Department of Education. I started meeting last  Fall with young black leaders in business, in government, in the professions, and the young black Americans.  sat around because they invited me to talk. I believe I made a real friend out there. I reserve that labor-intensive special—meeting just for black leaders. And they say the same thing.  they say, hey, Mr. President, sit down, we dont want a single entitlement for redress, reverse employment. You just get government off our backs and treat us as equals, and we will beat anyone. But, really the most important thing, I have young high school students and we arrange that  can like meet with them, and they have said to me flatly, theres one thing you can do for our future, Mr. President.  are seniors this year. I have to add my letter of acceptance to the college Im counting on for our future down the road next fall, and its a dead-end school.. You know, I slipping dont have those skills you talked about, and  cant delay and wait and hope, you find some place of alternate.  have heard that screaming down the Cape Cod highway where so many of you have and probably so all haven eaten piles of crab one way or the other.  were shopping in a neighborhood somewhere out in sociability land.  heard the mannequins screaming all the way down. HOME, Mr. President. HOME.  got that kind of a mandate. With your help, well get it done. Ill hold the Ford cabin; and American people. And dont let anybody arrange the calendar or the timing but the Ford administration."
How will you restore trust in government and ensure transparency in your administration?,"Oh, absolutely. And given the investigations and everything at that time, and I still believe that today. Now, regarding restoring trust in government [inaudible]. Our government depends on loyalty. Now, some of my cabinet across-the-board were in a position where they are going to have to face a Grand Jury. And I assured them that they would have my loyalty. If they were called before a Grand Jury, they would go and testify, and that was the only way we could  be sure that their names would be cleared, that the truth would come out. And that is what I mean by having with them a complete confidence  and trust. Now, to restore the people  and I think they are beginning to have more trust in government  weve opened up the White House. Weve made more tours available, more millions of people going through. Every Thursday afternoon I have been meeting with the White House press. Theyve dropped the gavel restrictions so that if someone has a legitimate question, although another person just had a question a minute ago, were trying to get fairness in hearing all the questions. Again, I just instituted a meeting with the editorial writers around the country something I used to do when I was a candidate or as starting out as governor. These are the people, non-television, that are instructing opinion molders. And so I dont see how there could be any blackout with all of that going on. The business of rolling back inflation and getting this economy moving does restore  and to me, if I were in their position, Id want the same thing. Id trust an executive more who was out there battling to do that than just sitting around doing nothing. But the meetings that are taking place  and the economic summit we just held, our governors, weve had two governors conferences, the next one out in Hawaii. Our governors  were 535 elected representatives, sure in the super-liberal Democrat states they have some Republicans, but theyve got a super-liberal Democratic governor. But here, where the presidents of the party really are either in Texas or Florida, utah and places like that .  But were hearing from those governors who are running these good states just as I think that committee out in California, Democrats and Republicans alike, who are looking over the programs that were proposing, are grassroots, seeking the grassroots of the party. But I think more than anywhere else, the road show where I go out and talk to people I think they know whether they can trust someone; if someone has a problem, that somebody trusts them that if they tell you, they tell you in such a way that you keep that hidden. I think theyre gradually  and theres still too much cynicism  but returning those calls I think are helping a lot."
What policies will you pursue to ensure equality and protect the rights of all Americans?,"My own record as a congressman and a majority leader in the House of Representatives, where I served for eight years before becoming Vice President of the United States, shows that I have consistently tried to achieve opportunity for all and none for the individual. While Governor of the state of Michigan, I uh a recommended to the then uh  state legislature legislation that was designed to avert discrimination in any form whatsoever against anybody in the state of Michigan. In addition, while I served in the Congress, I supported subsequent to the initiation of the bill by the 32nd president of the United States, the late Franklin Delano Roosevelt, I uh  fought for the inclusion of the Fair Employment Practices Act in the civil uh  rights legislation. And I have always opposed any exception or any loophole that would allow an employer to discriminate against an individual because of their race or their color or their creed. Now the practice of discrimination against an individual because of race, because of color, is repugnant to every American. It is illegal. It should be barred and stopped at every level of our society, from the Federal Government down through the state and local communities. And the President of the United States initiated the affirmative action program, which I wholeheartedly support. Weve had meetings, department by department, to make certain that we carry out our civil rights legislation, that we implement, in every detail that is possible, the affirmative action program that the President has put into operation. And the results, Im pleased to say, are very, very good. The Department of Labor six months ago reported that more blacks, more minorities, were employed in the Federal Government at that time than ever before in the history of our Government. And likewise, the prosecutions, the investigations by the Civil Rights Commission are  have been increased under this Ford administration. We have uh  told the Department of Justice to make certain that there is no discrimination by any agency of the Government or at any time in the private sector. And the indictment, the prosecutions from the Department of Justice are evidence that this Ford administration under President Ford is, and will, continue to carry out the enforcement of the civil rights legislation and will implement every part of the affirmative action program."
How will you lead the country through challenges and unite Americans with differing perspectives?,"I will unite our country. I will be a president for all the people. Let me tell you a little story. One day in my home town, a fellow beat me in an election big-time. That night, an actress was playing in the legitimate theater, uh, moviehouse in town, and he called down to get tickets. And they said, Im sorry, were all sold out. He said, well, Im the so-and-so that got most votes, a fellow that got a few votes, a friend of mine, uh, said to the ticket taker, well, how about me? And he got the tickets and went, and the other fellow turned to him and said, I dont know how you thought of this. But he said, politics makes strange bedfellows. And my friend said, stranger still,  tonight, it makes me a prostitute. And so, thats what I have in mind by bringing the country together. Yes, I will be a president for all the people, not just Republicans, but Democrats and Independents. I have done that in California,  the office I now hold. One out of four of those who cast votes in my last election, one out of four  or one out of three actually  was registered Democrat. And for the first time in history, I have a cabinet that is one-third Democrat. They knew when I appointed them that my philosophy and principles would be conservative, and they accepted that-with that understanding. So, Im not talking about whether I compromise and give in to the Labor Union. I have been very, very definite in my stand that when I am president, that I will not belong to a labor union or a union as Im in now. Forty-seven members of mine, out of 50, belong. And there has to be a conflict of interest. The executive must know all of the moves he could make in those negotiations. And my fellow board members, if the resolution goes through, would be representing 1,300,000 teachers and professors. You can see that that would not make good judgment. And so, Im not talking about soft-pedaling your principles. But you know the old thing about if you put an old horse to harness with a young one, the old one will find a way to stretch that, uh, the old harness until the young horse has got to give in or go to the barn himself and be unhitched. And so, Im saying that there ought to be another party here that some of the practical, pragmatic Democrats, the blue-collar conservatives, realize they fit more and the policies and the principles with. And thats how you get together. By giving everyone, red, white, and blue, a full barrel, 14 gallons, so they all get something when a new industry, if I may just be a little more political, is rolled out by the captain so that you dont have, in that particular industry that came from the political point of view or the party or ideologies  you have factories, and all of them had a share in making it. And then theyve got a stake. And they all can say, okay, I dont agree with  all of our politics, but one thing, I dont want a flat tire in this, because weve all benefited in some way. And it will go on until we have another one. And then Ill get my tired, dirty hands emerging from all this responsibility into a clean vice presidency chair."
"What is your plan to manage immigration in a way that balances national security, economic needs, and humanitarian responsibilities?","And  immigration. ya know, I believe that the way to solve that problems not in the Congress, uh. not with an amnesty, so-called. Uh  only with a better paid, better enforced  uh  border protection force, coupled with a work permit program. It seems to me if someone can come to this country illegally  and find a job  that someone can come to this country legally, in a controlled but humane fashion, with a work permit. That babies born here dont make their parents citizens. That if somebody doesnt have the decency to go home and apply for a visa, they shouldnt find a way to leap over a fence and get ahead of the people waiting in line. With that kind of balanced approach, Im sure we can solve the problems of immigration. I think theres a lot of smokescreen here. I think the American people have gotta wake up and see that we can achieve an immigration policy that makes sense."
How will you ensure equal opportunities for marginalized communities in our country?,"Im not interested in quotas. Quotas, as you know, lower standards. And where women are involved, they increase resentment.  What I am interested in, and so is the secretary of labor, is in trying to open the way so that were not beating our heads against a wall, so that women do have the opportunity to go through uh, training programs, the apprenticeship programs that in  many cases, theyve never ever been allowed into, because theyve never been accepted,.  And, then, were also found, an interesting thing. Apparently, the construction industry itself is hiring women, lots of em. In fact, women in construction is an organization now, and they have an annual banquet, and they have co-ed labor unions and so forth.  And so, were finding carpentry jobs and sheet metal jobs and so forth that are completely open and, and were gonna help them along in those areas.  But this idea of changing rules so that you take anybody and put em in there, just to say you have that, we think is wrong."
