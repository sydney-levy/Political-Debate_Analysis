Bill Shadel,"Good evening. Im Bill Shadel of ABC News. Its my privilege this evening to preside at this the third in the series of meetings on radio and television of the two major presidential candidates. Now like the last meeting the subjects to be discussed will be suggested by questions from a panel of correspondents. Unlike the first two programs, however, the two candidates will not be sharing the same platform. In New York the Democratic presidential nominee, Senator John F. Kennedy; separated by three thousand miles in a Los Angeles studio, the Republican presidential nominee, Vice President Richard M. Nixon; now joined for tonights discussion by a network of electronic facilities which permits each candidate to see and hear the other. Good evening, Senator Kennedy.",1960-10-13,Moderator
Mr. Kennedy,"Good evening, Mr. Shadel.",1960-10-13,Democrat
Mr. Shadel,"And good evening to you, Vice President Nixon.",1960-10-13,Moderator
Mr. Nixon,"Good evening, Mr. Shadel.",1960-10-13,Republican
Mr. Shadel,"And now to meet the panel of correspondents. Frank McGee, NBC News; Charles Van Fremd, CBS News; Douglass Cater, Reporter magazine; Roscoe Drummond, New York Herald Tribune. Now, as youve probably noted, the four reporters include a newspaper man and a magazine reporter; these two selected by lot by the press secretaries of the candidates from among the reporters traveling with the candidates. The broadcasting representatives were chosen by their companies. The rules for this evening have been agreed upon by the representatives of both candidates and the radio and television networks and I should like to read them. There will be no opening statements by the candidates nor any closing summation. The entire hour will be devoted to answering questions from the reporters. Each candidate to be questioned in turn with opportunity for comment by the other. Each answer will be limited to two and one-half minutes, each comment to one and a half minutes. The reporters are free to ask any question they choose on any subject. Neither candidate knows what questions will be asked. Time alone will dete- determine who will be asked the final question. Now the first question is from Mr. McGee and is for Senator Kennedy.",1960-10-13,Moderator
Mr. Mcgee,"Senator Kennedy, yesterday you used the words trigger-happy in referring to Vice President Richard Nixons stand on defending the islands of Quemoy and Matsu. Last week on a program like this one, you said the next president would come face to face with a serious crisis in Berlin. So the question is: would you take military action to defend Berlin?",1960-10-13,Moderator
Mr. Kennedy,"Mr. McGee, we have a contractual right to be in Berlin coming out of the conversations at Potsdam and of World War II. That has been reinforced by direct commitments of the president of the United States; its been reinforced by a number of other nations under NATO. Ive stated on many occasions that the United States must meet its commitment on Berlin. It is a commitment that we have to meet if were going to protect the security of Western Europe. And therefore on this question I dont think that there is any doubt in the mind of any American; I hope there is not any doubt in the mind of any member of the community of West Berlin; Im sure there isnt any doubt in the mind of the Russians. We will meet our commitments to maintain the freedom and independence of West Berlin.",1960-10-13,Democrat
Mr. Shadel,"Mr. Vice President, do you wish to comment?",1960-10-13,Moderator
Mr. Nixon,"Yes. As a matter of fact, the statement that Senator Kennedy made was that  to the effect that there were trigger-happy Republicans, that my stand on Quemoy and Matsu was an indication of trigger-happy Republicans. I resent that comment. I resent it because th- its an implication that Republicans have been trigger-happy and, therefore, would lead this nation into war. I would remind Senator Kennedy of the past fifty years. I would ask him to name one Republican president who led this nation into war. There were three Democratic presidents who led us into war. I do not mean by that that one party is a war party and the other party is a peace party. But I do say that any statement to the effect that the Republican party is trigger-happy is belied by the record. We had a war when we came into power in 1953. We got rid of that; weve kept out of other wars; and certainly that doesnt indicate that were trigger-happy. Weve been strong, but we havent been trigger-happy. As far as Berlin is concerned, there isnt any question about the necessity of defending Berlin; the rights of people there to be free; and there isnt any question about what the united American people  Republicans and Democrats alike  would do in the event there were an attempt by the Communists to take over Berlin.",1960-10-13,Republican
Mr. Shadel,The next question is by Mr. Von Fremd for Vice President Nixon.,1960-10-13,Moderator
Mr. Von Fremd,"Mr. Vice President, a two-part question concerning the offshore islands in the Formosa Straits. If you were president and the Chinese Communists tomorrow began an invasion of Quemoy and Matsu, would you launch the uh  United States into a war by sending the Seventh Fleet and other military forces to resist this aggression; and secondly, if the uh  regular conventional forces failed to halt such uh  such an invasion, would you authorize the use of nuclear weapons?",1960-10-13,Moderator
Mr. Nixon,"Mr. Von Fremd, it would be completely irresponsible for a candidate for the presidency, or for a president himself, to indicate the course of action and the weapons he would use in the event of such an attack. I will say this: in the event that such an attack occurred and in the event the attack was a prelude to an attack on Formosa  which would be the indication today because the Chinese Communists say over and over again that their objective is not the offshore islands, that they consider them only steppingstones to taking Formosa  in the event that their attack then were a prelude to an attack on Formosa, there isnt any question but that the United States would then again, as in the case of Berlin, honor our treaty obligations and stand by our ally of Formosa. But to indicate in advance how we would respond, to indicate the nature of this response would be incorrect; it would certainly be inappropriate; it would not be in the best interests of the United States. I will only say this, however, in addition: to do what Senator Kennedy has suggested  to suggest that we will surrender these islands or force our Chinese Nationalist allies to surrender them in advance  is not something that would lead to peace; it is something that would lead, in my opinion, to war. This is the history of dealing with dictators. This is something that Senator Kennedy and all Americans must know. We tried this with Hitler. It didnt work. He wanted first uh  we know, Austria, and then he went on to the Sudetenland and then Danzig, and each time it was thought this is all that he wanted. Now what do the Chinese Communists want? They dont want just Quemoy and Matsu; they dont want just Formosa; they want the world. And the question is if you surrender or indicate in advance that youre not going to defend any part of the free world, and you figure thats going to satisfy them, it doesnt satisfy them. It only whets their appetite; and then the question comes, when do you stop them? Ive often heard President Eisenhower in discussing this question, make the statement that if we once start the process of indicating that this point or that point is not the place to stop those who threaten the peace and freedom of the world, where do we stop them? And I say that those of us who stand against surrender of territory  this or any others  in the face of blackmail, in the s- face of force by the Communists are standing for the course that will lead to peace.",1960-10-13,Republican
Mr. Shadel,"Senator Kennedy, do you wish to comment?",1960-10-13,Moderator
Mr. Kennedy,"Yes. The whole th- the United States now has a treaty  which I voted for in the United States Senate in 1955  to defend Formosa and the Pescadores Island. The islands which Mr. Nixon is discussing are five or four miles, respectively, off the coast of China. Now when Senator Green, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, wrote to the President, he received back on the second of October, 1958  neither you nor any other American need feel the U.S. will be involved in military hostilities merely in the defense of Quemoy and Matsu. Now, that is the issue. I believe we must meet our commitment to uh  Formosa. I support it and the Pescadores Island. That is the present American position. The treaty does not include these two islands. Mr. Nixon suggests uh  that the United States should go to war if these two islands are attacked. I suggest that if Formosa is attacked or the Pescadores, or if theres any military action in any area which indicates an attack on Formosa and the Pescadores, then of course the United States is at war to defend its treaty. Now, I must say what Mr. Nixon wants to do is commit us  as I understand him, so that we can be clear if theres a disagreement  he wants us to be committed to the defense of these islands merely as the defense of these islands as free territory, not as part of the defense of Formosa. Admiral Yarnell, the commander of the Asiatic fleet, has said that these islands are not worth the bones of a single American. The President of the United States has indicated they are not within the treaty area. They were not within the treaty area when the treaty was passed in fifty-five. We have attempted to persuade Chiang Kai-shek as late as January of 1959 to reduce the number of troops he has on them. This is a serious issue, and I think we ought to understand completely if we disagree, and if so, where.",1960-10-13,Democrat
Mr. Shadel,Mr. Cater has the next question for Senator Kennedy.,1960-10-13,Moderator
Mr. Cater,"Senator Kennedy, last week you said that before we should hold another summit conference, that it was important that the United States build its strength. Modern weapons take quite a long time to build. What sort of prolonged period do you envisage before there can be a summit conference? And do you think that there can be any new initiatives on the grounds of nuclear disarmament uh  nuclear control or weapons control d- uh  during this period?",1960-10-13,Moderator
Mr. Kennedy,"Well I think we should st- strengthen our conventional forces, and we should attempt in January, February, and March of next year to increase the airlift capacity of our conventional forces. Then I believe that we should move full time on our missile production, particularly on Minuteman and on Polaris. It may be a long period, but we must  we must get started immediately. Now on the question of disarmament, particularly nuclear disarmament, I must say that I feel that another effort should be made by a new Administration in January of 1961, to renew negotiations with the Soviet Union and see whether its possible to come to some conclusion which will lessen the chances of contamination of the atmosphere, and also lessen the chances that other powers will begin to possess a nuclear capacity. There are indications, because of new inventions, that ten, fifteen, or twenty nations will have a nuclear capacity  including Red China  by the end of the presidential office in 1964. This is extremely serious. There have been many wars in the history of mankind. And to take a chance uh  now be  and not make every effort that we could make to provide for some control over these weapons, I think would be a great mistake. One of my disagreements with the present Administration has been that I dont feel a real effort has been made an this very sensitive subject, not only of nuclear controls, but also of general disarmament. Less than a hundred people have been working throughout the entire federal government on this subject, and I believe its been reflected in our success and failures at Geneva. Now, we may not succeed. The Soviet Union may not agree to an inspection system. We may be able to get satisfactory assurances. It may be necessary for us to begin testing again. But I hope the next Administration  and if I have anything to do with it, the next Administration will  make one last great effort to provide for control of nuclear testing, control of nuclear weapons, if possible, control of outer space, free from weapons, and also to begin again the subject of general disarmament levels. These must be done. If we cannot succeed, then we must strengthen ourselves. But I would make the effort because I think the fate not only of our own civilization, but I think the fate of world and the future of the human race is involved in preventing a nuclear war.",1960-10-13,Democrat
Mr. Shadel,"Mr. Vice President, your comment?",1960-10-13,Moderator
Mr. Nixon,"Yes. I am going to make a major speech on this whole subject next week before the next debate, and I will have an opportunity then to answer any other questions that may arise with regard to my position on it. There isnt any question but that we must move forward in every possible way to reduce the danger of war; to move toward controlled disarmament; to control tests; but also lets have in mind this: when Senator Kennedy suggests that we havent been making an effort, he simply doesnt know what hes talking about. It isnt a question of the number of people who are working in an Administration. Its a question of who they are. This has been one of the highest level operations in the whole State Department right under the President himself. We have gone certainly the extra mile and then some in making offers to the Soviet Union on control of tests, on disarmament, and in every other way. And I just want to make one thing very clear. Yes, we should make a great effort. But under no circumstances must the United States ever make an agreement based on trust. There must be an absolute guarantee. Now, just a comment on Senator Kennedys last answer. He forgets that in this same debate on the Formosa resolution, which he said he voted for  which he did  that he voted against an amendment, or was recorded against an amendment  and on this particular  or for an amendment, I should say  which passed the Senate overwhelmingly, seventy to twelve. And that amendment put the Senate of the United States on record with a majority of the Senators own party voting for it, as well as the majority of Republicans  put them on record  against the very position that the Senator takes now of surrendering, of indicating in advance, that the United States will not defend the offshore islands.",1960-10-13,Republican
Mr. Shadel,The next question is by Mr. Drummond for Vice President Nixon.,1960-10-13,Moderator
Mr. Drummond,"Mr. Nixon, I would like to ask eh  one more aspect or raise another aspect of this same question. Uh  it is my understanding that President Eisenhower never advocated that Quemoy and Matsu should be defended under all circumstances as a matter of principle. I heard Secretary Dulles at a press conference in fifty-eight say that he thought that it was a mistake for Chiang Kai-shek to deploy troops to these islands. I would like to ask what has led you to take what appears to be a different position on this subject.",1960-10-13,Moderator
Mr. Nixon,"Well Mr. Drummond, first of all, referring to Secretary Dulles press conference, I think if you read it all  and I know that you have  you will find that Secretary Dulles also indicated in that press conference that when the troops were withdrawn from Quemoy, that the implication was certainly of everything that he said, that Quemoy could better be defended. There were too many infantrymen there, not enough heavy artillery; and certainly I dont think there was any implication in Secretary Dulles statement that Quemoy and Matsu should not be defended in the event that they were attacked, and that attack was a preliminary to an attack on Formosa. Now as far as President Eisenhower is concerned, I have often heard him discuss this question. As I uh  related a moment ago, the President has always indicated that we must not make the mistake in dealing with the dictator of indicating that we are going to make a concession at the point of a gun. Whenever you do that, inevitably the dictator is encouraged to try it again. So first it will be Quemoy and Matsu, next it may be Formosa. What do we do then? My point is this: that once you do this  follow this course of action  of indicating that you are not going to defend a particular area, the inevitable result is that it encourages a man who is determined to conquer the world to press you to the point of no return. And that means war. We went through this tragic experience leading to World War II. We learned our lesson again in Korea, We must not learn it again. That is why I think the Senate was right, including a majority of the Democrats, a majority of the Republicans, when they rejected Senator Kennedys position in 1955. And incidentally, Senator Johnson was among those who rejected that position  voted with the seventy against the twelve. The Senate was right because they knew the lesson of history. And may I say, too, that I would trust that Senator Kennedy would change his position on this  change it; because as long as he as a major presidential candidate continues to suggest that we are going to turn over these islands, he is only encouraging the aggressors  the Chinese Communist and the Soviet aggressors  to press the United States, to press us to the point where war would be inevitable. The road to war is always paved with good intentions. And in this instance the good intentions, of course, are a desire for peace. But certainly were not going to have peace by giving in and indicating in advance that we are not going to defend what has become a symbol of freedom.",1960-10-13,Republican
Mr. Shadel,Senator Kennedy.,1960-10-13,Moderator
Mr. Kennedy,"I dont think its possible for Mr. Nixon to state the record in distortion of the facts with more precision than he just did. In 1955, Mr. Dulles at a press conference said: The treaty that we have with the Republic of China excludes Quemoy and Matsu from the treaty area. That was done with much thought and deliberation. Therefore that treaty does not commit the United States to defend anything except Formosa and the Pescadores, and to deal with acts against that treaty area. I completely sustained the treaty. I voted for it. I would take any action necessary to defend the treaty, Formosa, and the Pescadores Island. What were now talking about is the Vice Presidents determination to guarantee Quemoy and Matsu, which are four and five miles off the coast of Red China, which are not within the treaty area. I do not suggest that Chiang Kai-shek  and this Administration has been attempting since 1955 to persuade Chiang Kai-shek to lessen his troop commitments. Uh  He sent a mission  the President  in 1955 of Mr. uh  Robertson and Admiral Radford. General Twining said they were still doing it in 1959. General Ridgway said  who was Chief of Staff: To go to war for Quemoy and Matsu to me would seem an unwarranted and tragic course to take. To me that concept is completely repugnant. So I stand with them. I stand with the Secretary of State, Mr. Herter, who said these islands were indefensible. I believe that we should meet our commitments, and if the Chinese Communists attack the Pescadores and Formosa, they know that it will mean a war. I would not ho- hand over these islands under any point of gun. But I merely say that the treaty is quite precise and I sustain the treaty. Mr. Nixon would add a guarantee to islands five miles off the coast of the re- Republic of China when hes never really protested the Communists seizing Cuba, ninety miles off the coast of the United States.",1960-10-13,Democrat
Mr. Shadel,Mr. Von Fremd has a question for Senator Kennedy.,1960-10-13,Moderator
Mr. Von Fremd,"Senator Kennedy, Id like to uh  shift the conversation, if I may, to a domestic uh  political argument. The chairman of the Republican National Committee, Senator Thruston Morton, declared earlier this week that you owed Vice President Nixon and the Republican party a public apology for some strong charges made by former President Harry Truman, who bluntly suggested where the Vice President and the Republican party could go. Do you feel that you owe the Vice President an apology?",1960-10-13,Moderator
Mr. Kennedy,"Well, I must say that uh  Mr. Truman has uh  his methods of expressing things; hes been in politics for fifty years; hes been president of the United States. They may  are not my style. But I really dont think theres anything that I could say to President Truman thats going to cause him, at the age of seventy-six, to change his particular speaking manner. Perhaps Mrs. Truman can, but I dont think I can. Ill just have to tell Mr. Morton that. If youd pass that message on to him.",1960-10-13,Democrat
Mr. Shadel,"Any comment, Mr. Vice President?",1960-10-13,Moderator
Mr. Nixon,"Yes, I think so. Of course, both er  Senator Kennedy and I have felt Mr. Trumans ire; and uh  consequently, I think he can speak with some feeling on this subject. I just do want to say one thing, however. We all have tempers; I have one; Im sure Senator Kennedy has one. But when a mans president of the United States, or a former president, he has an obligation not to lose his temper in public. One thing Ive noted as Ive traveled around the country are the tremendous number of children who come out to see the presidential candidates. I see mothers holding their babies up, so that they can see a man who might be president of the United States. I know Senator Kennedy sees them, too. It makes you realize that whoever is president is going to be a man that all the children of America will either look up to, or will look down to. And I can only say that Im very proud that President Eisenhower restored dignity and decency and, frankly, good language to the conduct of the presidency of the United States. And I only hope that, should I win this election, that I could approach President Eisenhower in maintaining the dignity of the office; in seeing to it that whenever any mother or father talks to his child, he can look at the man in the White House and, whatever he may think of his policies, he will say: Well, there is a man who maintains the kind of standards personally that I would want my child to follow.",1960-10-13,Republican
Mr. Shadel,Mr. Caters question is for Vice President Nixon.,1960-10-13,Moderator
Mr. Cater,"Mr. Vice President, Id like to return just once more, if I may, to this area of dealing with the Communists. Critics have claimed that on at least three occasions in recent years  on the sending of American troops to Indochina in 1954, on the matter of continuing the U-2 flights uh  in May, and then on this definition of the  of our commitment to the offshore island  that you have overstated the Administration position, that you have taken a more bellicose position than President Eisenhower. Just two days ago you said that you called on uh  Senator Kennedy to serve notice to Communist aggressors around the world that were not going to retreat one inch more any place, where as we did retreat from the Tachen Islands, or at least Chiang Kai-shek did. Would you say this was a valid criticism of your statement of foreign policy?",1960-10-13,Moderator
Mr. Nixon,"Well, Mr. Cater, of course its a criticism that uh  is being made. Uh  I obviously dont think its valid. I have supported the Administrations position and I think that that position has been correct; I think my position has been correct. As far as Indochina was concerned, I stated over and over again that it was essential during that period that the United States make it clear that we would not tolerate Indochina falling under Communist domination. Now, as a result of our taking the strong stand that we did, the civil war there was ended; and today, at least in the south of Indochina, the Communists have moved out and we do have a strong, free bastion there. Now, looking to the U-2 flights, I would like to point out that I have been supporting the Presidents position throughout. I think the President was correct in ordering these flights. I think the President was correct, certainly, in his decision to continue the flights while the conference was going on. I noted, for example, in reading a  uh  a  a particular discussion that Senator Kennedy had with Dave Garroway shortly after the uh  his statement about regrets, that uh  he made the statement that he felt that these particular flights uh  were ones that shouldnt have occurred right at that time, and the indication was how would Mr. Khrushchev had felt if we had uh  had a flight over the uni- how would we have felt if Mr. Khrushchev ha  uh  had a flight over the United States while uh  he was visiting here. And the answer, of course, is that Communist espionage goes on all the time. The answer is that the United States cant afford to have a es- an es  a espionage lack or should we s- uh  lag  or should I say uh  an intelligence lag  any more than we can afford to have a missile lag. Now, referring to your question with regard to Quemoy and Matsu. What I object to here is the constant reference to surrendering these islands. Senator Kennedy quotes the record, which he read from a moment ago, but what he forgets to point out is that the key vote  a uh  vote which Ive referred to several times  where he was in the minority was one which rejected his position. Now, why did they reject it? For the very reason that those Senators knew, as the President of the United States knew, that you should not indicate to the Communists in advance that youre going to surrender an area thats free. Why? Because they know as Senator Kennedy will have to know that if you do that you encourage them to more aggression.",1960-10-13,Republican
Mr. Shadel,Senator Kennedy?,1960-10-13,Moderator
Mr. Kennedy,"Well number one on Indochina, Mr. Nixon talked in  before the newspaper editors in the spring of 1954 about putting, and I quote him, American boys into Indochina. The reason Indochina was preserved was the result of the Geneva Conference which Indochina. Number two, on the question of the U-2 flights. I thought the. U-2 flight in May just before the conference was a mistake in timing because of the hazards involved, if the summit conference had any hope for success. I never criticized the U-2 flights in general, however. I never suggested espionage should stop. It still goes on, I would assume, on both sides. Number three, the Vice President  on May fifteenth after the U-2 flight  indicated that the flights were going on, even though the Administration and the President had canceled the flights on May twelfth. Number three, the pre  Vice President suggests that we should keep the Communists in doubt about whether we would fight on Quemoy and Matsu. Thats not the position hes taking. Hes indicating that we should fight for these islands come what may because they are, in his words, in the area of freedom. He didnt take that position on Tibet. He didnt take that position on Budapest. He doesnt take that position that Ive seen so far in Laos. Guinea and Ghana have both moved within the Soviet sphere of influence in foreign policy; so has Cuba. I merely say that the United States should meet its commitments to Que- to uh  Formosa and the Pescadores. But as Admiral Yarnell has said, and hes been supported by most military authority, these islands that were now talking about are not worth the bones of a single American soldier; and I know how difficult it is to sustain troops close to the shore under artillery bombardment. And therefore, I think, we should make it very clear the disagreement between Mr. Nixon and myself. Hes extending the Administrations commitment.",1960-10-13,Democrat
Mr. Shadel,Mr. Drummonds question is for Senator Kennedy.,1960-10-13,Moderator
Mr. Drummond,"Uh  Mr. Kennedy, Representative Adam Clayton Powell, in the course of his speaking tour in your behalf, is saying, and I quote: The Ku Klux Klan is riding again in this campaign. If it doesnt stop, all bigots will vote for Nixon and all right-thinking Christians and Jews will vote for Kennedy rather than be found in the ranks of the Klan-minded. End quotation. Governor Michael DiSalle is saying much the same thing. What I would like to ask, Senator Kennedy, is what is the purpose of this sort of thing and how do you feel about it?",1960-10-13,Moderator
Mr. Kennedy,"Well the que- the  Mr. Griffin, I believe, who is the head of the Klan, who lives in Tampa, Florida, indicated a  in a statement, I think, two or three weeks ago that he was not going to vote for me, and that he was going to vote for Mr. Nixon. I do not suggest in any way, nor have I ever, that that indicates that Mr. Nixon has the slightest sympathy, involvement, or in any way imply any inferences in regard to the Ku Klux Klan. Thats absurd. I dont suggest that, I dont support it. I would disagree with it. Mr. Nixon knows very well that in this  in this whole matter thats been involved with the so-called religious discussion in this campaign, Ive never suggested, even by the vaguest implication, that he did anything but disapprove it. And thats my view now. I disapprove of the issue. I do not suggest that Mr. Nixon does in any way.",1960-10-13,Democrat
Mr. Shadel,Mr. Vice President.,1960-10-13,Moderator
Mr. Nixon,"Well I welcome this opportunity to join Senator Kennedy completely on that statement and to say before this largest television audience in history something that I have been saying in the past and want to  will always say in the future. On our last television debate, I pointed out that it was my position that Americans must choose the best man that either party could produce. We cant settle for anything but the best. And that means, of course, the best man that this nation can produce. And that means that we cant have any test of religion. We cant have any test of race. It must be a test of a man. Also as far as religion is concerned. I have seen Communism abroad. I see what it does. Communism is the enemy of all religions; and we who do believe in God must join together. We must not be divided on this issue. The worst thing that I can think can happen in this campaign would be for it to be decided on religious issues. I obviously repudiate the Klan; I repudiate anybody who uses the religious issue; I will not tolerate it, I have ordered all of my people to have nothing to do with it and I say  say to this great audience, whoever may be listening, remember, if you believe in America, if you want America to set the right example to the world, that we cannot have religious or racial prejudice. We cannot have it in our hearts. But we certainly cannot have it in a presidential campaign.",1960-10-13,Republican
Mr. Shadel,Mr. McGee has a question for Vice President Nixon.,1960-10-13,Moderator
Mr. Mcgee,"Mr. Vice President, some of your early campaign literature said you were making a study to see if new laws were needed to protect the public against excessive use of power by labor unions. Have you decided whether such new laws are needed, and, if so, what would they do?",1960-10-13,Moderator
Mr. Nixon,"Mr. McGee, I am planning a speech on that subject next week. Uh  Also, so that we can get the uh  opportunity for the questioners to question me, it will be before the next television debate. Uh  I will say simply, in advance of it, that I believe that in this area, the laws which should be passed uh  as far as the big national emergency strikes are concerned, are ones that will give the president more weapons with which to deal with those strikes. Now, I have a basic disagreement with Senator Kennedy, though, on this point. He has taken the position, when he first indicated in October of last year, that he would even favor compulsory arbitration as one of the weapons the president might have to stop a national emergency strike. I understand in his last speech before the Steelworkers Union, that he changed that position and indicated that he felt that government seizure might be the best way to stop a strike which could not be settled by collective bargaining. I do not believe we should have either compulsory arbitration or seizure. I think the moment that you give to the union, on the one side, and to management, on the other side, the escape hatch of eventually going to government to get it settled, that most of these great strikes will end up being settled by government, and that will be a  be in the end, in my opinion, wage control; it would mean price control  all the things that we do not want. I do believe, however, that we can give to the president of the United States powers, in addition to what he presently has in the fact finding area, which would enable him to be more effective than we have been in handling these strikes. One last point I should make. The record in handling them has been very good during this Administration. We have had less man-hours lost by strikes in these last seven years than we had in the previous seven years, by a great deal. And I only want to say that however good the record is, its got to be better. Because in this critical year  period of the sixties weve got to move forward, all Americans must move forward together, and we have to get the greatest cooperation possible between labor and management. We cannot afford stoppages of massive effect on the economy when were in the terrible competition were in with the Soviets.",1960-10-13,Republican
Mr. Shadel,"Senator, your comment.",1960-10-13,Moderator
Mr. Kennedy,"Well, I always have difficulty recognizing my positions when theyre stated by the Vice President. I never suggested that compulsory arbitration was the solution for national emergency disputes. Im opposed to that, was opposed to it in October, 1958. I have suggested that the president should be given other weapons to protect the national interest in case of national emergency strikes beyond the injunction provision of the Taft-Hartley Act. I dont know what other weapons the Vice President is talking about. Im talking about giving him four or five tools  not only the fact-finding committee that he now has under the injunction provision, not only the injunction, but also the power of the fact-finding commission to make recommendations  recommendations which would not be binding, but nevertheless would have great force of public opinion behind them. One of the additional powers that I would suggest would be seizure. There might be others. By the president having five powers  four or five powers  and he only has very limited powers today, neither the company nor the union would be sure which power would be used; and therefore, there would be a greater incentive on both sides to reach an agreement themselves without taking it to the government. The difficulty now is the presidents course is quite limited. He can set up a fact-finding committee. The fact-finding committees powers are limited. He can provide an injunction if theres a national emergency for eighty days, then the strike can go on; and there are no other powers or actions that the president could take unless he went to the Congress. This is a difficult and sensitive matter. But to state my view precisely, the president should have a variety of things he could do. He could leave the parties in doubt as to which one he would use; and therefore there would be incentive, instead of as now  the steel companies were ready to take the strike because they felt the injunction of eighty days would break the union, which didnt happen.",1960-10-13,Democrat
Mr. Shadel,The next question is by Mr. Cater for Senator Kennedy.,1960-10-13,Moderator
Mr. Cater,"Uh  Mr. Kennedy, uh  Senator  uh  Vice President Nixon says that he has costed the two party platforms and that yours would run at least ten billion dollars a year more than his. You have denied his figures. He has called on you to supply your figures. Would you do that?",1960-10-13,Moderator
Mr. Kennedy,"Yes, I have stated in both uh  debates and state again that I believe in a balanced budget and have supported that concept during my fourteen years in the Congress. The only two times when an unbalanced budget is warranted would be during a serious recession  and we had that in fifty-eight in an unbalanced budget of twelve billion dollars  or a national emergency where there should be large expenditures for national defense, which we had in World War II and uh  during part of the Korean War. On the question of the cost of our budget, I have stated that its my best judgment that our agricultural program will cost a billion and a half, possibly two billion dollars less than the present agricultural program. My judgment is that the program the Vice President put forward, which is an extension of Mr. Bensons program, will cost a billion dollars more than the present program, which costs about six billion dollars a year, the most expensive in history. Weve spent more money on agriculture in the last eight years than the hundred years of the Agricultural Department before that. Secondly, I believe that the high interest-rate policy that this Administration has followed has added about three billion dollars a year to interest on the debt  merely funding the debt  which is a burden an the taxpayers. I would hope, under a different monetary policy, that it would be possible to reduce that interest-rate burden, at least a billion dollars. Third, I think its possible to gain a seven hundred million to a billion dollars through tax changes which I believe would close up loof- loopholes on dividend withholding, on expense accounts. Fourthly, I have suggested that the medical care for the aged  and the bill which the Congress now has passed and the President signed if fully implemented would cost a billion dollars on the Treasury  out of Treasury funds and a billion dollars by the states  the proposal that I have put forward and which many of the members of my party support is for medical care financed under Social Security; which would be financed under the Social Security taxes; which is less than three cents a day per person for medical care, doctors bills, nurses, hospitals, when they retire. It is actuarially sound. So in my judgment we would spend more money in this Administration on aid to education, wed spend more money on housing, wed spend more money and I hope more wisely on defense than this Administration has. But I believe that the next Administration should work for a balanced budget, and that would be my intention. Mr. Nixon misstates my figures constantly, which uh  is of course his right, but the fact of the matter is: here is where I stand and I just want to have it on the public record.",1960-10-13,Democrat
Mr. Shadel,Mr. Vice President?,1960-10-13,Moderator
Mr. Nixon,"Senator Kennedy has indicated on several occasions in this program tonight that I have been misstating his record and his figures. I will issue a white paper after this broadcast, quoting exactly what he said on compulsory arbitration, for example, and the record will show that I have been correct. Now as far as his figures are concerned here tonight, he again is engaging in this, what I would call, mirror game of here-it-is-and-here-it-isnt. Uh  On the one hand, for example, he suggests that as far as his medical care program is concerned that that really isnt a problem because its from Social Security. But Social Security is a tax. The people pay it. It comes right out of your paycheck. This doesnt mean that the people arent going to be paying the bill. He also indicates as far as his agricultural program is concerned that he feels it will cost less than ours. Well, all that I can suggest is that all the experts who have studied the program indicate that it is the most fantastic program, the worst program, insofar as its effect on the farmers, that the  America has ever had foisted upon it in an election year or any other time. And I would also point out that Senator Kennedy left out a part of the cost of that program  a twenty-five percent rise in food prices that the people would have to pay. Now are we going to have that when it isnt going to help the farmers? I dont think we should have that kind of a program. Then he goes on to say that hes going to change the interest-rate situation and were going to get some more money that way. Well, what he is saying there in effect, were going to have inflation. Were going to go right back to what we had under Mr. Truman when he had political control of the Federal Reserve Board. I dont believe we ought to pay our bills through inflation, through a phony interest rate.",1960-10-13,Republican
Mr. Shadel,"Next, Mr. Drummonds question for Vice President Nixon.",1960-10-13,Moderator
Mr. Drummond,"Uh  Mr. Nixon uh  before the convention you and Governor Rockefeller said jointly that the nations economic growth ought to be accelerated; and the Republican platform states that uh  the nation needs to quicken the pace of economic growth. Uh  Is it fair, therefore, Mr. Vice President, to conclude that you feel that there has been insufficient economic growth during the past eight years; and if so, what would you do beyond uh  present Administration policies uh  to step it up?",1960-10-13,Moderator
Mr. Nixon,"Mr. Drummond, I am never satisfied with the economic growth of this country. Im not satisfied with it even if there were no Communism in the world, but particularly when were in the kind of a race were in, we have got to see that America grows just as fast as we can, provided we grow soundly. Because even though we have maintained, as I pointed out in our first debate, the absolute gap over the Soviet Union; even though the growth in this Administration has been twice as much as it was in the Truman Administration; that isnt good enough. Because America must be able to grow enough not only to take care of our needs at home for better education and housing and health  all these things we want. Weve got to grow enough to maintain the forces that we have abroad and to wage the non-military battle for the war  uh  for the world in Asia, in Africa and Latin America. Its going to cost more money, and growth will help us to win that battle. Now, what do we do about it? And here I believe basically that what we have to do is to stimulate that sector of America, the private enterprise sector of the economy, in which there is the greatest possibility for expansion. So that is why I advocate a program of tax reform which will stimulate more investment in our economy. In addition to that, we have to move on other areas that are holding back growth. I refer, for example, to distressed areas. We have to move into those areas with programs so that we make adequate use of the resources of those areas. We also have to see that all of the people of the United States  the tremendous talents that our people have  are used adequately. Thats why in this whole area of civil rights, the equality of opportunity for employment and education is not just for the benefit of the minority groups, its for the benefit of the nation so that we can get the scientists and the engineers and all the rest that we need. And in addition to that, we need programs, particularly in higher education, which will stimulate scientific breakthroughs which will bring more growth. Now what all this, of course, adds up to is this: America has not been standing still. Lets get that straight. Anybody who says Americas been standing still for the last seven and a half years hasnt been traveling around America. Hes been traveling in some other country. We have been moving. We have been moving much faster than we did in the Truman years. But we can and must move faster, and thats why I stand so strongly for programs that will move America forward in the sixties, move her forward so that we can stay ahead of the Soviet Union and win the battle for freedom and peace.",1960-10-13,Republican
Mr. Shadel,Senator Kennedy.,1960-10-13,Moderator
Mr. Kennedy,"Well first may I correct a statement which was made before, that under my agricultural program food prices would go up twenty-five percent. Thats untrue. The fa- the farmer who grows wheat gets about two and a half cents out of a twenty-five-cent loaf of bread. Even if you put his income up ten percent, that would be two and three-quarters percent three pers- or three cents out of that twenty-five cents. The t- man who grows tomatoes  it costs less for those tomatoes than it does for the label on the can. And I believe when the average hour for many farmers wage is about fifty cents an hour, he should do better. But anybody who suggests that that program would c- come to any figure indicated by the Vice President is in error. The Vice President suggested a number of things. He suggested that we aid distressed areas. The Administration has vetoed that bill passed by the Congress twice. He suggested we pass an aid to education bill. But the Administration and the Republican majority in the Congress has opposed any realistic aid to education. And the Vice President cast the deciding vote against federal aid for teachers salaries in the Senate, which prevented that being added. This Administration and this country last year had the lowest rate of economic growth  which means jobs  of any major industrialized society in the world in 1959. And when we have to find twenty-five thousand new jobs a week for the next ten years, were going to have to grow more. Governor Rockefeller says five per cent. The Democratic platform and others say five per cent. Many say four and a half per cent. The last eight years the average growth has been about two and a half per cent. Thats why we dont have full employment today.",1960-10-13,Democrat
Mr. Shadel,Mr. McGee has the next question for Senator Kennedy.,1960-10-13,Moderator
Mr. Mcgee,"Uh  Senator Kennedy, a moment ago you mentioned tax loopholes. Now your running mate, Senator Lyndon Johnson, is from Texas, an oil-producing state and one that many political leaders feel is in doubt in this election year. And reports from there say that oil men in Texas are seeking assurance from Senator Johnson that the oil depletion allowance will not be cut. The Democratic platform pledges to plug holes in the tax laws and refers to inequitable depletion allowance as being conspicuous loopholes. My question is, do you consider the twenty-seven and a half per cent depletion allowance inequitable, and would you ask that it be cut?",1960-10-13,Moderator
Mr. Kennedy,"Uh  Mr. McGee, there are about a hundred and four commodities that have some kind of depletion allowance  different kind of minerals, including oil. I believe all of those should be gone over in detail to make sure that no one is getting a tax break; to make sure that no one is getting away from paying the taxes he ought to pay. That includes oil; it includes all kinds of minerals; it includes everything within the range of taxation. We want to be sure its fair and equitable. It includes oil abroad. Perhaps that oil abroad should be treated differently than the oil here at home. Now the oil industry recently has had hard times. Particularly some of the smaller producers. Theyre moving about eight or nine days in Texas. But I can assure you that if Im elected president, the whole spectrum of taxes will be gone through carefully. And if there is any inequities in oil or any other commodity, then I would vote to close that loophole, I have voted in the past to reduce the depletion allowance for the largest producers; for those from five million dollars down, to maintain it at twenty-seven and a half per cent. I believe we should study this and other allowances; tax expense, dividend expenses and all the rest, and make a determination of how we can stimulate growth; how we can provide the revenues needed to move our country forward.",1960-10-13,Democrat
Mr. Shadel,Mr. Vice President.,1960-10-13,Moderator
Mr. Nixon,"Senator Kennedys position and mine completely different on this. I favor the present depletion allowance. I favor it not because I want to make a lot of oil men rich, but because I want to make America rich. Why do we have a depletion allowance? Because this is the stimulation, the incentive for companies to go out and explore for oil, to develop it. If we didnt have a depletion allowance of certainly, I believe, the present amount, we would have our oil exploration cut substantially in this country. Now, as far as my position then is concerned, it is exactly opposite to the Senators. And its because of my belief that if America is going to have the growth that he talks about and that I talk about and that we want, the thing to do is not to discourage individual enterprise, not to discourage people to go out and discover more oil and minerals, but to encourage them. And so he would be doing exactly the wrong thing. One other thing. He suggests that there are a number of other items in this whole depletion field that could be taken into account. He also said a moment ago that we would get more money to finance his programs by revising the tax laws, including depletion. I should point out that as far as depletion allowances are concerned, the oil depletion allowance is one that provides eighty percent of all of those involved in depletion, so youre not going to get much from revenue insofar as depletion allowances are concerned, unless you move in the area that he indicated. But I oppose it. I oppose it for the reasons that I mentioned. I oppose it because I want us to have more oil exploration and not less.",1960-10-13,Republican
Mr. Shadel,"Gentlemen, if I may remind you, time is growing short, so please keep your questions and answers as brief as possible consistent with clarity. Mr. Von Fremd for Vice President Nixon.",1960-10-13,Moderator
Mr. Von Fremd,"Mr. Vice President, in the past three years, there has been an exodus of more than four billion dollars of gold from the United States, apparently for two reasons: because exports have slumped and havent covered imports, and because of increased American investments abroad. If you were president, how would you go about stopping this departure of gold from our shores?",1960-10-13,Moderator
Mr. Nixon,"Well, Mr. Von Fremd, the first thing we have to do is to continue to keep confidence abroad in the American dollar. That means that we must continue to have a balanced budget here at home in every possible circumstance that we can; because the moment that we have loss of confidence in our own fiscal policies at home, it results in gold flowing out. Secondly, we have to increase our exports, as compared with our imports. And here we have a very strong program going forward in the Department of Commerce. This one must be stepped up. Beyond that, as far as the gold supply is concerned, and as far as the movement of gold is concerned, uh  we have to bear in mind that we must get more help from our allies abroad in this great venture in which all free men are involved of winning the battle for freedom. Now America has been carrying a tremendous load in this respect. I think we have been right in carrying it. I have favored our programs abroad for economic assistance and for military assistance. But now we find that the countries of Europe for example, that we have aided, and Japan, that weve aided in the Far East; these countries  some our former enemies, have now recovered completely. They have got to bear a greater share of this load of economic assistance abroad. Thats why I am advocating, and will develop during the course of the next Administration  if, of course, I get the opportunity  a program in which we enlist more aid from these other countries on a concerted basis in the programs of economic development for Africa, Asia and Latin America. The United States cannot continue to carry the major share of this burden by itself. We can a big share of it, but weve got to have more help from our friends abroad; and these three factors, I think, will be very helpful in reversing the gold flow which you spoke about.",1960-10-13,Republican
Mr. Shadel,Senator Kennedy.,1960-10-13,Moderator
Mr. Kennedy,"Just to uh  correct the record, Mr. Nixon said on depletion that his record was the opposite of mine. What I said was that this matter should be thoroughly gone into to make sure that there arent loopholes. If his record is the opposite of that, that means that he doesnt want to go into it. Now on the question of gold. The difficulty, of course, is that we do have heavy obligations abroad, that we therefore have to maintain not only a favorable balance of trade but also send a good deal of our dollars overseas to pay our troops, maintain our bases, and sustain other economies. In other words, if were going to continue to maintain our position in the sixties, we have to maintain a sound monetary and fiscal policy. We have to have control over inflation, and we also have to have a favorable balance of trade. We have to be able to compete in the world market. We have to be able to sell abroad more than we consume uh  from abroad if were going to be able to meet our obligations. In addition, many of the countries around the world still keep restrictions against our goads, going all the way back to the days when there was a dollar shortage. Now there isnt a dollar shortage, and yet many of these countries continue to move against our goods. I believe that we must be able to compete in the market  steel and in all the basic commodities abroad  we must be able to compete against them because we always did because of our technological lead. We have to be sure to maintain that. We have to persuade these other countries not to restrict our goods coming in, not to act as if there was a dollar gap; and third, we have to persuade them to assume some of the responsibilities that up till now weve maintained, to assist underdeveloped countries in Africa, Latin America and Asia make an economic breakthrough on their own.",1960-10-13,Democrat
Mr. Shadel,Mr. Drummonds question now for Senator Kennedy.,1960-10-13,Moderator
Mr. Drummond,"Senator Kennedy, a question on American prestige. In light of the fact that the Soviet Ambassador was recently expelled from the Congo, and that Mr. Khrushchev has this week canceled his trip to Cuba for fear of stirring resentment throughout all Latin America, I would like to ask you to spell out somewhat more fully how you think we should measure American prestige, to determine whether it is rising or whether it is falling.",1960-10-13,Moderator
Mr. Kennedy,"Well, I think there are many uh  tests, Mr. Drummond, of prestige. And the significance of prestige, really, is because were so identified with the cause of freedom. Therefore, if we are on the mount, if we are rising, if our influence is spreading, if our prestige is spreading, then those uh  who stand now on the razor edge of decision between us or between the Communist system, wondering whether they should use the system of freedom to develop their countries or the system of Communism, theyll be persuaded to follow our example. There have been several indications that our prestige is not as high as it once was. Mr. George Allen, the head of our information service, said that a result of our being second in space, in the sputnik in 1957, and I quote him, I believe I paraphrase him accurately. He said that many of these countries equate space developments with scientific productivity and scientific advancement. And therefore, he said, many of these countries now feel that the Soviet Union, which was once so backward, is now on a par with the United States. Secondly, the economic growth of the Soviet Union is greater than ours. Mr. Dulles has suggested its from two to three times as great as ours. This has a great effect on the s- underdeveloped world, which faces problems of low income and high population density and inadequate resources. Three, a Gallup Poll taken in February asked people in ten countries which country they thought would be first in 1970, both scientifically and militarily. And a majority in every country except Greece, felt that it would be the Soviet Union by l970. Four, in the votes at the U.N., particularly the vote dealing with Red China last Saturday, we received the support on the position that we had taken of only two African countries  one, Liberia, which had been tied to us for more than a century, and the other, Union of South Africa, which is not a popular country in Africa. Every other ca- African country either abstained or voted against us. A  More countries voted against us in Asia on this issue than voted with us. On the neutralists resolution, which we were so much opposed to, the same thing happened. The candidate who was a candidate for the president of Brazil, took a trip to Cuba to call on Mr. Castro during the election in order to get the benefit of the Castro supporters uh  within Brazil. There are many indications. Guinea and Ghana, two independent countries within the last three years  Guinea in fifty-seven, Ghana within the last eighteen months  both now are supporting the Soviet foreign policy at the U.N. Mr. Herter said so himself. Laos is moving in that direction. So I would say our prestige is not so high. No longer do we give the image of being on the rise. No longer do we give an image of vitality.",1960-10-13,Democrat
Mr. Shadel,Mr. Vice President.,1960-10-13,Moderator
Mr. Nixon,"Well, I would say first of all that Senators  Kennedys statement that hes just made is not going to help our Gallup Polls abroad and it isnt going to help our prestige either. Lets look at the other side of the coin. Lets look at the vote on the Congo, the vote was seventy to nothing against the Soviet Union. Lets look at the situation with regard to economic growth as it really is. We find that the Soviet Union is a very primitive economy. Its growth rate is not what counts; its whether it is catching up with us and it is not catching up with us. Were well ahead and we can stay ahead, provided we have confidence in America and dont run her down in order to build her up. We could look also at other items which Senator Kennedy has named, but I will only conclude by saying this: in this whole matter of prestige, in the final analysis, its whether you stand for whats right. And getting back to this matter that we discussed at the outset, the matter of Quemoy and Matsu. I can think of nothing that will be a greater blow to the prestige of the United States among the free nations in Asia than for us to take Senator Kennedys advan- advice to go  go against what a majority of the members of the Senate, both Democrat and Republican, did  said in 1955, and to say in advance we will surrender an area to the Communists. In other words, if the United States is going to maintain its strength and its prestige, we must not only be strong militarily and economically, we must be firm diplomatically. Thi- Certainly we have been speaking, I know, of whether we should have retreat or defeat. Lets remember the way to win is not to retreat and not to surrender.",1960-10-13,Republican
Mr. Shadel,"Thank you gentlemen. As we mentioned at the opening of this program, the candidates agreed that the clock alone would determine who had the last word. The two candidates wish to thank the networks for the opportunity to appear for this discussion. I would repeat the ground rules likewise agreed upon by representatives of the two candidates and the radio and television networks. The entire hour was devoted to answering questions from the reporters. Each candidate was questioned in turn and each had the opportunity to comment on the answer of his opponent. The reporters were free to ask any question on any subject. Neither candidate was given any advance information on any question that would be asked. Those were the conditions agreed upon for this third meeting of the candidates tonight. Now I might add that also agreed upon was the fact that when the hour got down to the last few minutes, if there was not sufficient time left for another question and suitable time for answers and comment, the questioning would end at that point. That is the situation at this moment. And after reviewing the rules for this evening I might use the remaining moments of the hour to tell you something about the other arrangements for this debate with the participants a continent apart. I would emphasize first that each candidate was in a studio alone except for three photographers and three reporters of the press and the television technicians. Those studios identical in every detail of lighting, background, physical equipment, even to the paint used in decorating. We newsmen in a third studio have also experienced a somewhat similar isolation. Now, I would remind you the fourth in the series of these historic joint appearances, scheduled for Friday, October twenty-first. At that time the candidates will again share the same platform to discuss foreign policy. This is Bill Shadel. Goodnight.",1960-10-13,Moderator

These debates are sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates. Tonights will last 90 minutes, following detailed rules of engagement worked out by representatives of the candidates. I have agreed to enforce their rules on them. The umbrella topic is foreign policy and homeland security, but the specific subjects were chosen by me, the questions were composed by me, the candidates have not been told what they are, nor has anyone else. For each question there can only be a two-minute response, a 90- second rebuttal and, at my discretion, a discussion extension of one minute. A green light will come on when 30 seconds remain in any given answer, yellow at 15, red at five seconds, and then flashing red means times up. There is also a backup buzzer system if needed. Candidates may not direct a question to each other. There will be two-minute closing statements, but no opening statements.

And I know the president will join me in welcoming all of Florida to this debate. Youve been through the roughest weeks anybody could imagine. Our hearts go out to you. And we admire your pluck and perseverance. I can make American safer than President Bush has made us. And I believe President Bush and I both love our country equally. But we just have a different set of convictions about how you make America safe. I believe America is safest and strongest when we are leading the world and we are leading strong alliances. Ill never give a veto to any country over our security. But I also know how to lead those alliances. This president has left them in shatters across the globe, and were now 90 percent of the casualties in Iraq and 90 percent of the costs. I think thats wrong, and I think we can do better. I have a better plan for homeland security. I have a better plan to be able to fight the war on terror by strengthening our military, strengthening our intelligence, by going after the financing more authoritatively, by doing what we need to do to rebuild the alliances, by reaching out to the Muslim world, which the president has almost not done, and beginning to isolate the radical Islamic Muslims, not have them isolate the United States of America. I know I can do a better job in Iraq. I have a plan to have a summit with all of the allies, something this president has not yet achieved, not yet been able to do to bring people to the table. We can do a better job of training the Iraqi forces to defend themselves, and I know that we can do a better job of preparing for elections.

And since that day, our nation has been on a multi-pronged strategy to keep our country safer. We pursued Al Qaida wherever Al Qaida tries to hide. Seventy-five percent of known Al Qaida leaders have been brought to justice. The rest of them know were after them. Weve upheld the doctrine that said if you harbor a terrorist, youre equally as guilty as the terrorist. And the Taliban are no longer in power. Ten million people have registered to vote in Afghanistan in the upcoming presidential election. In Iraq, we saw a threat, and we realized that after September the 11th, we must take threats seriously, before they fully materialize. Saddam Hussein now sits in a prison cell. America and the world are safer for it. We continue to pursue our policy of disrupting those who proliferate weapons of mass destruction. Libya has disarmed. The A.Q. Khan network has been brought to justice. And, as well, were pursuing a strategy of freedom around the world, because I understand free nations will reject terror.

I have  I understand everybody in this country doesnt agree with the decisions Ive made. And I made some tough decisions. But people know where I stand. People out there listening know what I believe. And thats how best it is to keep the peace. This nation of ours has got a solemn duty to defeat this ideology of hate. And thats what they are. This is a group of killers who will not only kill here, but kill children in Russia, thatll attack unmercifully in Iraq, hoping to shake our will. We have a duty to defeat this enemy. We have a duty to protect our children and grandchildren. The best way to defeat them is to never waver, to be strong, to use every asset at our disposal, is to constantly stay on the offensive and, at the same time, spread liberty. And thats what people are seeing now is happening in Afghanistan. Ten million citizens have registered to vote. Its a phenomenal statistic. That if given a chance to be free, they will show up at the polls. Forty-one percent of those 10 million are women. In Iraq, no doubt about it, its tough. Its hard work. Its incredibly hard. You know why? Because an enemy realizes the stakes. The enemy understands a free Iraq will be a major defeat in their ideology of hatred. Thats why theyre fighting so vociferously. They showed up in Afghanistan when they were there, because they tried to beat us and they didnt. And theyre showing up in Iraq for the same reason. Theyre trying to defeat us.

This president has made, I regret to say, a colossal error of judgment. And judgment is what we look for in the president of the United States of America. Im proud that important military figures who are supporting me in this race: former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff John Shalikashvili; just yesterday, General Eisenhowers son, General John Eisenhower, endorsed me; General Admiral William Crown; General Tony McBeak, who ran the Air Force war so effectively for his father  all believe I would make a stronger commander in chief. And they believe it because they know I would not take my eye off of the goal: Osama bin Laden. Unfortunately, he escaped in the mountains of Tora Bora. We had him surrounded. But we didnt use American forces, the best trained in the world, to go kill him. The president relied on Afghan warlords and he outsourced that job too. Thats wrong.",2004-09-30,Democrat

Kerry,"Well, where do you want me to begin? First of all, he made the misjudgment of saying to America that he was going to build a true alliance, that he would exhaust the remedies of the United Nations and go through the inspections. In fact, he first didnt even want to do that. And it wasnt until former Secretary of State Jim Baker and General Scowcroft and others pushed publicly and said youve got to go to the U.N., that the president finally changed his mind  his campaign has a word for that  and went to the United Nations. Now, once there, we could have continued those inspections. We had Saddam Hussein trapped. He also promised America that he would go to war as a last resort. Those words mean something to me, as somebody who has been in combat. Last resort. Youve got to be able to look in the eyes of families and say to those parents, I tried to do everything in my power to prevent the loss of your son and daughter. I dont believe the United States did that. And we pushed our allies aside. And so, today, we are 90 percent of the casualties and 90 percent of the cost: $200 billion  $200 billion that could have been used for health care, for schools, for construction, for prescription drugs for seniors, and its in Iraq. And Iraq is not even the center of the focus of the war on terror. The center is Afghanistan, where, incidentally, there were more Americans killed last year than the year before; where the opium production is 75 percent of the worlds opium production; where 40 to 60 percent of the economy of Afghanistan is based on opium; where the elections have been postponed three times. The president moved the troops, so hes got 10 times the number of troops in Iraq than he has in Afghanistan, where Osama bin Laden is. Does that mean that Saddam Hussein was 10 times more important than Osama bin Laden  than, excuse me, Saddam Hussein more important than Osama bin Laden? I dont think so.",2004-09-30,Democrat

Bush,"My opponent looked at the same intelligence I looked at and declared in 2002 that Saddam Hussein was a grave threat. He also said in December of 2003 that anyone who doubts that the world is safer without Saddam Hussein does not have the judgment to be president. I agree with him. The world is better off without Saddam Hussein. I was hoping diplomacy would work. I understand the serious consequences of committing our troops into harms way. Its the hardest decision a president makes. So I went to the United Nations. I didnt need anybody to tell me to go to the United Nations. I decided to go there myself. And I went there hoping that, once and for all, the free world would act in concert to get Saddam Hussein to listen to our demands. They passed the resolution that said, Disclose, disarm, or face serious consequences. I believe, when an international body speaks, it must mean what it says. Saddam Hussein had no intention of disarming. Why should he? He had 16 other resolutions and nothing took place. As a matter of fact, my opponent talks about inspectors. The facts are that he was systematically deceiving the inspectors. That wasnt going to work. Thats kind of a pre-September 10th mentality, the hope that somehow resolutions and failed inspections would make this world a more peaceful place. He was hoping wed turn away. But there was fortunately others beside myself who believed that we ought to take action. We did. The world is safer without Saddam Hussein.",2004-09-30,Republican

Bush,"Jim, weve got the capability of doing both. As a matter of fact, this is a global effort. Were facing a group of folks who have such hatred in their heart, theyll strike anywhere, with any means. And thats why its essential that we have strong alliances, and we do. Thats why its essential that we make sure that we keep weapons of mass destruction out of the hands of people like Al Qaida, which we are. But to say that theres only one focus on the war on terror doesnt really understand the nature of the war on terror. Of course were after Saddam Hussein  I mean bin Laden. Hes isolated. Seventy-five percent of his people have been brought to justice. The killer  the mastermind of the September 11th attacks, Khalid Sheik Mohammed, is in prison. Were making progress. But the front on this war is more than just one place. The Philippines  weve got help  were helping them there to bring  to bring Al Qaida affiliates to justice there. And, of course, Iraq is a central part in the war on terror. Thats why Zarqawi and his people are trying to fight us. Their hope is that we grow weary and we leave. The biggest disaster that could happen is that we not succeed in Iraq. We will succeed. Weve got a plan to do so. And the main reason well succeed is because the Iraqis want to be free. I had the honor of visiting with Prime Minister Allawi. Hes a strong, courageous leader. He believes in the freedom of the Iraqi people. He doesnt want U.S. leadership, however, to send mixed signals, to not stand with the Iraqi people. He believes, like I believe, that the Iraqis are ready to fight for their own freedom. They just need the help to be trained. There will be elections in January. Were spending reconstruction money. And our alliance is strong. Thats the plan for victory.

The president made the judgment to divert forces from under General Tommy Franks from Afghanistan before the Congress even approved it to begin to prepare to go to war in Iraq. And he rushed the war in Iraq without a plan to win the peace. Now, that is not the judgment that a president of the United States ought to make. You dont take America to war unless have the plan to win the peace. You dont send troops to war without the body armor that they need. Ive met kids in Ohio, parents in Wisconsin places, Iowa, where theyre going out on the Internet to get the state-of-the-art body gear to send to their kids. Some of them got it for a birthday present. I think thats wrong. Humvees  10,000 out of 12,000 Humvees that are over there arent armored. And you go visit some of those kids in the hospitals today who were maimed because they dont have the armament. This president just  I dont know if he sees whats really happened over there. But its getting worse by the day. More soldiers killed in June than before. More in July than June. More in August than July. More in September than in August. And now we see beheadings.

Kerry,"Jim, let me tell you exactly what Ill do. And there are a long list of thing. First of all, what kind of mixed message does it send when you have $500 million going over to Iraq to put police officers in the streets of Iraq, and the president is cutting the COPS program in America? What kind of message does it send to be sending money to open firehouses in Iraq, but were shutting firehouses who are the first- responders here in America. The president hasnt put one nickel, not one nickel into the effort to fix some of our tunnels and bridges and most exposed subway systems. Thats why they had to close down the subway in New York when the Republican Convention was there. We hadnt done the work that ought to be done. The president  95 percent of the containers that come into the ports, right here in Florida, are not inspected. Civilians get onto aircraft, and their luggage is X-rayed, but the cargo hold is not X- rayed. This president thought it was more important to give the wealthiest people in America a tax cut rather than invest in homeland security. Those arent my values. I believe in protecting America first. And long before President Bush and I get a tax cut  and thats who gets it  long before we do, Im going to invest in homeland security and Im going to make sure were not cutting COPS programs in America and were fully staffed in our firehouses and that we protect the nuclear and chemical plants. The president also unfortunately gave in to the chemical industry, which didnt want to do some of the things necessary to strengthen our chemical plant exposure. And theres an enormous undone job to protect the loose nuclear materials in the world that are able to get to terrorists. Thats a whole other subject, but I see we still have a little bit more time. Let me just quickly say, at the current pace, the president will not secure the loose material in the Soviet Union  former Soviet Union for 13 years. Im going to do it in four years. And were going to keep it out of the hands of terrorists.",2004-09-30,Democrat
Lehrer,"Ninety-second response, Mr. President.",2004-09-30,Moderator
Bush,"I dont think we want to get to how hes going to pay for all these promises. Its like a huge tax gap. Anyway, thats for another debate. My administration has tripled the amount of money were spending on homeland security to $30 billion a year. My administration worked with the Congress to create the Department of Homeland Security so we could better coordinate our borders and ports. Weve got 1,000 extra border patrol on the southern border; want 1,000 on the northern border. Were modernizing our borders. We spent $3.1 billion for fire and police, $3.1 billion. Were doing our duty to provide the funding. But the best way to protect this homeland is to stay on the offense. You know, we have to be right 100 percent of the time. And the enemy only has to be right once to hurt us. Theres a lot of good people working hard. And by the way, weve also changed the culture of the FBI to have counterterrorism as its number one priority. Were communicating better. Were going to reform our intelligence services to make sure that we get the best intelligence possible. The Patriot Act is vital  is vital that the Congress renew the Patriot Act which enables our law enforcement to disrupt terror cells. But again, I repeat to my fellow citizens, the best way to protection is to stay on the offense.",2004-09-30,Republican

Bush,"Let me first tell you that the best way for Iraq to be safe and secure is for Iraqi citizens to be trained to do the job. And thats what were doing. Weve got 100,000 trained now, 125,000 by the end of this year, 200,000 by the end of next year. That is the best way. Well never succeed in Iraq if the Iraqi citizens do not want to take matters into their own hands to protect themselves. I believe they want to. Prime Minister Allawi believes they want to. And so the best indication about when we can bring our troops home  which I really want to do, but I dont want to do so for the sake of bringing them home; I want to do so because weve achieved an objective  is to see the Iraqis perform and to see the Iraqis step up and take responsibility. And so, the answer to your question is: When our general is on the ground and Ambassador Negroponte tells me that Iraq is ready to defend herself from these terrorists, that elections will have been held by then, that their stability and that theyre on their way to, you know, a nation thats free; thats when. And I hope its as soon as possible. But I know putting artificial deadlines wont work. My opponent at one time said, Well, get me elected, Ill have them out of there in six months. You cant do that and expect to win the war on terror. My message to our troops is, Thank you for what youre doing. Were standing with you strong. Well give you all the equipment you need. And well get you home as soon as the missions done, because this is a vital mission. A free Iraq will be an ally in the war on terror, and thats essential. A free Iraq will set a powerful example in the part of the world that is desperate for freedom. A free Iraq will help secure Israel. A free Iraq will enforce the hopes and aspirations of the reformers in places like Iran. A free Iraq is essential for the security of this country.",2004-09-30,Republican

And they both looked at me and said: We need you. Youve got to help us over there. Now I believe theres a better way to do this. You know, the presidents father did not go into Iraq, into Baghdad, beyond Basra. And the reason he didnt is, he said  he wrote in his book  because there was no viable exit strategy. And he said our troops would be occupiers in a bitterly hostile land. Thats exactly where we find ourselves today. Theres a sense of American occupation. The only building that was guarded when the troops when into Baghdad was the oil ministry. We didnt guard the nuclear facilities. We didnt guard the foreign office, where you might have found information about weapons of mass destruction. We didnt guard the borders. Almost every step of the way, our troops have been left on these extraordinarily difficult missions. I know what its like to go out on one of those missions when you dont know whats around the corner. And I believe our troops need other allies helping. Im going to hold that summit.

And from the beginning, I did vote to give the authority, because I thought Saddam Hussein was a threat, and I did accept that intelligence. But I also laid out a very strict series of things we needed to do in order to proceed from a position of strength. Then the president, in fact, promised them. He went to Cincinnati and he gave a speech in which he said, We will plan carefully. We will proceed cautiously. We will not make war inevitable. We will go with our allies. He didnt do any of those things. They didnt do the planning. They left the planning of the State Department in the State Department desks. They avoided even the advice of their own general. General Shinsheki, the Army chief of staff, said youre going to need several hundred thousand troops. Instead of listening to him, they retired him. The terrorism czar, who has worked for every president since Ronald Reagan, said, Invading Iraq in response to 9/11 would be like Franklin Roosevelt invading Mexico in response to Pearl Harbor. Thats what we have here. And what we need now is a president who understands how to bring these other countries together to recognize their stakes in this. They do have stakes in it. Theyve always had stakes in it. The Arab countries have a stake in not having a civil war. The European countries have a stake in not having total disorder on their doorstep. But this president hasnt even held the kind of statesman-like summits that pull people together and get them to invest in those states. In fact, hes done the opposite. He pushed them away. When the Secretary General Kofi Annan offered the United Nations, he said, No, no, well go do this alone. To save for Halliburton the spoils of the war, they actually issued a memorandum from the Defense Department saying, If you werent with us in the war, dont bother applying for any construction.

But you cant tell me that when the most troops any other country has on the ground is Great Britain, with 8,300, and below that the four others are below 4,000, and below that, there isnt anybody out of the hundreds, that we have a genuine coalition to get this job done. You cant tell me that on the day that we went into that war and it started  it was principally the United States, the America and Great Britain and one or two others. Thats it.

We know that he promised America that he was going to build this coalition. I just described the coalition. It is not the kind of coalition we were described when we were talking about voting for this. The president said he would exhaust the remedies of the United Nations and go through that full process. He didnt. He cut if off, sort of arbitrarily. And we know that there were further diplomatic efforts under way. They just decided the time for diplomacy is over and rushed to war without planning for what happens afterwards. Now, he misled the American people in his speech when he said we will plan carefully. They obviously didnt. He misled the American people when he said wed go to war as a last resort. We did not go as a last resort. And most Americans know the difference.

Ive worked with those leaders the president talks about, Ive worked with them for 20 years, for longer than this president.

We need to be smarter about now we wage a war on terror. We need to deny them the recruits. We need to deny them the safe havens. We need to rebuild our alliances.

Kerry,"The time line that Ive set out  and again, I want to correct the president, because hes misled again this evening on what Ive said. I didnt say I would bring troops out in six months. I said, if we do the things that Ive set out and we are successful, we could begin to draw the troops down in six months. And I think a critical component of success in Iraq is being able to convince the Iraqis and the Arab world that the United States doesnt have long-term designs on it. As I understand it, were building some 14 military bases there now, and some people say theyve got a rather permanent concept to them. When you guard the oil ministry, but you dont guard the nuclear facilities, the message to a lot of people is maybe, Wow, maybe theyre interested in our oil. Now, the problem is that they didnt think these things through properly. And these are the things you have to think through. What I want to do is change the dynamics on the ground. And you have to do that by beginning to not back off of the Fallujahs and other places, and send the wrong message to the terrorists. You have to close the borders. Youve got to show youre serious in that regard. But youve also got to show that you are prepared to bring the rest of the world in and share the stakes. I will make a flat statement: The United States of America has no long-term designs on staying in Iraq. And our goal in my administration would be to get all of the troops out of there with a minimal amount you need for training and logistics as we do in some other countries in the world after a war to be able to sustain the peace. But thats how were going to win the peace, by rapidly training the Iraqis themselves.

Well, Prime Minister Allawi was here. He is the leader of that country. Hes a brave, brave man. When he came, after giving a speech to the Congress, my opponent questioned his credibility. You cant change the dynamics on the ground if youve criticized the brave leader of Iraq. One of his campaign people alleged that Prime Minister Allawi was like a puppet. Thats no way to treat somebody whos courageous and brave, that is trying to lead his country forward. The way to make sure that we succeed is to send consistent, sound messages to the Iraqi people that when we give our word, we will keep our word, that we stand with you, that we believe you want to be free. And I do. I believe that 25 million people, the vast majority, long to have elections.

Bush,"I would hope I never have to. I understand how hard it is to commit troops. Never wanted to commit troops. When I was running  when we had the debate in 2000, never dreamt Id be doing that. But the enemy attacked us, Jim, and I have a solemn duty to protect the American people, to do everything I can to protect us. I think that by speaking clearly and doing what we say and not sending mixed messages, it is less likely well ever have to use troops. But a president must always be willing to use troops. It must  as a last resort. I was hopeful diplomacy would work in Iraq. It was falling apart. There was no doubt in my mind that Saddam Hussein was hoping that the world would turn a blind eye. And if he had been in power, in other words, if we would have said, Let the inspectors work, or lets, you know, hope to talk him out. Maybe an 18th resolution would work, he would have been stronger and tougher, and the world would have been a lot worse off. Theres just no doubt in my mind we would rue the day, had Saddam Hussein been in power. So we use diplomacy every chance we get, believe me. And I would hope to never have to use force. But by speaking clearly and sending messages that we mean what we say, weve affected the world in a positive way. Look at Libya. Libya was a threat. Libya is now peacefully dismantling its weapons programs. Libya understood that America and others will enforce doctrine and that the world is better for it. So to answer your question, I would hope we never have to. I think by acting firmly and decisively, it will mean it is less likely we have to use force.",2004-09-30,Republican

Kerry,"Jim, the president just said something extraordinarily revealing and frankly very important in this debate. In answer to your question about Iraq and sending people into Iraq, he just said, The enemy attacked us. Saddam Hussein didnt attack us. Osama bin Laden attacked us. Al Qaida attacked us. And when we had Osama bin Laden cornered in the mountains of Tora Bora, 1,000 of his cohorts with him in those mountains. With the American military forces nearby and in the field, we didnt use the best trained troops in the world to go kill the worlds number one criminal and terrorist. They outsourced the job to Afghan warlords, who only a week earlier had been on the other side fighting against us, neither of whom trusted each other. Thats the enemy that attacked us. Thats the enemy that was allowed to walk out of those mountains. Thats the enemy that is now in 60 countries, with stronger recruits. He also said Saddam Hussein would have been stronger. That is just factually incorrect. Two-thirds of the country was a no-fly zone when we started this war. We would have had sanctions. We would have had the U.N. inspectors. Saddam Hussein would have been continually weakening. If the president had shown the patience to go through another round of resolution, to sit down with those leaders, say, What do you need, what do you need now, how much more will it take to get you to join us? wed be in a stronger place today.",2004-09-30,Democrat

Iran is moving toward nuclear weapons and the world is more dangerous. Darfur has a genocide. The world is more dangerous. Id have made a better choice.",2004-09-30,Democrat
Lehrer,"New question. Two minutes, Senator Kerry. What is your position on the whole concept of preemptive war? KERRY: The president always has the right, and always has had the right, for preemptive strike. That was a great doctrine throughout the Cold War. And it was always one of the things we argued about with respect to arms control. No president, through all of American history, has ever ceded, and nor would I, the right to preempt in any way necessary to protect the United States of America. But if and when you do it, Jim, you have to do it in a way that passes the test, that passes the global test where your countrymen, your people understand fully why youre doing what youre doing and you can prove to the world that you did it for legitimate reasons. Here we have our own secretary of state who has had to apologize to the world for the presentation he made to the United Nations. I mean, we can remember when President Kennedy in the Cuban missile crisis sent his secretary of state to Paris to meet with DeGaulle. And in the middle of the discussion, to tell them about the missiles in Cuba, he said, Here, let me show you the photos. And DeGaulle waved them off and said, No, no, no, no. The word of the president of the United States is good enough for me. How many leaders in the world today would respond to us, as a result of what weve done, in that way? So what is at test here is the credibility of the United States of America and how we lead the world. And Iran and Iraq are now more dangerous  Iran and North Korea are now more dangerous. Now, whether preemption is ultimately what has to happen, I dont know yet. But Ill tell you this: As president, Ill never take my eye off that ball. Ive been fighting for proliferation the entire time  anti-proliferation the entire time Ive been in the Congress. And weve watched this president actually turn away from some of the treaties that were on the table. You dont help yourself with other nations when you turn away from the global warming treaty, for instance, or when you refuse to deal at length with the United Nations. You have to earn that respect. And I think we have a lot of earning back to do.",2004-09-30,Moderator

Let me tell you one thing I didnt sign, and I think it shows the difference of our opinion  the difference of opinions. And that is, I wouldnt join the International Criminal Court. This is a body based in The Hague where unaccountable judges and prosecutors can pull our troops or diplomats up for trial. And I wouldnt join it. And I understand that in certain capitals around the world that that wasnt a popular move. But its the right move not to join a foreign court that could  where our people could be prosecuted. My opponent is for joining the International Criminal Court. I just think trying to be popular, kind of, in the global sense, if its not in our best interest makes no sense.

Bush,"North Korea, first, I do. Let me say  I certainly hope so. Before I was sworn in, the policy of this government was to have bilateral negotiations with North Korea. And we signed an agreement with North Korea that my administration found out that was not being honored by the North Koreans. And so I decided that a better way to approach the issue was to get other nations involved, just besides us. And in Crawford, Texas, Jiang Zemin and I agreed that the nuclear-weapons-free peninsula, Korean Peninsula, was in his interest and our interest and the worlds interest. And so we began a new dialogue with North Korea, one that included not only the United States, but now China. And Chinas a got a lot of influence over North Korea, some ways more than we do. As well, we included South Korea, Japan and Russia. So now there are five voices speaking to Kim Jong Il, not just one. And so if Kim Jong Il decides again to not honor an agreement, hes not only doing injustice to America, hed be doing injustice to China, as well. And I think this will work. Its not going to work if we open up a dialogue with Kim Jong Il. Thats what he wants. He wants to unravel the six- party talks, or the five-nation coalition thats sending him a clear message. On Iran, I hope we can do the same thing, continue to work with the world to convince the Iranian mullahs to abandon their nuclear ambitions. We worked very closely with the foreign ministers of France, Germany and Great Britain, who have been the folks delivering the message to the mullahs that if you expect to be part of the world of nations, get rid of your nuclear programs. The IAEA is involved. Theres a special protocol recently been passed that allows for inspections. I hope we can do it. And weve got a good strategy.",2004-09-30,Republican

Kerry,"With respect to Iran, the British, French, and Germans were the ones who initiated an effort without the United States, regrettably, to begin to try to move to curb the nuclear possibilities in Iran. I believe we could have done better. I think the United States should have offered the opportunity to provide the nuclear fuel, test them, see whether or not they were actually looking for it for peaceful purposes. If they werent willing to work a deal, then we could have put sanctions together. The president did nothing. With respect to North Korea, the real story: We had inspectors and television cameras in the nuclear reactor in North Korea. Secretary Bill Perry negotiated that under President Clinton. And we knew where the fuel rods were. And we knew the limits on their nuclear power. Colin Powell, our secretary of state, announced one day that we were going to continue the dialog of working with the North Koreans. The president reversed it publicly while the president of South Korea was here. And the president of South Korea went back to South Korea bewildered and embarrassed because it went against his policy. And for two years, this administration didnt talk at all to North Korea. While they didnt talk at all, the fuel rods came out, the inspectors were kicked out, the television cameras were kicked out. And today, there are four to seven nuclear weapons in the hands of North Korea. That happened on this presidents watch. Now, that, I think, is one of the most serious, sort of, reversals or mixed messages that you could possibly send.",2004-09-30,Democrat

Secondly, he said  my opponent said where he worked to put sanctions on Iran  weve already sanctioned Iran. We cant sanction them any more. There are sanctions in place on Iran.

And its been labeled an act of ongoing genocide. Yet neither one of you or anyone else connected with your campaigns or your administration that I can find has discussed the possibility of sending in troops.",2004-09-30,Moderator
Kerry,"Well, Ill tell you exactly why not, but I first want to say something about those sanctions on Iran. Only the United States put the sanctions on alone, and thats exactly what Im talking about. In order for the sanctions to be effective, we should have been working with the British, French and Germans and other countries. And thats the difference between the president and me. And there, again, he sort of slid by the question. Now, with respect to Darfur, yes, it is a genocide. And months ago, many of us were pressing for action. I think the reason that were not saying send American troops in at this point is severalfold. Number one, we can do this through the African Union, providing we give them the logistical support. Right now all the president is providing is humanitarian support. We need to do more than that. Theyve got to have the logistical capacity to go in and stop the killing. And thats going to require more than is on the table today. I also believe that it is  one of the reasons we cant do it is were overextended. Ask the people in the armed forces today. Weve got Guards and Reserves who are doing double duties. Weve got a backdoor draft taking place in America today: people with stop-loss programs where theyre told you cant get out of the military; nine out of our 10 active duty divisions committed to Iraq one way or the other, either going, coming or preparing. So this is the way the president has overextended the United States. Thats why, in my plan, I add two active duty divisions to the United States Army, not for Iraq, but for our general demands across the globe. I also intend to double the number of special forces so that we can do the job we need to do with respect fighting the terrorists around the world. And if we do that, then we have the ability to be able to respond more rapidly. But Ill tell you this, as president, if it took American forces to some degree to coalesce the African Union, Id be prepared to do it because we could never allow another Rwanda.

And Colin Powell so stated. We have committed $200 million worth of aid. Were the leading donor in the world to help the suffering people there. We will commit more over time to help. We were very much involved at the U.N. on the sanction policy of the Bashir government in the Sudan. Prior to Darfur, Ambassador Jack Danforth had been negotiating a north-south agreement that we would have hoped would have brought peace to the Sudan. I agree with my opponent that we shouldnt be committing troops. We ought to be working with the African Union to do so  precisely what we did in Liberia. We helped stabilize the situation with some troops, and when the African Union came, we moved them out. My hope is that the African Union moves rapidly to help save lives.

I admire the fact that he served for 20 years in the Senate. Although Im not so sure I admire the record. I wont hold it against him that he went to Yale. Theres nothing wrong with that. My concerns about the senator is that, in the course of this campaign, Ive been listening very carefully to what he says, and he changes positions on the war in Iraq. He changes positions on something as fundamental as what you believe in your core, in your heart of hearts, is right in Iraq. You cannot lead if you send mixed messages. Mixed messages send the wrong signals to our troops. Mixed messages send the wrong signals to our allies. Mixed messages send the wrong signals to the Iraqi citizens. And thats my biggest concern about my opponent. I admire his service. But I just know how this world works, and that in the councils of government, there must be certainty from the U.S. president.

At the rate that the president is currently securing it, itll take 13 years to get it. I did a lot of work on this. I wrote a book about it several years ago  six, seven years ago  called The New War, which saw the difficulties of this international criminal network. And back then, we intercepted a suitcase in a Middle Eastern country with nuclear materials in it. And the black market sale price was about $250 million. Now, there are terrorists trying to get their hands on that stuff today. And this president, I regret to say, has secured less nuclear material in the last two years since 9/11 than we did in the two years preceding 9/11. We have to do this job. And to do the job, you cant cut the money for it. The president actually cut the money for it. You have to put the money into it and the funding and the leadership. And part of that leadership is sending the right message to places like North Korea. Right now the president is spending hundreds of millions of dollars to research bunker-busting nuclear weapons. The United States is pursuing a new set of nuclear weapons. It doesnt make sense. You talk about mixed messages. Were telling other people, You cant have nuclear weapons, but were pursuing a new nuclear weapon that we might even contemplate using. Not this president. Im going to shut that program down, and were going to make it clear to the world were serious about containing nuclear proliferation. And were going to get the job of containing all of that nuclear material in Russia done in four years. And were going to build the strongest international network to prevent nuclear proliferation.

And thats why proliferation is one of the centerpieces of a multi-prong strategy to make the country safer. My administration started whats called the Proliferation Security Initiative. Over 60 nations involved with disrupting the trans-shipment of information and/or weapons of mass destruction materials. And weve been effective. We busted the A.Q. Khan network. This was a proliferator out of Pakistan that was selling secrets to places like North Korea and Libya. We convinced Libya to disarm. Its a central part of dealing with weapons of mass destruction and proliferation. Ill tell you another way to help protect America in the long run is to continue with missile defenses. And weve got a robust research and development program that has been ongoing during my administration. Well be implementing a missile-defense system relatively quickly.

And so Ive told him my opinion. I look forward to discussing it more with him, as time goes on. Russia is a country in transition. Vladimir is going to have to make some hard choices.

Kerry,"Well, let me just say quickly that Ive had an extraordinary experience of watching up close and personal that transition in Russia, because I was there right after the transformation. And I was probably one of the first senators, along with Senator Bob Smith of New Hampshire, a former senator, to go down into the KGB underneath Treblinka Square and see reams of files with names in them. It sort of brought home the transition to democracy that Russia was trying to make. I regret whats happened in these past months. And I think it goes beyond just the response to terror. Mr. Putin now controls all the television stations. His political opposition is being put in jail. And I think its very important to the United States, obviously, to have a working relationship that is good. This is a very important country to us. We want a partnership. But we always have to stand up for democracy. As George Will said the other day, Freedom on the march; not in Russia right now. Now, Id like to come back for a quick moment, if I can, to that issue about China and the talks. Because thats one of the most critical issues here: North Korea. Just because the president says it cant be done, that youd lose China, doesnt mean it cant be done. I mean, this is the president who said There were weapons of mass destruction, said Mission accomplished, said we could fight the war on the cheap  none of which were true. We could have bilateral talks with Kim Jong Il. And we can get those weapons at the same time as we get China. Because China has an interest in the outcome, too.",2004-09-30,Democrat

My fellow Americans, as Ive said at the very beginning of this debate, both President Bush and I love this country very much. Theres no doubt, I think, about that. But we have a different set of convictions about how we make our country stronger here at home and respected again in the world. I know that for many of you sitting at home, parents of kids in Iraq, you want to know whos the person who could be a commander in chief who could get your kids home and get the job done and win the peace. And for all the rest of the parents in America who are wondering about their kids going to the school or anywhere else in the world, what kind of world theyre going to grow up in, let me look you in the eye and say to you: I defended this country as a young man in war, and I will defend it as president of the United States. But I have a difference with this president. I believe when were strongest when we reach out and lead the world and build strong alliances. I have a plan for Iraq. I believe we can be successful. Im not talking about leaving. Im talking about winning. And we need a fresh start, a new credibility, a president who can bring allies to our side. I also have a plan to win the war on terror, funding homeland security, strengthening our military, cutting our finances, reaching out to the world, again building strong alliances. I believe Americas best days are ahead of us because I believe that the future belongs to freedom, not to fear. Thats the country that Im going to fight for. And I ask you to give me the opportunity to make you proud. I ask you to give me the opportunity to lead this great nation, so that we can be stronger here at home, respected again in the world, and have responsible leadership that we deserve. Thank you.

Bush,"Thank you very much tonight, Jim. Senator. If America shows uncertainty or weakness in this decade, the world will drift toward tragedy. Thats not going to happen, so long as Im your president. The next four years we will continue to strengthen our homeland defenses. We will strengthen our intelligence-gathering services. We will reform our military. The military will be an all-volunteer army. We will continue to stay on the offense. We will fight the terrorists around the world so we do not have to face them here at home. Well continue to build our alliances. Ill never turn over Americas national security needs to leaders of other countries, as we continue to build those alliances. And well continue to spread freedom. I believe in the transformational power of liberty. I believe that the free Iraq is in this nations interests. I believe a free Afghanistan is in this nations interest. And I believe both a free Afghanistan and a free Iraq will serve as a powerful example for millions who plead in silence for liberty in the broader Middle East. Weve done a lot of hard work together over the last three and a half years. Weve been challenged, and weve risen to those challenges. Weve climbed the mighty mountain. I see the valley below, and its a valley of peace. By being steadfast and resolute and strong, by keeping our word, by supporting our troops, we can achieve the peace we all want.

The correspondents are free to ask any questions they choose in the field of foreign affairs. Neither candidate knows what questions will be asked. Time alone will determine the final question. Reversing the order in their first meeting, Senator Kennedy will make the second opening statement and the first closing statement. For the first opening statement, here is Vice President Nixon.",1960-10-21,Moderator
Mr. Nixon,"Mr. Howe, Senator Kennedy, my fellow Americans. Since this campaign began I have had a very rare privilege. I have traveled to forty-eight of the fifty states and in my travels I have learned what the people of the United States are thinking about. There is one issue that stands out above all the rest, one in which every American is concerned, regardless of what group he may be a member and regardless of where he may live. And that issue, very simply stated, is this: how can we keep the peace  keep it without surrender? How can we extend freedom  extend it without war? Now in determining how we deal with this issue, we must find the answer to a very important but simple question: who threatens the peace? Who threatens freedom in the world? There is only one threat to peace and one threat to freedom  that that is presented by the international Communist movement. And therefore if we are to have peace, we must know how to deal with the Communists and their leaders. I know Mr. Khrushchev. I also have had the opportunity of knowing and meeting other Communist leaders in the world. I believe there are certain principles we must find in dealing with him and his colleagues  principles, if followed, that will keep the peace and that also can extend freedom. First, we have to learn from the past, because we cannot afford to make the mistakes of the past. In the seven years before this Administration came into power in Washington, we found that six hundred million people went behind the Iron Curtain. And at the end of that seven years we were engaged in a war in Korea which cost of thirty thousand American lives. In the past seven years, in President Eisenhowers Administration, this situation has been reversed. We ended the Korean War; by strong, firm leadership we have kept out of other wars; and we have avoided surrender of principle or territory at the conference table. Now why were we successful, as our predecessors were not successful? I think therere several reasons. In the first place, they made a fatal error in misjudging the Communists; in trying to apply to them the same rules of conduct that you would apply to the leaders of the free world. One of the major errors they made was the one that led to the Korean War. In ruling out the defense of Korea, they invited aggression in that area. They thought they were going to have peace  it brought war. We learned from their mistakes. And so, in our seven years, we find that we have been firm in our diplomacy; we have never made concessions without getting concessions in return. We have always been willing to go the extra mile to negotiate for disarmament or in any other area. But we have never been willing to do anything that, in effect, surrendered freedom any place in the world. That is why President Eisenhower was correct in not apologizing or expressing regrets to Mr. Khrushchev at the Paris Conference, as Senator Kennedy suggested he could have done. That is why Senator wh- President Eisenhower was also correct in his policy in the Formosa Straits, where he declined, and refused to follow the recommendations  recommendations which Senator Kennedy voted for in 1955; again made in 1959; again repeated in his debates that you have heard  recommendations with regard to  again  slicing off a piece of free territory, and abandoning it, if  in effect, to the Communists. Why did the President feel this was wrong and why was the President right and his critics wrong? Because again this showed a lack of understanding of dictators, a lack of understanding particularly of Communists, because every time you make such a concession it does not lead to peace; it only encourages them to blackmail you. It encourages them to begin a war. And so I say that the record shows that we know how to keep the peace, to keep it without surrender. Let us move now to the future. It is not enough to stand on this record because we are dealing with the most ruthless, fanatical leaders that the world has ever seen. That is why I say that in this period of the sixties, America must move forward in every area. First of all, although we are today, as Senator Kennedy has admitted, the strongest nation in the world militarily, we must increase our strength, increase it so that we will always have enough strength that regardless of what our potential opponents have  if the should launch a surprise attack  we will be able to destroy their war-making capability. They must know, in other words, that it is national suicide if they begin anything. We need this kind of strength because were the guardians of the peace. In addition to military strength, we need to see that the economy of this country continues to grow. It has grown in the past seven years. It can and will grow even more in the next four. And the reason that it must grow even more is because we have things to do at home and also because were in a race for survival  a race in which it isnt enough to be ahead; it isnt enough simply to be complacent. We have to move ahead in order to stay ahead. And that is why, in this field, I have made recommendations which I am confident will move the American economy ahead  move it firmly and soundly so that there will never be a time when the Soviet Union will be able to challenge our superiority in this field. And so we need military strength, we need economic strength, we also need the right diplomatic policies. What are they? Again we turn to the past. Firmness but no belligerence, and by no belligerence I mean that we do not answer insult by insult. When you are proud and confident of your strength, you do not get down to the level of Mr. Khrushchev and his colleagues. And that example that President Eisenhower has set we will continue to follow. But all this by itself is not enough. It is not enough for us simply to be the strongest nation militarily, the strongest economically, and also to have firm diplomacy. We must have a great goal. And that is: not just to keep freedom for ourselves but to extend it to all the world, to extend it to all the world because that is Americas destiny. To extend it to all the world because the Communist aim is not to hold their own but to extend Communism. And you cannot fight a victory for Communism or a strategy of victory for Communism with the strategy, simply of holding the line. And so I say that we believe that our policies of military strength, of economic strength, of diplomatic firmness first will keep the peace and keep it without surrender. We also believe that in the great field of ideals that we can lead America to the victory for freedom  victory in the newly developing countries, victory also in the captive countries  provided we have faith in ourselves and faith in our principles.",1960-10-21,Republican
Mr. Howe,Now the opening statement of Senator Kennedy.,1960-10-21,Moderator
Mr. Kennedy,"Mr. Howe, Mr. Vice President. First uh  let me again try to correct the record on the matter of Quemoy and Matsu. I voted for the Formosa resolution in 1955. I have sustained it since then. Ive said that I agree with the Administration policy. Mr. Nixon earlier indicated that he would defend Quemoy and Matsu even if the attack on these islands, two miles off the coast of China, were not part of a general attack an Formosa and the Pescadores. I indicated that I would defend those islands if the attack were directed against Pescadores and Formosa, which is part of the Eisenhower policy. Ive supported that policy. In the last week, as a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, I have re-read the testimony of General Twining representing the Administration in 1959, and the Assistant Secretary of State before the Foreign Relations Committee in 1958, and I have accurately described the Administration policy, and I support it wholeheartedly. So that really isnt an issue in this campaign. It isnt an issue with Mr. Nixon, who now says that he also supports the Eisenhower policy. Nor is the question that all Americans want peace and security an issue in this campaign. The question is: are we moving in the direction of peace and security? Is our relative strength growing? Is, as Mr. Nixon says, our prestige at an all-time high, as he said a week ago, and that of the Communists at an all-time low? I dont believe it is. I dont believe that our relative strength is increasing. And I say that not as the Democratic standard-bearer, but as a citizen of the United States who is concerned about the United States. I look at Cuba, ninety miles off the coast of the United States. In 1957 I was in Havana. I talked to the American Ambassador there. He said that he was the second most powerful man in Cuba. And yet even though Ambassador Smith and Ambassador Gardner, both Republican Ambassadors, both warned of Castro, the Marxist influences around Castro, the Communist influences around Castro, both of them have testified in the last six weeks, that in spite of their warnings to the American government, nothing was done. Our d- security depends upon Latin America. Can any American looking at the situation in Latin America feel contented with whats happening today, when a candidate for the presidency of Brazil feels it necessary to call  not on Washington during the campaign  but on Castro in Havana, in order to pick up the support of the Castro supporters in Brazil? At the American Conference  Inter-American Conference this summer, when we wanted them to join together in the denunciation of Castro and the Cuban Communists, we couldnt even get the Inter-American group to join together in denouncing Castro. It was rather a vague statement that they finally made. Do you know today that the Com- the Russians broadcast ten times as many programs in Spanish to Latin America as we do? Do you know we dont have a single program sponsored by our government to Cuba  to tell them our story, to tell them that we are their friends, that we want them to be free again? Africa is now the emerging area of the world. It contains twenty-five percent of all the members of the General Assembly. We didnt even have a Bureau of African Affairs until 1957. In the Africa south of the Sahara, which is the major new section, we have less students from all of Africa in that area studying under government auspices today than from the country of Thailand. If theres one thing Africa needs its technical assistance. And yet last year we gave them less than five percent of all the technical assistance funds that we distributed around the world. We relied in the Middle East on the Baghdad Pact, and yet when the Iraqi Government was changed, the Baghdad Pact broke down. We relied on the Eisenhower Doctrine for the Middle East, which passed the Senate. There isnt one country in the Middle East that now endorses the Eisenhower Doctrine. We look to Europe uh  to Asia because the struggle is in the underdeveloped world. Which system, Communism or freedom, will triumph in the next five or ten years? Thats what should concern us, not the history of ten, or fifteen, or twenty years ago. But are we doing enough in these areas? What are freedoms chances in those areas? By 1965 or 1970, will there be other Cubas in Latin America? Will Guinea and Ghana, which have now voted with the Communists frequently as newly independent countries of Africa  will there be others? Will the Congo go Communist? Will other countries? Are we doing enough in that area? And what about Asia? Is India going to win the economic struggle or is China going to win it? Who will dominate Asia in the next five or ten years? Communism? The Chinese? Or will freedom? The question which we have to decide as Americans  are we doing enough today? Is our strength and prestige rising? Do people want to be identified with us? Do they want to follow United States leadership? I dont think they do, enough. And thats what concerns me. In Africa  these countries that have newly joined the United Nations. On the question of admission of Red China, only two countries in all of Africa voted with us  Liberia and the Union of South Africa. The rest either abstained or voted against us. More countries in Asia voted against us on that question than voted with us. I believe that this struggle is going to go on, and it may be well decided in the next decade. I have seen Cuba go to the Communists. I have seen Communist influence and Castro influence rise in Latin America. I have seen us ignore Africa. There are six countries in Africa that are members of the United Nations. There isnt a single American diplomatic representative in any of those six. When Guinea became independent, the Soviet Ambassador showed up that very day. We didnt recognize them for two months; the American Ambassador didnt show up for nearly eight months. I believe that the world is changing fast. And I dont think this Administration has shown the foresight, has shown the knowledge, has been identified with the great fight which these people are waging to be free, to get a better standard of living, to live better. The average income in some of those countries is twenty-five dollars a year. The Communists say, Come with us; look what weve done. And weve been in  on the whole, uninterested. I think were going to have to do better. Mr. Nixon talks about our being the strongest country in the world. I think we are today. But we were far stronger relative to the Communists five years ago, and what is of great concern is that the balance of power is in danger of moving with them. They made a breakthrough in missiles, and by nineteen sixty-one, two, and three, they will be outnumbering us in missiles. Im not as confident as he is that we will be the strongest military power by 1963. He talks about economic growth as a great indicator of freedom. I agree with him. What we do in this country, the kind of society that we build, that will tell whether freedom will be sustained around the world. And yet, in the last nine months of this year, weve had a drop in our economic growth rather than a gain. Weve had the lowest rate of increase of economic growth in the last nine months of any major industrialized society in the world. I look up and see the Soviet flag on the moon. The fact is that the State Department polls on our prestige and influence around the world have shown such a sharp drop that up till now the State Department has been unwilling to release them. And yet they were polled by the U.S.I.A. The point of all this is, this is a struggle in which were engaged. We want peace. We want freedom. We want security. We want to be stronger. We want freedom to gain. But I dont believe in these changing and revolutionary times this Administration has known that the world is changing  has identified itself with that change. I think the Communists have been moving with vigor  Laos, Africa, Cuba  all around the world today theyre on the move. I think we have to revita1ize our society. I think we have to demonstrate to the people of the world that were determined in this free country of ours to be first  not first if, and not first but, and not first when  but first. And when we are strong and when we are first, then freedom gains; then the prospects for peace increase; then the prospects for our society gain.",1960-10-21,Democrat

Now the candidates will answer and comment upon questions put by these four correspondents: Frank Singiser of Mutual News, John Edwards of ABC News, Walter Cronkite of CBS News, John Chancellor of NBC News. Frank Singiser has the first question for Vice President Nixon.",1960-10-21,Moderator
Mr. Singiser,"Mr. Vice President, Id like to pin down the difference between the way you would handle Castros regime and prevent the establishment of Communist governments in the Western Hemisphere and the way that t Senator Kennedy would proceed. Uh  Vice President Nixon, in what important respects do you feel there are differences between you, and why do you believe your policy is better for the peace and security of the United States in the Western Hemisphere?",1960-10-21,Moderator
Mr. Nixon,"Our policies are very different. I think that Senator Kennedys policies and recommendations for the handling of the Castro regime are probably the most dangers- dangerously irresponsible recommendations that hes made during the course of this campaign. In effect, what Senator Kennedy recommends is that the United States government should give help to the exiles and to those within Cuba who oppose the Castro regime  provided they are anti-Batista. Now lets just see what this means. We have five treaties with Latin America, including the one setting up the Organization of American States in Bogota in 1948, in which we have agreed not to intervene in the internal affairs of any other American country  and they as well have agreed to do likewise. The charter of the United Nations  its Preamble, Article I and Article II  also provide that there shall be no intervention by one nation in the internal affairs of another. Now I dont know what Senator Kennedy suggests when he says that we should help those who oppose the Castro regime, both in Cuba and without. But I do know this: that if we were to follow that recommendation, that we would lose all of our friends in Latin America, we would probably be condemned in the United Nations, and we would not accomplish our objective. I know something else. It would be an open invitation for Mr. Khrushchev to come in, to come into Latin America and to engage us in what would be a civil war, and possibly even worse than that. This is the major recommendation that hes made. Now, what can we do? Well, we can do what we did with Guatemala. There was a Communist dictator that we inherited from the previous Administration. We quarantined Mr. Arbenz. The result was that the Guatemalan people themselves eventually rose up and they threw him out. We are quarantining Mr. Castro today. Were quarantining him diplomatically by bringing back our Ambassador; economically by cutting off trade, and Senator Kennedys suggestion that the trade that we cut off is not significant is just one hundred percent wrong. We are cutting off the significant items that the Cuban regime needs in order to survive. By cutting off trade, by cutting off our diplomatic relations as we have, we will quarantine this regime so that the people of Cuba themselves will take care of Mr. Castro. But for us to do what Senator Kennedy has suggested would bring results which I know he would not want, and certainly which the American people would not want.",1960-10-21,Republican
Mr. Kennedy,"Mr. Nixon uh  shows himself i- misinformed. He surely must be aware that most of the equipment and arms and resources for Castro came from the United States, flowed out of Florida and other parts of the United States to Castro in the mountains. There isnt any doubt about that, number one. Number two, I believe that if any economic sanctions against Latin America are going to be successful they have to be multilateral. They have to include the other countries of Latin America. The very minute effect of the action which has been taken this week on Cubas economy  I believe Castro can replace those markets very easily through Latin America, through Europe, and through Eastern Europe. If the United States had stronger prestige and influence in Latin America it could persuade  as Franklin Roosevelt did in 1940  the countries of Latin America to join in an economic quarantine of Castro. Thats the only way you can bring real economic pressure on the Castro regime  and also the countries of Western Europe, Canada, Japan and the others. Number three, Castro is only the beginning of our difficulties throughout Latin America. The big struggle will be to prevent the influence of Castro spreading to other countries  Mexico, Panama, Bolivia, Colombia. Were going to have to try to provide closer ties, to associate ourselves with the great desire of these people for a better life if were going to prevent Castros influence from spreading throughout all of Latin America. His influence is strong enough today to prevent us from joi- getting the other countries of Latin America to join with us in economic quarantine. His influence is growing  mostly because this Administration has ignored Latin America. You yourself said, Mr. Vice President, a month ago, that if we had provided the kind of economic aid five years ago that we are now providing we might never have had Castro. Why didnt we?",1960-10-21,Democrat
Mr. Howe,John Edwards has his first question for Senator Kennedy.,1960-10-21,Moderator
Mr. Edwards,"Senator Kennedy, one test of a new presidents leadership will be the caliber of his appointments. Its a matter of interest here and overseas as to who will be the new secretary of state. Now, under our rules, I must ask this question of you, but I would hope that the Vice President also would answer it. Will you give us the names of three or four Americans, each of whom, if appointed, would serve with distinction in your judgment as secretary of state?",1960-10-21,Moderator
Mr. Kennedy,"Mr. Edwards, I dont think its a wise idea for presidential candidates to appoint the members of his cabinet prospectively, or to suggest four people  indicate that one of them surely will be appointed. This is a decision that the president of the United States must make. The last candidate who indicated that he knew who his cabinet was going to be was Mr. Dewey in 1948. This is a race between the Vice President and myself for the presidency of the United States. There are a good many able men who could be secretary of state. Ive made no judgment about who should be secretary of state. I think that judgment could be made after election, if Im successful. The people have to make a choice between Mr. Nixon and myself, between the Republican party and the Democratic party, between our approach to the problems which now disturb us as a nation and disturb us as a world power. The president bears the constitutional responsibility, not the secretary of state, for the conduct of foreign affairs. Some presidents have been strong in foreign policy; others have relied heavily on the secretary of state. Ive been a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee; I run for the presidency with full knowledge that his great responsibility, really, given to him by the Constitution and by the force of events, is in the field of foreign affairs. Im asking the peoples support as president. We will select the best man we can get. But Ive not made a judgment, and I have not narrowed down a list of three or four people, among whom would be the candidate.",1960-10-21,Democrat
Mr. Howe,"Mr. Vice President, do you have a comment?",1960-10-21,Moderator
Mr. Nixon,"Well Mr. Edwards, as you probably know, I have consistently answered all questions with regard to who will be in the next cabinet by saying that that is the responsibility of the next president, and it would be inappropriate to make any decisions on that or to announce any prior to the time that I had the right to do so. So that is my answer to this question. If you dont mind, Id like to use the balance of the time to respond to one of the comments that Senator Kennedy made on the previous question. Eh- He was talking about the Castro regime and what we had been eh- doing in Latin America. I would like to point out that when we look at our programs in Latin America, we find that we have appropriated five times as much for Latin America as was appropriated by the previous Administration; we find that we have two billion dollars more for the Export-Import Bank; we have a new bank for Latin America alone of a billion dollars; we have the new program which was submitted at the Bogota Conference  this new program that President Eisenhower submitted, approved by the last Congress  for five hundred million dollars. We have moved in Latin America very effectively, and Id also like to point this out: Senator Kennedy complains very appropriately about our inadequate ra- radio broadcasts for Latin America. Let me point out again that his Congress  the Democratic Congress  has cut eighty million dollars off of the Voice of America appropriations. Now, he has to get a better job out of his Congress if hes going to get us the money that we need to conduct the foreign affairs of this country in Latin America or any place else.",1960-10-21,Republican
Mr. Howe,"Walter Cronkite, you have your first question for Vice President Nixon.",1960-10-21,Moderator
Mr. Cronkite,"Thank you Quincy. Mr. Vice President, Senator Fulbright and now tonight, Senator Kennedy, maintain that the Administration is suppressing a report by the United States Information Agency that shows a decline in United States prestige overseas. Are you aware of such a report, and if you are aware of the existence of such a report, should not that report, because of the great importance this issue has been given in this campaign, be released to the public?",1960-10-21,Moderator
Mr. Nixon,"Mr. Cronkite, I naturally am aware of it, because I, of course, pay attention to everything Senator Kennedy says, as well as Senator Fulbright. Now, in this connection I want to point out that the facts simply arent as stated. First of all, the report to which Senator Kennedy refers is one that was made many, many months ago and related particularly to the uh  period immediately after Sputnik. Second, as far as this report is concerned, I would have no objection to having it made public. Third, I would say this with regard to this report, with regard to Gallup Polls of prestige abroad and everything else that weve been hearing about what about American prestige abroad: Americas prestige abroad will be just as high as the spokesmen for America allow it to be. Now, when we have a presidential candidate, for example  Senator Kennedy  stating over and over again that the United States is second in space and the fact of the matter is that the space score today is twenty-eight to eight  weve had twenty-eight successful shots, theyve had eight; when he states that were second in education, and I have seen Soviet education and Ive seen ours, and were not; that were second in science because they may be ahead in one area or another, when overall were way ahead of the Soviet Union and all other countries in science; when he says as he did in January of this year that we have the worst slums, that we have the most crowded schools; when he says that seventeen million people go to bed hungry every night; when he makes statements like this, what does this do to American prestige? Well, it can only have the effect certainly of reducing it. Well let me make one thing clear. Senator Kennedy has a responsibility to criticize those things that are wrong, but he has also a responsibility to be right in his criticism. Every one of these items that I have mentioned hes been wrong  dead wrong. And for that reason he has contributed to any lack of prestige. Finally, let me say this: as far as prestige is concerned, the first place it would show up would be in the United Nations. Now Senator Kennedy has referred to the vote on Communist China. Lets look at the vote on Hungary. There we got more votes for condemning Hungary and looking into that situation than we got the last year. Lets look at the reaction eh  reaction to Khrushchev and Eisenhower at the last U.N. session. Did Khrushchev gain because he took his shoe off and pounded the table and shouted and insulted? Not at all. The President gained. America gained by continuing the dignity, the decency that has characterized us and its that that keeps the prestige of America up, not running down America the way Senator Kennedy has been running her down.",1960-10-21,Republican
Mr. Howe,"Comment, Senator Kennedy?",1960-10-21,Moderator
Mr. Kennedy,"I really dont need uh  Mr. Nixon to tell me about what my responsibilities are as a citizen. Ive served this country for fourteen years in the Congress and before that in the service. Ive just as high a devotion, just as high an opinion. What I downgrade, Mr. Nixon, is the leadership the country is getting, not the country. Now I didnt make most of the statements that you said I made. The s- I believe the Soviet Union is first in outer space. We have  may have made more shots but the size of their rocket thrust and all the rest  you yourself said to Khrushchev, You may be ahead of us in rocket thrust but were ahead of you in color television in your famous discussion in the kitchen. I think that color television is not as important as rocket thrust. Secondly, I didnt say we had the worst slums in the world. I said we had too many slums. And that they are bad, and we ought to do something about them, and we ought to support housing legislation which this Administration has opposed. I didnt say we had the worst education in the world. What I said was that ten years ago, we were producing twice as many scientists and engineers as the Soviet Union and today theyre producing twice as many as we are, and that this affects our security around the world. And fourth, I believe that the polls and other studies and votes in the United Nations and anyone reading the paper and any citizen of the United States must come to the conclusion that the United States no longer carries the same image of a vital society on the move with its brightest days ahead as it carried a decade or two decades ago. Part of that is because weve stood still here at home, because we havent met our problems in the United States, because we havent had a moving economy. Part of that, as the Gallup Polls show, is because the Soviet Union made a breakthrough in outer space. Mr. George Allen, head of your Information Service, has said that that made the people of the world begin to wonder whether we were first in science. Were first in other areas of science but in space, which is the new science, were not first.",1960-10-21,Democrat
Mr. Howe,"John Chancellor, your first question for Senator Kennedy.",1960-10-21,Moderator
Mr. Chancellor,"Senator, another question uh  in connection with our relations with the Russians. There have been stories from Washington from the Atomic Energy Commission hinting that the Russians may have resumed the testing of nuclear devices. Now if  sir, if this is true, should the United States resume nuclear testing, and if the Russians do not start testing, can you foresee any circumstances in 1961 in which the United States might resume its own series of tests?",1960-10-21,Moderator
Mr. Kennedy,"Yes, I think the next president of the United States should make one last effort to secure an agreement on the cessation of tests, number one. I think we should go back to Geneva, whos ever elected president, Mr. Nixon or myself, and try once again. If we fail then, if were unable to come to an agreement  and I hope we can come to an agreement because it does not merely involve now the United States, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union as atomic powers. Because new breakthroughs in atomic energy technology theres some indications that by the time the next presidents term of office has come to an end, there may be ten, fifteen, or twenty countries with an atomic capacity, perhaps that many testing bombs with all the effect that it could have on the atmosphere and with all the chances that more and more countries will have an atomic capacity, with more and more chance of war. So one more effort should be made. I dont think that even if that effort fails that it will be necessary to carry on tests in the atmosphere which pollute the atmosphere. They can be carried out underground, they c- could be carried on in outer space. But I believe the effort should be made once more by whos ever elected president of the United States. If we fail, its been a great serious failure for everyone  for the human race. I hope we can succeed. But then if we fail responsibility will be clearly on the Russians and then well have to meet our responsibilities to the security of the United States, and there may have to be testing underground. I think the Atomic Energy Committee is prepared for it. There may be testing in outer space. I hope it will not be necessary for any power to resume uh  testing in the atmosphere. Its possible to detect those kind of tests. The kind of tests which you cant detect are underground or in  in uh  perhaps in outer space. So that Im hopeful we can try once more. If we fail then we must meet our responsibilities to ourselves. But Im most concerned about the whole problem of the spread of atomic weapons. China may have it by 1963, Egypt. War has been the constant companion of mankind, so to have these weapons disseminated around the world, I believe means that were going to move through a period of hazard in the next few years. We ought to make one last effort.",1960-10-21,Democrat
Mr. Howe,"Any comment, Mr. Vice President?",1960-10-21,Moderator
Mr. Nixon,"Yes. I would say first of all that we must have in mind the fact that we have been negotiating to get tests inspected and uh  to get an agreement for many, many months. As a matter of fact, theres been a moratorium on testing as a result of the fact that we have been negotiating. Ive reached the conclusion that the Soviet Union is actually filibustering. Ive reached the conclusion, too, based on the reports that have been made, that they may be cheating. I dont think we can wait until the next president is inaugurated and then uh  select a new team and then all the months of negotiating that will take place before we reach a decision, I think that immediately after this election we should set a timetable  the next president, working with the present President, President Eisenhower  a timetable to break the Soviet filibuster. There should be no tests in the atmosphere; that rules out any fall-out. But as far as underground tests for developing peaceful uses of atomic energy, we should not allow this Soviet filibuster to continue. I think its time for them to fish or cut bait. I think that the next president immediately after his election should sit down with the President, work out a timetable, and  get a decision on this before January of next year.",1960-10-21,Republican
Mr. Howe,Our second round of questions begins with one from Mr. Edwards for the Vice President.,1960-10-21,Moderator
Mr. Edwards,"Mr. Nixon, carrying forward this business about a timetable; as you know, the pressures are increasing for a summit conference. Now, both you and Senator Kennedy have said that there are certain conditions which must be met before you would meet with Khrushchev. Will you be more specific about these conditions?",1960-10-21,Moderator
Mr. Nixon,"Well the conditions I laid out in one of our previous television debates, and its rather difficult to be much more specific than that. Uh  First of all, we have to have adequate preparation for a summit conference. This means at the secretary of state level and at the ambassadorial level. By adequate preparation I mean that at that level we must prepare an agenda, an agenda agreed upon with the approval of the heads of state involved. Now this agenda should delineate those issues on which there is a possibility of some agreement or negotiation. I dont believe we should go to a summit conference unless we have such an agenda, unless we have some reasonable insur- assurance from Mr. Khrushchev that he intends seriously to negotiate on those points. Now this may seem like a rigid, inflexible position. But lets look at the other side of the coin. If we build up the hopes of the world by having a summit conference that is not adequately prepared, and then, if Mr. Khrushchev finds some excuse for breaking it up  as he did this one  because he isnt going to get his way  wed set back the cause of peace. We do not help it. We can, in other words, negotiate many of these items of difference between us without going to the summit. I think we have to make a greater effort than we have been making at the secretary of state level, at the ambassadorial level, to work out the differences that we have. And so far as the summit conference is concerned, it should only be entered in upon, it should only be agreed upon, if the negotiations have reached the point that we have some reasonable assurance that something is going to come out of it, other than some phony spirit  a spirit of Geneva, or Camp David, or whatever it is. When I say phony spirit, I mean phony, not because the spirit is not good on our side, but because the Soviet Union simply doesnt intend to carry out what they say. Now, these are the conditions that I can lay out. I cannot be more precise than that, because until we see what Mr. Khrushchev does and what he says uh  we cannot indicate what our plans will be.",1960-10-21,Republican
Mr. Howe,"Any comments, Senator Kennedy?",1960-10-21,Moderator
Mr. Kennedy,"Well, I think the president of the United States last winter indicated that before hed go to the summit in May he did last fall, he indicated that there should be some agenda, that there should be some prior agreement. He hoped that there would be uh  b- be an agreement in part in disarmament. He also expressed the hope that there should be some understanding of the general situation in Berlin. The Soviet Union refused to agree to that, and we went to the summit and it was disastrous. I believe we should not go to the summit until there is some reason to believe that a meeting of minds can be obtained on either Berlin, outer space, or general disarmament  including nuclear testing. In addition, I believe the next president in January and February should go to work in building the strength of the United States. The Soviet Union does understand strength. We arm to parley, Winston Churchill said ten years ago. If we are strong, particularly as we face a crisis over Berlin  which we may in the spring, or in the winter  its important that we maintain our determination here; that we indicate that were building our strength; that we are determined to protect our position; that were determined to protect our commitment. And then I believe we should indicate our desire to live at peace with the world. But until were strong here, until were moving here, I believe a summit could not be successful. I hope that before we do meet, there will be preliminary agreements on those four questions, or at least two of them, or even one of them, which would warrant such a meeting. I think if we had stuck by that position last winter, we would have been in a better position in May.",1960-10-21,Democrat
Mr. Howe,We have time for only one or two more questions before the closing statements. Now Walter Cronkites question for Senator Kennedy.,1960-10-21,Moderator
Mr. Cronkite,"Senator, the charge has been made frequently that the United States for many years has been on the defensive around the world, that our policy has been uh  one of reaction to the Soviet Union rather than positive action on our own. What areas do you see where the United States might take the offensive in a challenge to Communism over the next four to eight years?",1960-10-21,Moderator
Mr. Kennedy,"One of the areas, and of course the most vulnerable area is  I have felt, has been Eastern Europe. Ive been critical of the Administrations failure to suggest policies which would make it possible for us to establish, for example, closer relations with Poland, particularly after the fifty-five-fifty-six period and the Hungarian revolution. We indicated at that time that we were not going to intervene militarily. But there was a period there when Poland demonstrated a national independence and even the Polish government moved some differn- di- distance away from the Soviet Union. I suggested that we amend our legislation so that we could enjoy closer economic ties. We received the support first of the Administration and then not, and we were defeated by one vote in the Senate. We passed the bill in the Senate this year but it didnt pass the House. I would say Eastern Europe is the area of vulnerability of the uh  s- of the Soviet Union. Secondly, the relations between Russia and China. They are now engaged in a debate over whether war is the means of Communizing the world or whether they should use subversion, infiltration, economic struggles and all the rest. No one can say what that course of action will be, but I think the next president of the United States should watch it carefully. If those two powers should split, it could have great effects throughout the entire world. Thirdly, I believe that India represents a great area for affirmative action by the free world. India started from about the same place that China did. Chinese Communists have been moving ahead the last ten years. India under a free society has been making some progress. But if India does not succeed  with her four hundred and fifty million people, if she cant make freedom work  then people around the world are going to determine  particularly in the underdeveloped world  that the only way that they can develop their resources is through the Communist system. Fourth, let me say that in Africa, Asia, Latin America, Eastern Europe, the great force on our side is the desire of people to be free. This has expressed itself in the revolts in Eastern Europe. Its expressed itself in the desire of the people of Africa to be independent of Western Europe. They want to be free. And my judgment is that they dont want to give their freedom up to become Communists. They want to stay free, independent perhaps of us, but certainly independent of the Communists. And I believe if we identify ourselves with that force, if we identify ourselves with it as Lincoln, as Wilson did, as Franklin Roosevelt did, if we become known as the friend of freedom, sustaining freedom, helping freedom, helping these people in the fight against poverty and ignorance and disease, helping them build their lives, I believe in Latin America, Africa, and Asia, eventually in the Eastern Europe and the Middle East, certainly in Western Europe, we can strengthen freedom. We can make it move. We can put the Communists on the defensive.",1960-10-21,Democrat
Mr. Howe,"Your comment, Mr. Vice President?",1960-10-21,Moderator
Mr. Nixon,"First, with regard to Poland, when I talked to Mr. Gomulka, the present leader of Poland, for six hours in Warsaw last year, I learned something about their problems and particularly his. Right under the Soviet gun, with Soviet troops there, he is in a very difficult position in taking anything independent, a position which would be independent of the Soviet Union. And yet lets just see what weve done for Poland, A half a billion dollars worth of aid has gone to Poland, primarily economic, primarily to go to the people of Poland. This should continue and it can be stepped up to give them hope and to keep alive the hope for freedom that I can testify they have so deeply within them. In addition we can have more exchange with Poland or with any other of the Iron Curtain countries which show some desire to take a different path than the path that has been taken by the ones that are complete satellites of the Soviet Union. Now as far as the balance of the world is concerned, I of course dont have as much time as Senator Kennedy had. I would just like to s- add this one point. If we are going to have the initiative in the world, we must remember that the people of Africa and Asia and Latin America dont want to be pawns simply in a struggle between two great powers  the Soviet Union and the United States. We have to let them know that we want to help them, not because were simply trying to save our own skins, not because were simply trying to fight Communism; but because we care for them, because we stand for freedom, because if there were no Communism in the world, we would still fight poverty and misery and disease and tyranny. If we can get that across to the people of these countries, in this decade of the sixties, the struggle for freedom will be won.",1960-10-21,Republican
Mr. Howe,John Chancellors question for Vice President Nixon.,1960-10-21,Moderator
Mr. Chancellor,"Sir, Id like to ask you an- another question about Quemoy and Matsu. Both you and Senator Kennedy say you agree with the President on this subject and with our treaty obligations. But the subject remains in the campaign as an issue. Now is  sir, is this because each of you feels obliged to respond to the other when he talks about Quemoy and Matsu, and if thats true, do you think an end should be called to this discussion, or will it stay with us as a campaign issue?",1960-10-21,Moderator
Mr. Nixon,"I would say that the issue will stay with us as a campaign issue just as long as Senator Kennedy persists in what I think is a fundamental error. He says he supports the Presidents position. He says that he voted for the resolution. Well just let me point this out; he voted for the resolution in 1955 which gave the president the power to use the forces of the United States to defend Formosa and the offshore islands. But he also voted then for an amendment  which was lost, fortunately  an amendment which would have drawn a line and left out those islands and denied the p- right to the president to defend those islands if he thought that it was an attack on Formosa. He repeated that error in 1959, in the speech that he made. He repeated it again in a television debate that we had. Now, my point is this: Senator Kennedy has got to be consistent here. Either hes for the President and hes against the position that those who opposed the President in fifty-five and fifty-nine  and the Senators position itself, stated the other day in our debate  either he is for the President and against that position or we simply have a disagreement here that must continue to be debated. Now if the Senator in his answer to this question will say I now will depart, or retract my previous views; I think I was wrong in I 955; I think I was wrong in 1959; and I think I was wrong in our television debate to say that we should draw a line leaving out Quemoy and Matsu  draw a line in effect abandoning these islands to the Communists; then this will be right out of the campaign because there will be no issue between us. I support the Presidents position. I have always opposed drawing a line. I have opposed drawing a line because I know that the moment you draw a line, that is an encouragement for the Communists to attack  to step up their blackmail and to force you into the war that none of us want. And so I would hope that Senator Kennedy in his answer today would clear it up. It isnt enough for him to say I support the Presidents position, that I voted for the resolution. Of course, he voted for the resolution  it was virtually unanimous. But the point is, what about his error in voting for the amendment, which was not adopted, and then persisting in it in fifty-nine, persisting in it in the debate. Its very simple for him to clear it up. He can say now that he no longer believes that a line should be drawn leaving these islands out of the perimeter of defense. If he says that, this issue will not be discussed in the campaign.",1960-10-21,Republican
Mr. Howe,"Senator Kennedy, your comment.",1960-10-21,Moderator
Mr. Kennedy,"Well, Mr. Nixon, to go back to 1955. The resolution commits the president in the United States, which I supported, to defend uh  Formosa, the Pescadores, and if it was his military judgment, these islands. Then the President sent a mission, composed of Admiral Radford and Mr. Robertson, to persuade Chiang Kai-shek in the spring of fifty-five to withdraw from the two islands, because they were exposed. The President was unsuccessful; Chiang Kai-shek would not withdraw. I refer to the fact that in 1958, as a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Im very familiar with the position that the United States took in negotiating with the Chinese Communists on these two islands. General Twining, in January, fifty-nine, described the position of the United States. The position of the United States has been that this build-up, in the words of the president, has been foolish. Mr. Herter has said these islands are indefensible. Chiang Kai-shek will not withdraw. Because he will not withdraw, because hes committed to these islands, because weve been unable to persuade him to withdraw, we are in a very difficult position. And therefore, the Presidents judgment has been that we should defend the islands if, in his military judgment and the judgment of the commander in the field, the attack on these islands should be part of an overall attack on Formosa. I support that. In view of the difficulties weve had with the islands, in view of the difficulties and disputes weve had with Chiang Kai-shek, thats the only position we can take. Thats not the position you took, however. The first position you took, when this matter first came up, was that we should draw the line and commit ourselves, as a matter of principle, to defend these islands. Not as part of the defense of Formosa and the Pescadores. You showed no recognition of the Administration program to try to persuade Chiang Kai-shek for the last five years to withdraw from the islands. And I challenge you tonight to deny that the Administration has sent at least several missions to persuade Chiang Kai-sheks withdrawal from these islands.",1960-10-21,Democrat

Mr. Howe,"Under the agreed rules, gentlemen, weve exhausted the time for questions. Each candidate will now have four minutes and thirty seconds for his closing statement. Senator Kennedy will make the first final closing statement.",1960-10-21,Moderator
Mr. Kennedy,"I uh  said that Ive served this country for fourteen years. I served it uh  in the war. Im devoted to it. If I lose this election, I will continue in the Senate to try to build a stronger country. But I run because I believe this year the United States has a great opportunity to make a move forward, to make a determination here at home and around the world, that its going to reestablish itself as a vigorous society. My judgment is that the Republican party has stood still here in the United States, and its also stood still around the world. Uh  Were using about fifty percent of our steel capacity today. We had a recession in fifty-eight. We had a recession in fifty-four. Were not moving ahead in education the way we should. We didnt make a judgment in fifty-seven and fifty-six and fifty-five and fifty-four that outer space would be important. If we stand still here, if we appoint people to ambassadorships and positions in Washington who have a status quo outlook, who dont recognize that this is a revolutionary time, then the United States does not maintain its influence. And if we fail, the cause of freedom fails. I believe it incumbent upon the next president of the United States to get this country moving again, to get our economy moving ahead, to set before the American people its goals, its unfinished business. And then throughout the world appoint the best people we can get, ambassadors who can speak the language  no mere  not merely people who made a political contribution but who can speak the language. Bring students here; let them see what kind of a country we have. Mr. Nixon said that we should not regard them as pawns in the cold war; we should identify ourselves with them. If that were true, why didnt we identify ourselves with the people of Africa? Why didnt we bring students over here? Why did we suddenly offer Congo three hundred students last June when they had the tremendous revolt? That was more than we had offered to all of Africa before from the federal government. I believe that this party  Republican party  has stood still really for twenty-five years  its leadership has. It opposed all of the programs of President Roosevelt and others  the minimum wage and for housing and economic growth and development of our natural resources, the Tennessee Valley and all the rest. And I believe that if we can get a party which believes in movement, which believes in going ahead, then we can reestablish our position in the world  strong defense, strong in economic growth, justice for our people, co- guarantee of constitutional rights, so that people will believe that we practice what we preach, and then around the world, particularly to try to reestablish the atmosphere which existed in Latin America at the time of Franklin Roosevelt. He was a good neighbor in Latin America because he was a good neighbor in the United States; because they saw us as a society that was compassionate, that cared about people, that was moving this country ahead. I believe it my responsibility as the leader of the Democratic party in 1960 to try to warn the American people that in this crucial time we can no longer afford to stand still. We can no longer afford to be second best. I want people all over the world to look to the United States again, to feel that were on the move, to feel that our high noon is in the future. I want Mr. Khrushchev to know that a new generation of Americans who fought in Europe and Italy and the Pacific for freedom in World War II have now taken over in the United States, and that theyre going to put this country back to work again. I dont believe that there is anything this country cannot do. I dont believe theres any burden, or any responsibility, that any American would not assume to protect his country, to protect our security, to advance the cause of freedom. And I believe it incumbent upon us now to do that. Franklin Roosevelt said in 1936 that that generation of Americans had a rendezvous with destiny. I believe in 1960 and sixty-one and two and three we have a rendezvous with destiny. And I believe it incumbent upon us to be the defenders of the United States and the defenders of freedom; and to do that, we must give this country leadership and we must get America moving again.",1960-10-21,Democrat
Mr. Howe,"Now, Vice President Nixon, your closing statement.",1960-10-21,Moderator
Mr. Nixon,"Senator Kennedy has said tonight again what he has said several times in the course of this  these debates and in the campaign, that American is standing still. America is not standing still. It has not been standing still. And lets set the record straight right now by looking at the record, as Al Smith used to say. He talks about housing. We built more houses in the last seven years than in any Administration and thirty percent more than in the previous Administration. We talk about schools  three times as many classrooms built in the past Administration  and Eisenhower  than under the Truman Administration. Lets talk about civil rights. More progress in the past eight years than in the whole eighty years before. He talks about the progress in the field of slum clearance and the like. We find four times as many projects undertaken and completed in this Administration than in the previous one. Anybody that says America has been standing still for the last seven and a half years hasnt been traveling in America. Hes been in some other country. Lets get that straight right away. Now the second point we have to understand is this, however. America has not been standing still. But America cannot stand pat. We cant stand pat for the reason that were in a race, as Ive indicated. We cant stand pat because it is essential with the conflict that we have around the world that we not just hold our own, that we not keep just freedom for ourselves. It is essential that we extend freedom, extend it to all the world. And this means more than what weve been doing. It means keeping America even stronger militarily than she is. It means seeing that our economy moves forward even faster than it has. It means making more progress in civil rights than we have so that we can be a splendid example for all the world to see  a democracy in action at its best. Now, looking at the other parts of the world  South America  talking about our record and the previous one. We had a good neighbor policy, yes. It sounded fine. But lets look at it. There were eleven dictators when we came into power in 1953 in Latin America. There are only three left. Lets look at Africa. Twenty new countries in Africa during the course of this Administration. Not one of them selected a Communist government. All of them voted for freedom  a free type of government. Does this show that Communism has the bigger pull, or freedom has the bigger pull? Am I trying to indicate that we have no problems in Africa or Latin America or Asia? Of course not. What I am trying to indicate is that the tide of historys on our side, and that we can keep it on our side, because were on the right side. Were on the side of freedom. Were on the side of justice against the forces of slavery, against the forces of injustice. But we arent going to move America forward and we arent going to be able to lead the world to win this struggle for freedom if we have a permanent inferiority complex about American achievements. Because we are first in the world in space, as Ive indicated; we are first in science; we are first in education, and were going to move even further ahead with the kind of leadership that we can provide in these years ahead. One other point I would make: what could you do? Senator Kennedy and I are candidates for the presidency of the United States. And in the years to come it will be written that one or the other of us was elected and that he was or was not a great president. What will determine whether Senator Kennedy or I, if I am elected, was a great president? It will not be our ambition that will determine it, because greatness is not something that is written on a campaign poster. It will be determined to the extent that we represent the deepest ideals, the highest feelings and faith of the American people. In other words, the next president, as he leads America and the free world, can be only as great as the American people are great. And so I say in conclusion, keep Americas faith strong. See that the young people of America, particularly, have faith in the ideals of freedom and faith in God, which distinguishes us from the atheistic materialists who oppose us.",1960-10-21,Republican
Mr. Howe,"Thank you gentlemen. Both candidates have asked me to express their thanks to the networks for this opportunity to appear on this discussion. May I repeat that all those concerned in tonights discussion have, sometimes reluctantly, followed the rules and conditions read at the outset and agreed to in advance by the candidates and the networks. The opening statements ran eight minutes each. The closing statements ran four minutes, thirty seconds. The order of speaking was reversed from their first joint appearance, when they followed the same procedure. A panel of newsmen questioned each candidate alternately. Each had two and a half minutes to reply. The other had a minute and a half to comment. But the first discussion dealt only with domestic policy. This one dealt only with foreign policy. One last word. As members of a new political generation, Vice President Nixon and Senator Kennedy have used new means of communication to pioneer a new type of political debate. The character and courage with which these two men have spoken sets a high standard for generations to come. Surely, they have set a new precedent. Perhaps they have established a new tradition.

Senator McCain, you proposed a $52 billion plan that includes new tax cuts on capital gains, tax breaks for seniors, write-offs for stock losses, among other things.

Theyre innocent victims of greed and excess on Wall Street and as well as Washington, D.C. And theyre angry, and they have every reason to be angry. And they want this country to go in a new direction. And there are elements of my proposal that you just outlined which I wont repeat. But we also have to have a short-term fix, in my view, and long- term fixes. Let me just talk to you about one of the short-term fixes. The catalyst for this housing crisis was the Fannie and Freddie Mae that caused subprime lending situation that now caused the housing market in America to collapse. I am convinced that, until we reverse this continued decline in home ownership and put a floor under it, and so that people have not only the hope and belief they can stay in their homes and realize the American dream, but that value will come up. Now, we have allocated $750 billion. Lets take 300 of that billion and go in and buy those home loan mortgages and negotiate with those people in their homes, 11 million homes or more, so that they can afford to pay the mortgage, stay in their home. Now, I know the criticism of this.",2008-10-15,Republican
Mccain,"Well, what about the citizen that stayed in their homes? That paid their mortgage payments? It doesnt help that person in their home if the next door neighbors house is abandoned. And so weve got to reverse this. We ought to put the homeowners first. And I am disappointed that Secretary Paulson and others have not made that their first priority.",2008-10-15,Republican
Schieffer,All right. Senator Obama?,2008-10-15,Moderator
Obama,"Well, first of all, I want to thank Hofstra University and the people of New York for hosting us tonight and its wonderful to join Senator McCain again, and thank you, Bob. I think everybody understands at this point that we are experiencing the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. And the financial rescue plan that Senator McCain and I supported is an important first step. And I pushed for some core principles: making sure that taxpayer can get their money back if theyre putting money up. Making sure that CEOs are not enriching themselves through this process. And I think that its going to take some time to work itself out. But what we havent yet seen is a rescue package for the middle class. Because the fundamentals of the economy were weak even before this latest crisis. So Ive proposed four specific things that I think can help. Number one, lets focus on jobs. I want to end the tax breaks for companies that are shipping jobs overseas and provide a tax credit for every company thats creating a job right here in America. Number two, lets help families right away by providing them a tax cut  a middle-class tax cut for people making less than $200,000, and lets allow them to access their IRA accounts without penalty if theyre experiencing a crisis. Now Senator McCain and I agree with your idea that weve got to help homeowners. Thats why we included in the financial package a proposal to get homeowners in a position where they can renegotiate their mortgages. I disagree with Senator McCain in how to do it, because the way Senator McCain has designed his plan, it could be a giveaway to banks if were buying full price for mortgages that now are worth a lot less. And we dont want to waste taxpayer money. And weve got to get the financial package working much quicker than it has been working. Last point I want to make, though. Weve got some long-term challenges in this economy that have to be dealt with. Weve got to fix our energy policy thats giving our wealth away. Weve got to fix our health care system and weve got to invest in our education system for every young person to be able to learn.",2008-10-15,Democrat
Schieffer,All right. Would you like to ask him a question?,2008-10-15,Moderator
Mccain,"No. I would like to mention that a couple days ago Senator Obama was out in Ohio and he had an encounter with a guy whos a plumber, his name is Joe Wurzelbacher. Joe wants to buy the business that he has been in for all of these years, worked 10, 12 hours a day. And he wanted to buy the business but he looked at your tax plan and he saw that he was going to pay much higher taxes. You were going to put him in a higher tax bracket which was going to increase his taxes, which was going to cause him not to be able to employ people, which Joe was trying to realize the American dream. Now Senator Obama talks about the very, very rich. Joe, I want to tell you, Ill not only help you buy that business that you worked your whole life for and be able  and Ill keep your taxes low and Ill provide available and affordable health care for you and your employees. And I will not have  I will not stand for a tax increase on small business income. Fifty percent of small business income taxes are paid by small businesses. Thats 16 million jobs in America. And what you want to do to Joe the plumber and millions more like him is have their taxes increased and not be able to realize the American dream of owning their own business.",2008-10-15,Republican
Schieffer,Is that what you want to do?,2008-10-15,Moderator
Mccain,Thats what Joe believes.,2008-10-15,Republican
Obama,"He has been watching ads of Senator McCains. Let me tell you what Im actually going to do. I think tax policy is a major difference between Senator McCain and myself. And we both want to cut taxes, the difference is who we want to cut taxes for. Now, Senator McCain, the centerpiece of his economic proposal is to provide $200 billion in additional tax breaks to some of the wealthiest corporations in America. Exxon Mobil, and other oil companies, for example, would get an additional $4 billion in tax breaks. What Ive said is I want to provide a tax cut for 95 percent of working Americans, 95 percent. If you make more  if you make less than a quarter million dollars a year, then you will not see your income tax go up, your capital gains tax go up, your payroll tax. Not one dime. And 95 percent of working families, 95 percent of you out there, will get a tax cut. In fact, independent studies have looked at our respective plans and have concluded that I provide three times the amount of tax relief to middle-class families than Senator McCain does.",2008-10-15,Democrat
Obama,"Now, the conversation I had with Joe the plumber, what I essentially said to him was, Five years ago, when you were in a position to buy your business, you needed a tax cut then. And what I want to do is to make sure that the plumber, the nurse, the firefighter, the teacher, the young entrepreneur who doesnt yet have money, I want to give them a tax break now. And that requires us to make some important choices. The last point Ill make about small businesses. Not only do 98 percent of small businesses make less than $250,000, but I also want to give them additional tax breaks, because they are the drivers of the economy. They produce the most jobs.",2008-10-15,Democrat
Mccain,"You know, when Senator Obama ended up his conversation with Joe the plumber  we need to spread the wealth around. In other words, were going to take Joes money, give it to Senator Obama, and let him spread the wealth around. I want Joe the plumber to spread that wealth around. You told him you wanted to spread the wealth around. The whole premise behind Senator Obamas plans are class warfare, lets spread the wealth around. I want small businesses  and by the way, the small businesses that were talking about would receive an increase in their taxes right now. Who  why would you want to increase anybodys taxes right now? Why would you want to do that, anyone, anyone in America, when we have such a tough time, when these small business people, like Joe the plumber, are going to create jobs, unless you take that money from him and spread the wealth around.",2008-10-15,Republican
Obama,OK. Can I,2008-10-15,Democrat
Mccain,Were not going to do that in my administration.,2008-10-15,Republican
Obama,"If I can answer the question. Number one, I want to cut taxes for 95 percent of Americans. Now, it is true that my friend and supporter, Warren Buffett, for example, could afford to pay a little more in taxes in order",2008-10-15,Democrat
Mccain,"Were talking about Joe the plumber. OBAMA:  in order to give  in order to give additional tax cuts to Joe the plumber before he was at the point where he could make $250,000. Then Exxon Mobil, which made $12 billion, record profits, over the last several quarters, they can afford to pay a little more so that ordinary families who are hurting out there  theyre trying to figure out how theyre going to afford food, how theyre going to save for their kids college education, they need a break. So, look, nobody likes taxes. I would prefer that none of us had to pay taxes, including myself. But ultimately, weve got to pay for the core investments that make this economy strong and somebodys got to do it.",2008-10-15,Republican
Mccain,Nobody likes taxes. Lets not raise anybodys taxes. OK?,2008-10-15,Republican
Obama,"Well, I dont mind paying a little more.",2008-10-15,Democrat
Mccain,"The fact is that businesses in America today are paying the second highest tax rate of anywhere in the world. Our tax rate for business in America is 35 percent. Ireland, its 11 percent. We need to cut the business tax rate in America. We need to encourage business. Now, of all times in America, we need to cut peoples taxes. We need to encourage business, create jobs, not spread the wealth around.",2008-10-15,Republican
Schieffer,"All right. Lets go to another topic. Its related. So if you have other things you want to say, you can get back to that. This question goes to you first, Senator Obama. We found out yesterday that this years deficit will reach an astounding record high $455 billion. Some experts say it could go to $1 trillion next year. Both of you have said you want to reduce the deficit, but the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget ran the numbers on both of your proposals and they say the cost of your proposals, even with the savings you claim can be made, each will add more than $200 billion to the deficit. Give us some specifics on what youre going to cut back.",2008-10-15,Moderator
Obama,"Well, first of all, I think its important for the American public to understand that the $750 billion rescue package, if its structured properly, and, as president, I will make sure its structured properly, means that ultimately taxpayers get their money back, and thats important to understand. But there is no doubt that weve been living beyond our means and were going to have to make some adjustments.",2008-10-15,Democrat
Schieffer,"But youre going to have to cut some of these programs, certainly.",2008-10-15,Moderator
Obama,"Absolutely. So let me get to that. What I want to emphasize, though, is that I have been a strong proponent of pay-as- you-go. Every dollar that Ive proposed, Ive proposed an additional cut so that it matches.",2008-10-15,Democrat
Obama,"And some of the cuts, just to give you an example, we spend $15 billion a year on subsidies to insurance companies. It doesnt  under the Medicare plan  it doesnt help seniors get any better. Its not improving our health care system. Its just a giveaway. We need to eliminate a whole host of programs that dont work. And I want to go through the federal budget line by line, page by page, programs that dont work, we should cut. Programs that we need, we should make them work better. Now, what is true is that Senator McCain and I have a difference in terms of the need to invest in America and the American people. I mentioned health care earlier. If we make investments now so that people have coverage, that we are preventing diseases, that will save on Medicare and Medicaid in the future. If we invest in a serious energy policy, that will save in the amount of money were borrowing from China to send to Saudi Arabia. If we invest now in our young people and their ability to go to college, that will allow them to drive this economy into the 21st century. But what is absolutely true is that, once we get through this economic crisis and some of the specific proposals to get us out of this slump, that were not going to be able to go back to our profligate ways. And were going to have to embrace a culture and an ethic of responsibility, all of us, corporations, the federal government, and individuals out there who may be living beyond their means.",2008-10-15,Democrat
Schieffer,Times up.,2008-10-15,Moderator
Mccain,"Well, thank you, Bob. I just want to get back to this home ownership. During the Depression era, we had a thing called the home ownership loan corporation. And they went out and bought up these mortgages. And people were able to stay in their homes, and eventually the values of those homes went up, and they actually made money. And, by the way, this was a proposal made by Senator Clinton not too long ago. So, obviously, if we can start increasing home values, then there will be creation of wealth.",2008-10-15,Republican

Schieffer,"The question was, what are you going to cut?",2008-10-15,Moderator
Mccain,"Energy  well, first  second of all, energy independence. We have to have nuclear power. We have to stop sending $700 billion a year to countries that dont like us very much. Its wind, tide, solar, natural gas, nuclear, off-shore drilling, which Senator Obama has opposed. And the point is that we become energy independent and we will create millions of jobs  millions of jobs in America. Because weve got  we have presided over the largest increase  weve got to have a new direction for this country. We have presided over the largest increase in government since the Great Society. Government spending has gone completely out of control; $10 trillion dollar debt were giving to our kids, a half-a-trillion dollars we owe China. I know how to save billions of dollars in defense spending. I know how to eliminate programs.",2008-10-15,Republican
Schieffer,Which ones?,2008-10-15,Moderator
Mccain,"I have fought against  well, one of them would be the marketing assistance program. Another one would be a number of subsidies for ethanol. I oppose subsidies for ethanol because I thought it distorted the market and created inflation; Senator Obama supported those subsidies. I would eliminate the tariff on imported sugarcane-based ethanol from Brazil. I know how to save billions. I saved the taxpayer $6.8 billion by fighting a deal for a couple of years, as you might recall, that was a sweetheart deal between an aircraft manufacturer, DOD, and people ended up in jail.",2008-10-15,Republican

Obama,"Well, look, I think that we do have a disagreement about an across-the-board spending freeze. It sounds good. Its proposed periodically. It doesnt happen. And, in fact, an across-the-board spending freeze is a hatchet, and we do need a scalpel, because there are some programs that dont work at all. There are some programs that are underfunded. And I want to make sure that we are focused on those programs that work. Now, Senator McCain talks a lot about earmarks. Thats one of the centerpieces of his campaign. Earmarks account for 0.5 percent of the total federal budget. Theres no doubt that the system needs reform and there are a lot of screwy things that we end up spending money on, and they need to be eliminated. But its not going to solve the problem. Now, the last thing I think we have to focus on is a little bit of history, just so that we understand what were doing going forward. When President Bush came into office, we had a budget surplus and the national debt was a little over $5 trillion. It has doubled over the last eight years.",2008-10-15,Democrat
Obama,"And we are now looking at a deficit of well over half a trillion dollars. So one of the things that I think we have to recognize is pursuing the same kinds of policies that we pursued over the last eight years is not going to bring down the deficit. And, frankly, Senator McCain voted for four out of five of President Bushs budgets. Weve got to take this in a new direction, thats what I propose as president.",2008-10-15,Democrat

Mccain,"Yes. Senator Obama, I am not President Bush. If you wanted to run against President Bush, you should have run four years ago. Im going to give a new direction to this economy in this country. Senator Obama talks about voting for budgets. He voted twice for a budget resolution that increases the taxes on individuals making $42,000 a year. Of course, we can take a hatchet and a scalpel to this budget. Its completely out of control.",2008-10-15,Republican

Mccain," reduce this  I can  we can do it with this kind of job creation of energy independence. Now, look, Americans are hurting tonight and theyre angry and I understand that, and they want a new direction. I can bring them in that direction by eliminating spending. Senator Obama talks about the budgets I voted for. He voted for the last two budgets that had that $24 billion more in spending than the budget that the Bush administration proposed. He voted for the energy bill that was full of goodies for the oil companies that I opposed. So the fact is, lets look at our records, Senator Obama. Lets look at it as graded by the National Taxpayers Union and the Citizens Against Government Waste and the other watchdog organizations. I have fought against spending. I have fought against special interests. I have fought for reform. You have to tell me one time when you have stood up with the leaders of your party on one single major issue.",2008-10-15,Republican
Schieffer,Barack.,2008-10-15,Moderator
Obama,"Well, theres a lot of stuff that was put out there, so let me try to address it. First of all, in terms of standing up to the leaders of my party, the first major bill that I voted on in the Senate was in support of tort reform, which wasnt very popular with trial lawyers, a major constituency in the Democratic Party. I support",2008-10-15,Democrat
Mccain,An overwhelming vote.,2008-10-15,Republican
Obama,"I support charter schools and pay for performance for teachers. Doesnt make me popular with the teachers union. I support clean coal technology. Doesnt make me popular with environmentalists. So Ive got a history of reaching across the aisle. Now with respect to a couple of things Senator McCain said, the notion that I voted for a tax increase for people making $42,000 a year has been disputed by everybody who has looked at this claim that Senator McCain keeps on making. Even FOX News disputes it, and that doesnt happen very often when it comes to accusations about me. So the fact of the matter is that if I occasionally have mistaken your policies for George Bushs policies, its because on the core economic issues that matter to the American people, on tax policy, on energy policy, on spending priorities, you have been a vigorous supporter of President Bush. Now, youve shown independence  commendable independence, on some key issues like torture, for example, and I give you enormous credit for that. But when it comes to economic policies, essentially what youre proposing is eight more years of the same thing. And it hasnt worked. And I think the American people understand it hasnt worked.

Whether it be opposition to spending and earmarks, whether it be the issue of torture, whether it be the conduct of the war in Iraq, which I vigorously opposed. Whether it be on fighting the pharmaceutical companies on Medicare prescription drugs, importation. Whether it be fighting for an HMO patients bill of rights.

Senator McCain, your commercials have included words like disrespectful, dangerous, dishonorable, he lied. Your running mate said he palled around with terrorists. And, Senator McCain, youre first.",2008-10-15,Moderator
Mccain,"Well, this has been a tough campaign. Its been a very tough campaign. And I know from my experience in many campaigns that, if Senator Obama had asked  responded to my urgent request to sit down, and do town hall meetings, and come before the American people, we could have done at least 10 of them by now. When Senator Obama was first asked, he said, Any place, any time, the way Barry Goldwater and Jack Kennedy agreed to do, before the intervention of the tragedy at Dallas. So I think the tone of this campaign could have been very different. And the fact is, its gotten pretty tough. And I regret some of the negative aspects of both campaigns. But the fact is that it has taken many turns which I think are unacceptable. One of them happened just the other day, when a man I admire and respect  Ive written about him  Congressman John Lewis, an American hero, made allegations that Sarah Palin and I were somehow associated with the worst chapter in American history, segregation, deaths of children in church bombings, George Wallace. That, to me, was so hurtful. And, Senator Obama, you didnt repudiate those remarks. Every time theres been an out-of-bounds remark made by a Republican, no matter where they are, I have repudiated them. I hope that Senator Obama will repudiate those remarks that were made by Congressman John Lewis, very unfair and totally inappropriate. So I want to tell you, we will run a truthful campaign. This is a tough campaign. And its a matter of fact that Senator Obama has spent more money on negative ads than any political campaign in history. And I can prove it. And, Senator Obama, when he said  and he signed a piece of paper that said he would take public financing for his campaign if I did  that was back when he was a long-shot candidate  you didnt keep your word. And when you looked into the camera in a debate with Senator Clinton and said, I will sit down and negotiate with John McCain about public financing before I make a decision, you didnt tell the American people the truth because you didnt. And thats  thats  thats an unfortunate part. Now we have the highest spending by Senator Obamas campaign than any time since Watergate.",2008-10-15,Republican

And 100 percent, John, of your ads  100 percent of them have been negative.",2008-10-15,Democrat
Mccain,Its not true.,2008-10-15,Republican

And, now, I think the American people are less interested in our hurt feelings during the course of the campaign than addressing the issues that matter to them so deeply. And there is nothing wrong with us having a vigorous debate like were having tonight about health care, about energy policy, about tax policy. Thats the stuff that campaigns should be made of. The notion, though, that because were not doing town hall meetings that justifies some of the ads that have been going up, not just from your own campaign directly, John, but 527s and other organizations that make some pretty tough accusations, well, I dont mind being attacked for the next three weeks. What the American people cant afford, though, is four more years of failed economic policies. And what they deserve over the next four weeks is that we talk about whats most pressing to them: the economic crisis. Senator McCains own campaign said publicly last week that, if we keep on talking about the economic crisis, we lose, so we need to change the subject. And I would love to see the next three weeks devoted to talking about the economy, devoted to talking about health care, devoted to talking about energy, and figuring out how the American people can send their kids to college. And that is something that I would welcome.

So the fact is that Senator Obama is spending unprecedented  unprecedented in the history of American politics, going back to the beginning, amounts of money in negative attack ads on me. And of course, Ive been talking about the economy. Of course, Ive talked to people like Joe the plumber and tell him that Im not going to spread his wealth around.

And, in fact, afterwards, Congressman Lewis put out a similar statement, saying that he had probably gone over the line. The important point here is, though, the American people have become so cynical about our politics, because all they see is a tit- for-tat and back-and-forth.

Obama,"Bob, I think its going to be important to just  Ill respond to these two particular allegations that Senator McCain has made and that have gotten a lot of attention. In fact, Mr. Ayers has become the centerpiece of Senator McCains campaign over the last two or three weeks. This has been their primary focus. So lets get the record straight. Bill Ayers is a professor of education in Chicago. Forty years ago, when I was 8 years old, he engaged in despicable acts with a radical domestic group. I have roundly condemned those acts. Ten years ago he served and I served on a school reform board that was funded by one of Ronald Reagans former ambassadors and close friends, Mr. Annenberg. Other members on that board were the presidents of the University of Illinois, the president of Northwestern University, who happens to be a Republican, the president of The Chicago Tribune, a Republican- leaning newspaper. Mr. Ayers is not involved in my campaign. He has never been involved in this campaign. And he will not advise me in the White House. So thats Mr. Ayers. Now, with respect to ACORN, ACORN is a community organization. Apparently what theyve done is they were paying people to go out and register folks, and apparently some of the people who were out there didnt really register people, they just filled out a bunch of names. It had nothing to do with us. We were not involved. The only involvement Ive had with ACORN was I represented them alongside the U.S. Justice Department in making Illinois implement a motor voter law that helped people get registered at DMVs. Now, the reason I think that its important to just get these facts out is because the allegation that Senator McCain has continually made is that somehow my associations are troubling. Let me tell you who I associate with. On economic policy, I associate with Warren Buffett and former Fed Chairman Paul Volcker. If Im interested in figuring out my foreign policy, I associate myself with my running mate, Joe Biden or with Dick Lugar, the Republican ranking member on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, or General Jim Jones, the former supreme allied commander of NATO. Those are the people, Democrats and Republicans, who have shaped my ideas and who will be surrounding me in the White House. And I think the fact that this has become such an important part of your campaign, Senator McCain, says more about your campaign than it says about me.",2008-10-15,Democrat
Mccain,"Well, again, while you were on the board of the Woods Foundation, you and Mr. Ayers, together, you sent $230,000 to ACORN. So  and you launched your political campaign in Mr. Ayers living room.",2008-10-15,Republican
Obama,Thats absolutely not true.,2008-10-15,Democrat
Mccain,And the facts are facts and records are records.,2008-10-15,Republican
Obama,And thats not the facts.,2008-10-15,Democrat
Mccain,"And its not the fact  its not the fact that Senator Obama chooses to associate with a guy who in 2001 said that he wished he had have bombed more, and he had a long association with him. Its the fact that all the  all of the details need to be known about Senator Obamas relationship with them and with ACORN and the American people will make a judgment. And my campaign is about getting this economy back on track, about creating jobs, about a brighter future for America. And thats what my campaign is about and Im not going to raise taxes the way Senator Obama wants to raise taxes in a tough economy. And thats really what this campaign is going to be about.",2008-10-15,Republican
Schieffer,All right. Lets go to the next topic and you  we may want to get back into some of this during this next discussion. I want to ask both of you about the people that youre going to bring into the government. And our best insight yet is who you have picked as your running mates.,2008-10-15,Moderator
Schieffer,"So Ill begin by asking both of you this question, and Ill ask you to answer first, Senator Obama. Why would the country be better off if your running mate became president rather than his running mate?",2008-10-15,Moderator
Obama,"Well, Joe Biden, I think, is one of the finest public servants that has served in this country. Its not just that he has some of the best foreign policy credentials of anybody. And Democrats and Republicans alike, I think, acknowledge his expertise there. But its also that his entire life he has never forgotten where he came from, coming from Scranton, fighting on behalf of working families, remembering what its like to see his father lose his job and go through a downward spiral economically. And, as a consequence, his consistent pattern throughout his career is to fight for the little guy. Thats what hes done when it comes to economic policies that will help working families get a leg up. Thats what hes done when it comes to, for example, passing the landmark 1994 crime bill, the Violence Against Womens Act. Joe has always made sure that he is fighting on behalf of working families, and I think he shares my core values and my sense of where the country needs to go. Because after eight years of failed policies, he and I both agree that what were going to have to do is to reprioritize, make sure that were investing in the American people, give tax cuts not to the wealthiest corporations, but give them to small businesses and give them to individuals who are struggling right now, make sure that we finally get serious about energy independence, something that has been languishing in Washington for 30 years, and make sure that our kids get a great education and can afford to go to college. So, on the key issues that are of importance to American families, Joe Bidens always been on the right side, and I think he will make an outstanding president if, heaven forbid, something happened to me.",2008-10-15,Democrat

Mccain,"Well, Americans have gotten to know Sarah Palin. They know that shes a role model to women and other  and reformers all over America. Shes a reformer. She is  she took on a governor who was a member of her own party when she ran for governor. When she was the head of their energy and natural resources board, she saw corruption, she resigned and said, This cant go on. Shes given money back to the taxpayers. Shes cut the size of government. She negotiated with the oil companies and faced them down, a $40 billion pipeline of natural gas thats going to relieve the energy needs of the United  of what they call the lower 48. Shes a reformer through and through. And its time we had that bresh of freth air (sic)  breath of fresh air coming into our nations capital and sweep out the old-boy network and the cronyism thats been so much a part of it that Ive fought against for all these years. Shell be my partner. She understands reform. And, by the way, she also understands special-needs families. She understands that autism is on the rise, that weve got to find out whats causing it, and weve got to reach out to these families, and help them, and give them the help they need as they raise these very special needs children. She understands that better than almost any American that I know. Im proud of her. And she has ignited our party and people all over America that have never been involved in the political process. And I cant tell how proud I am of her and her family. Her husbands a pretty tough guy, by the way, too.",2008-10-15,Republican
Schieffer,Do you think shes qualified to be president?,2008-10-15,Moderator
Obama,"You know, I think its  thats going to be up to the American people. I think that, obviously, shes a capable politician who has, I think, excited the  a base in the Republican Party. And I think its very commendable the work shes done on behalf of special needs. I agree with that, John. I do want to just point out that autism, for example, or other special needs will require some additional funding, if were going to get serious in terms of research. That is something that every family that advocates on behalf of disabled children talk about. And if we have an across-the-board spending freeze, were not going to be able to do it. Thats an example of, I think, the kind of use of the scalpel that we want to make sure that were funding some of those programs.",2008-10-15,Democrat
Schieffer,Do you think Senator Biden is qualified?,2008-10-15,Moderator
Mccain,"I think that Joe Biden is qualified in many respects. But I do point out that hes been wrong on many foreign policy and national security issues, which is supposed to be his strength. He voted against the first Gulf War. He voted against it and, obviously, we had to take Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait or it wouldve threatened the Middle Eastern world supply. In Iraq, he had this cockamamie idea about dividing Iraq into three countries. Were seeing Iraq united as Iraqis, tough, hard, but were seeing them. Were now about to have an agreement for status of forces in Iraq coming up. There are several issues in which, frankly, Joe Biden and I openly and honestly disagreed on national security policy, and hes been wrong on a number of the major ones. Why cant we have transparency, accountability, reform of these agencies of government? Maybe thats why hes asked for 860  sought and proposed $860 billion worth of new spending and wants to raise peoples taxes in a time of incredible challenge and difficulty and heartache for the American families.",2008-10-15,Republican
Schieffer,Lets go to  lets go to a new topic. Were running a little behind.,2008-10-15,Moderator
Mccain,Climate change.,2008-10-15,Republican
Schieffer,"Climate change, yes  has said what both of you have said, and, that is, we must reduce our dependence on foreign oil. When Nixon said it, we imported from 17 to 34 percent of our foreign oil. Now, were importing more than 60 percent. And I believe the first question goes to you, Senator McCain. MCCAIN: I believe we can, for all intents and purposes, eliminate our dependence on Middle Eastern oil and Venezuelan oil. Canadian oil is fine. By the way, when Senator Obama said he would unilaterally renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement, the Canadians said, Yes, and well sell our oil to China. You dont tell countries youre going to unilaterally renegotiate agreements with them. We can eliminate our dependence on foreign oil by building 45 new nuclear plants, power plants, right away. We can store and we can reprocess. Senator Obama will tell you, in the  as the extreme environmentalists do, it has to be safe. Look, weve sailed Navy ships around the world for 60 years with nuclear power plants on them. We can store and reprocess spent nuclear fuel, Senator Obama, no problem. So the point is with nuclear power, with wind, tide, solar, natural gas, with development of flex fuel, hybrid, clean coal technology, clean coal technology is key in the heartland of America thats hurting rather badly. So I think we can easily, within seven, eight, ten years, if we put our minds to it, we can eliminate our dependence on the places in the world that harm our national security if we dont achieve our independence.",2008-10-15,Moderator
Schieffer,"All right. Can we reduce our dependence on foreign oil and by how much in the first term, in four years?",2008-10-15,Moderator
Obama,"I think that in ten years, we can reduce our dependence so that we no longer have to import oil from the Middle East or Venezuela. I think thats about a realistic timeframe. And this is the most important issue that our future economy is going to face. Obviously, weve got an immediate crisis right now. But nothing is more important than us no longer borrowing $700 billion or more from China and sending it to Saudi Arabia. Its mortgaging our childrens future. Now, from the start of this campaign, Ive identified this as one of my top priorities and here is what I think we have to do. Number one, we do need to expand domestic production and that means, for example, telling the oil companies the 68 million acres that they currently have leased that theyre not drilling, use them or lose them. And I think that we should look at offshore drilling and implement it in a way that allows us to get some additional oil. But understand, we only have three to four percent of the worlds oil reserves and we use 25 percent of the worlds oil, which means that we cant drill our way out of the problem. Thats why Ive focused on putting resources into solar, wind, biodiesel, geothermal. These have been priorities of mine since I got to the Senate, and it is absolutely critical that we develop a high fuel efficient car thats built not in Japan and not in South Korea, but built here in the United States of America. We invented the auto industry and the fact that we have fallen so far behind is something that we have to work on.",2008-10-15,Democrat
Obama,"Now I just want to make one last point because Senator McCain mentioned NAFTA and the issue of trade and that actually bears on this issue. I believe in free trade. But I also believe that for far too long, certainly during the course of the Bush administration with the support of Senator McCain, the attitude has been that any trade agreement is a good trade agreement. And NAFTA doesnt have  did not have enforceable labor agreements and environmental agreements. And what I said was we should include those and make them enforceable. In the same way that we should enforce rules against China manipulating its currency to make our exports more expensive and their exports to us cheaper. And when it comes to South Korea, weve got a trade agreement up right now, they are sending hundreds of thousands of South Korean cars into the United States. Thats all good. We can only get 4,000 to 5,000 into South Korea. That is not free trade. Weve got to have a president who is going to be advocating on behalf of American businesses and American workers and I make no apology for that.",2008-10-15,Democrat
Schieffer,Senator?,2008-10-15,Moderator
Mccain,"Well, you know, I admire so much Senator Obamas eloquence. And you really have to pay attention to words. He said, we will look at offshore drilling. Did you get that? Look at. We can offshore drill now. Weve got to do it now. We will reduce the cost of a barrel of oil because we show the world that we have a supply of our own. Its doable. The technology is there and we have to drill now. Now, on the subject of free trade agreements. I am a free trader. And I need  we need to have education and training programs for displaced workers that work, going to our community colleges. But let me give you another example of a free trade agreement that Senator Obama opposes. Right now, because of previous agreements, some made by President Clinton, the goods and products that we send to Colombia, which is our largest agricultural importer of our products, is  theres a billion dollars that we  our businesses have paid so far in order to get our goods in there. Because of previous agreements, their goods and products come into our country for free. So Senator Obama, who has never traveled south of our border, opposes the Colombia Free Trade Agreement. The same country thats helping us try to stop the flow of drugs into our country thats killing young Americans. And also the country that just freed three Americans that will help us create jobs in America because they will be a market for our goods and products without having to pay  without us having to pay the billions of dollars  the billion dollars and more that weve already paid. Free trade with Colombia is something thats a no-brainer. But maybe you ought to travel down there and visit them and maybe you could understand it a lot better.",2008-10-15,Republican
Obama,"Let me respond. Actually, I understand it pretty well. The history in Colombia right now is that labor leaders have been targeted for assassination on a fairly consistent basis and there have not been prosecutions. And what I have said, because the free trade  the trade agreement itself does have labor and environmental protections, but we have to stand for human rights and we have to make sure that violence isnt being perpetrated against workers who are just trying to organize for their rights, which is why, for example, I supported the Peruvian Free Trade Agreement which was a well-structured agreement. But I think that the important point is weve got to have a president who understands the benefits of free trade but also is going to enforce unfair trade agreements and is going to stand up to other countries. And the last point Ill make, because we started on energy. When I talked about the automakers, they are obviously getting hammered right now. They were already having a tough time because of high gas prices. And now with the financial crisis, car dealerships are closing and people cant get car loans. Thats why I think its important for us to get loan guarantees to the automakers, but we do have to hold them responsible as well to start producing the highly fuel-efficient cars of the future. And Detroit had dragged its feet too long in terms of getting that done. Its going to be one of my highest priorities because transportation accounts for about 30 percent of our total energy consumption. If we can get that right, then we can move in a direction not only of energy independence, but we can create 5 million new jobs all across America, including in the heartland where we can retool some of these plants to make these highly fuel-efficient cars and also to make wind turbines and solar panels, the kinds of clean energy approaches that should be the driver of our economy for the next century.",2008-10-15,Democrat
Mccain,"Well, let me just said that that this is  he  Senator Obama doesnt want a free trade agreement with our best ally in the region but wants to sit down across the table without precondition to  with Hugo Chavez, the guy who has been helping FARC, the terrorist organization. Free trade between ourselves and Colombia, I just recited to you the benefits of concluding that agreement, a billion dollars of American dollars that could have gone to creating jobs and businesses in the United States, opening up those markets. So I dont  I dont think theres any doubt that Senator Obama wants to restrict trade and he wants to raise taxes. And the last president of the United States that tried that was Herbert Hoover, and we went from a deep recession into a depression. Were not going to follow that path while Im  when Im president of the United States.",2008-10-15,Republican
Schieffer,"All right, lets go to a new topic, health care. Given the current economic situation, would either of you now favor controlling health care costs over expanding health care coverage? The question is first to Senator Obama.",2008-10-15,Moderator
Obama,"Weve got to do both, and thats exactly what my plan does. Look, as I travel around the country, this is the issue that will break your heart over and over again. Just yesterday, I was in Toledo shaking some hands in a line. Two women, both of them probably in their mid- to late-50s, had just been laid off of their plant. Neither of them have health insurance. And they were desperate for some way of getting coverage, because, understandably, theyre worried that, if they get sick, they could go bankrupt. So heres what my plan does. If you have health insurance, then you dont have to do anything. If youve got health insurance through your employer, you can keep your health insurance, keep your choice of doctor, keep your plan. The only thing were going to try to do is lower costs so that those cost savings are passed onto you. And we estimate we can cut the average familys premium by about $2,500 per year. If you dont have health insurance, then what were going to do is to provide you the option of buying into the same kind of federal pool that both Senator McCain and I enjoy as federal employees, which will give you high-quality care, choice of doctors, at lower costs, because so many people are part of this insured group. Were going to make sure that insurance companies cant discriminate on the basis of pre-existing conditions. Well negotiate with the drug companies for the cheapest available price on drugs. We are going to invest in information technology to eliminate bureaucracy and make the system more efficient. And we are going to make sure that we manage chronic illnesses, like diabetes and heart disease, that cost a huge amount, but could be prevented. Weve got to put more money into preventive care. This will cost some money on the front end, but over the long term this is the only way that not only are we going to make families healthy, but its also how were going to save the federal budget, because we cant afford these escalating costs.",2008-10-15,Democrat
Schieffer,All right.,2008-10-15,Moderator
Mccain,"Well, it is a terribly painful situation for Americans. Theyre seeing their premiums, their co-pays go up. Forty-seven million Americans are without health insurance in America today. And it really is the cost, the escalating costs of health care that are inflicting such pain on working families and people across this country. And I am convinced we need to do a lot of things. We need to put health care records online. The V.A. does that. That will  that will reduce costs. We need to have more community health centers. We need to have walk-in clinics. The rise of obesity amongst young Americans is one of the most alarming statistics that there is. We should have physical fitness programs and nutrition programs in schools. Every parent should know whats going on there. We  we need to have  we need to have employers reward employees who join health clubs and practice wellness and fitness. But I want to give every American family a $5,000 refundable tax credit. Take it and get anywhere in America the health care that you wish. Now, my old buddy, Joe, Joe the plumber, is out there. Now, Joe, Senator Obamas plan, if youre a small business and you are able  and your  the guy that sells to you will not have his capital gains tax increase, which Senator Obama wants, if youre out there, my friend, and youve got employees, and youve got kids, if you dont get  adopt the health care plan that Senator Obama mandates, hes going to fine you.",2008-10-15,Republican
Mccain,"Now, Senator Obama, Id like  still like to know what that fine is going to be, and I dont think that Joe right now wants to pay a fine when he is seeing such difficult times in Americas economy. Senator Obama wants to set up health care bureaucracies, take over the health care of America through  as he said, his object is a single payer system.",2008-10-15,Republican

Obama,I just,2008-10-15,Democrat
Mccain,Excuse me.,2008-10-15,Republican

Mccain,Zero?,2008-10-15,Republican
Obama,"Zero, because as I said in our last debate and Ill repeat, John, I exempt small businesses from the requirement for large businesses that can afford to provide health care to their employees, but are not doing it. I exempt small businesses from having to pay into a kitty. But large businesses that can afford it, weve got a choice. Either they provide health insurance to their employees or somebody has to. Right now, what happens is those employees get dumped into either the Medicaid system, which taxpayers pick up, or theyre going to the emergency room for uncompensated care, which everybody picks up in their premiums. The average family is paying an additional $900 a year in higher premiums because of the uninsured. So heres what we do. We exempt small businesses. In fact, what, Joe, if you want to do the right thing with your employees and you want to provide them health insurance, well give you a 50 percent credit so that you will actually be able to afford it. If you dont have health insurance or you want to buy into a group plan, you will be able to buy into the plan that I just described. Now, what we havent talked about is Senator McCains plan. He says hes going to give you all a $5,000 tax credit. That sounds pretty good. And you can go out and buy your own insurance. Heres the problem  that for about 20 million people, you may find yourselves no longer having employer-based health insurance. This is because younger people might be able to get health insurance for $5,000, young and healthy folks. Older folks, less healthy folks, whats going to end up happening is that youre going to be the only ones left in your employer-based system, your employers wont be able to afford it. And once youre out on your own with this $5,000 credit, Senator McCain, for the first time, is going to be taxing the health care benefits that you have from your employer. And this is your plan, John. For the first time in history, you will be taxing peoples health care benefits. By the way, the average policy costs about $12,000. So if youve got $5,000 and its going to cost you $12,000, thats a loss for you. Last point about Senator McCains plan is that insurers right now, the main restrictions on what they do is primarily state law and, under Senator McCains plan, those rules would be stripped away and you would start seeing a lot more insurance companies cherry-picking and excluding people from coverage. That, I think, is a mistake and I think that this is a fundamental difference in our campaign and how we would approach health care.",2008-10-15,Democrat
Schieffer,What about that?,2008-10-15,Moderator
Mccain,"Hey, Joe, youre rich, congratulations, because what Joe wanted to do was buy the business that hes been working for 10-12 hours a day, seven days a week, and you said that you wanted to spread the wealth, but  in other words, take Joes money and then you decide what to do with it. Now, Joe, youre rich, congratulations, and you will then fall into the category where youll have to pay a fine if you dont provide health insurance that Senator Obama mandates, not the kind that you think is best for your family, your children, your employees, but the kind that he mandates for you. Thats big government at its best. Now, 95 percent of the people in America will receive more money under my plan because they will receive not only their present benefits, which may be taxed, which will be taxed, but then you add $5,000 onto it, except for those people who have the gold-plated Cadillac insurance policies that have to do with cosmetic surgery and transplants and all of those kinds of things. And the good thing about this is theyll be able to go across America. The average cost of a health care insurance plan in America today is $5,800. Im going to give them $5,000 to take with them wherever they want to go, and this will give them affordability. This will give them availability. This will give them a chance to choose their own futures, not have Senator Obama and government decide that for them. This really gets down to the fundamental difference in our philosophies. If you notice that in all of this proposal, Senator  government wants  Senator Obama wants government to do the job. Senator Obama wants government to do the job. I want, Joe, you to do the job.",2008-10-15,Republican
Mccain,"I want to leave money in your pocket. I want you to be able to choose the health care for you and your family. Thats what Im all about. And weve got too much government and too much spending and the government is  the size of government has grown by 40 percent in the last eight years. We cant afford that in the next eight years and Senator Obama, with the Democrats in charge of Congress, things have gotten worse. Have you noticed, theyve been in charge the last two years.",2008-10-15,Republican
Schieffer,All right. A short response.,2008-10-15,Moderator
Obama,"Very briefly. You all just heard my plan. If youve got an employer-based health care plan, you keep it. Now, under Senator McCains plan there is a strong risk that people would lose their employer-based health care. Thats the choice youll have is having your employer no longer provide you health care. And dont take my word for it. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which generally doesnt support a lot of Democrats, said that this plan could lead to the unraveling of the employer-based health care system. All I want to do, if youve already got health care, is lower your costs. That includes you, Joe.",2008-10-15,Democrat
Schieffer,"All right. Lets stop there and go to another question. And this one goes to Senator McCain. Senator McCain, you believe Roe v. Wade should be overturned. Senator Obama, you believe it shouldnt.",2008-10-15,Moderator
Mccain,I would never and have never in all the years Ive been there imposed a litmus test on any nominee to the court. Thats not appropriate to do.,2008-10-15,Republican
Schieffer,But you dont want Roe v. Wade to be overturned?,2008-10-15,Moderator
Mccain,"I thought it was a bad decision. I think there were a lot of decisions that were bad. I think that decisions should rest in the hands of the states. Im a federalist. And I believe strongly that we should have nominees to the United States Supreme Court based on their qualifications rather than any litmus test. Now, let me say that there was a time a few years ago when the United States Senate was about to blow up. Republicans wanted to have just a majority vote to confirm a judge and the Democrats were blocking in an unprecedented fashion. We got together seven Republicans, seven Democrats. You were offered a chance to join. You chose not to because you were afraid of the appointment of, quote, conservative judges. I voted for Justice Breyer and Justice Ginsburg. Not because I agreed with their ideology, but because I thought they were qualified and that elections have consequences when presidents are nominated. This is a very important issue were talking about. Senator Obama voted against Justice Breyer and Justice Roberts on the grounds that they didnt meet his ideological standards. Thats not the way we should judge these nominees. Elections have consequences. They should be judged on their qualifications. And so thats what I will do. I will find the best people in the world  in the United States of America who have a history of strict adherence to the Constitution. And not legislating from the bench.",2008-10-15,Republican
Schieffer,"But even if it was someone  even someone who had a history of being for abortion rights, you would consider them?",2008-10-15,Moderator
Mccain,I would consider anyone in their qualifications. I do not believe that someone who has supported Roe v. Wade that would be part of those qualifications. But I certainly would not impose any litmus test.,2008-10-15,Republican
Schieffer,All right.,2008-10-15,Moderator
Obama,"Well, I think its true that we shouldnt apply a strict litmus test and the most important thing in any judge is their capacity to provide fairness and justice to the American people. And it is true that this is going to be, I think, one of the most consequential decisions of the next president. It is very likely that one of us will be making at least one and probably more than one appointments and Roe versus Wade probably hangs in the balance. Now I would not provide a litmus test. But I am somebody who believes that Roe versus Wade was rightly decided. I think that abortion is a very difficult issue and it is a moral issue and one that I think good people on both sides can disagree on. But what ultimately I believe is that women in consultation with their families, their doctors, their religious advisers, are in the best position to make this decision. And I think that the Constitution has a right to privacy in it that shouldnt be subject to state referendum, any more than our First Amendment rights are subject to state referendum, any more than many of the other rights that we have should be subject to popular vote.",2008-10-15,Democrat
Obama,"So this is going to be an important issue. I will look for those judges who have an outstanding judicial record, who have the intellect, and who hopefully have a sense of what real-world folks are going through. Ill just give you one quick example. Senator McCain and I disagreed recently when the Supreme Court made it more difficult for a woman named Lilly Ledbetter to press her claim for pay discrimination. For years, she had been getting paid less than a man had been paid for doing the exact same job. And when she brought a suit, saying equal pay for equal work, the judges said, well, you know, its taken you too long to bring this lawsuit, even though she didnt know about it until fairly recently. We tried to overturn it in the Senate. I supported that effort to provide better guidance to the courts; John McCain opposed it. I think that its important for judges to understand that if a woman is out there trying to raise a family, trying to support her family, and is being treated unfairly, then the court has to stand up, if nobody else will. And thats the kind of judge that I want.",2008-10-15,Democrat
Schieffer,Times up.,2008-10-15,Moderator
Mccain,"Obviously, that law waived the statute of limitations, which you could have gone back 20 or 30 years. It was a trial lawyers dream. Let me talk to you about an important aspect of this issue. We have to change the culture of America. Those of us who are proudly pro-life understand that. And its got to be courage and compassion that we show to a young woman whos facing this terribly difficult decision. Senator Obama, as a member of the Illinois State Senate, voted in the Judiciary Committee against a law that would provide immediate medical attention to a child born of a failed abortion. He voted against that. And then, on the floor of the State Senate, as he did 130 times as a state senator, he voted present. Then there was another bill before the Senate Judiciary Committee in the state of Illinois not that long ago, where he voted against a ban on partial-birth abortion, one of the late-term abortion, a really  one of the bad procedures, a terrible. And then, on the floor of the Illinois State Senate, he voted present. I dont know how you vote present on some of that. I dont know how you align yourself with the extreme aspect of the pro- abortion movement in America. And thats his record, and thats a matter of his record. And hell say it has something to do with Roe v. Wade, about the Illinois State Senate. It was clear-cut votes that Senator Obama voted, I think, in direct contradiction to the feelings and views of mainstream America.",2008-10-15,Republican
Schieffer,Response?,2008-10-15,Moderator
Obama,"Yes, let me respond to this. If it sounds incredible that I would vote to withhold lifesaving treatment from an infant, thats because its not true. The  here are the facts. There was a bill that was put forward before the Illinois Senate that said you have to provide lifesaving treatment and that would have helped to undermine Roe v. Wade. The fact is that there was already a law on the books in Illinois that required providing lifesaving treatment, which is why not only myself but pro-choice Republicans and Democrats voted against it. And the Illinois Medical Society, the organization of doctors in Illinois, voted against it. Their Hippocratic Oath would have required them to provide care, and there was already a law in the books. With respect to partial-birth abortion, I am completely supportive of a ban on late-term abortions, partial-birth or otherwise, as long as theres an exception for the mothers health and life, and this did not contain that exception. And I attempted, as many have in the past, of including that so that it is constitutional. And that was rejected, and thats why I voted present, because Im willing to support a ban on late-term abortions as long as we have that exception. The last point I want to make on the issue of abortion. This is an issue that  look, it divides us. And in some ways, it may be difficult to  to reconcile the two views. But there surely is some common ground when both those who believe in choice and those who are opposed to abortion can come together and say, We should try to prevent unintended pregnancies by providing appropriate education to our youth, communicating that sexuality is sacred and that they should not be engaged in cavalier activity, and providing options for adoption, and helping single mothers if they want to choose to keep the baby. Those are all things that we put in the Democratic platform for the first time this year, and I think thats where we can find some common ground, because nobodys pro-abortion. I think its always a tragic situation.",2008-10-15,Democrat

Schieffer,Lets give Senator McCain a short response,2008-10-15,Moderator
Mccain,Just again,2008-10-15,Republican
Schieffer, and then,2008-10-15,Moderator
Mccain,"Just again, the example of the eloquence of Senator Obama. Hes health for the mother. You know, thats been stretched by the pro-abortion movement in America to mean almost anything. Thats the extreme pro-abortion position, quote, health. But, look, Cindy and I are adoptive parents. We know what a treasure and joy it is to have an adopted child in our lives. Well do everything we can to improve adoption in this country. But that does not mean that we will cease to protect the rights of the unborn. Of course, we have to come together. Of course, we have to work together, and, of course, its vital that we do so and help these young women who are facing such a difficult decision, with a compassion, that well help them with the adoptive services, with the courage to bring that child into this world and well help take care of it.",2008-10-15,Republican
Schieffer,"Lets stop there, because I want to get in a question on education and Im afraid this is going to have to be our last question, gentlemen. The question is this: the U.S. spends more per capita than any other country on education. Yet, by every international measurement, in math and science competence, from kindergarten through the 12th grade, we trail most of the countries of the world. The implications of this are clearly obvious. Some even say it poses a threat to our national security. The question to Senator Obama first.",2008-10-15,Moderator
Obama,"This probably has more to do with our economic future than anything and that means it also has a national security implication, because theres never been a nation on earth that saw its economy decline and continued to maintain its primacy as a military power. So weve got to get our education system right. Now, typically, whats happened is that theres been a debate between more money or reform, and I think we need both. In some cases, we are going to have to invest. Early childhood education, which closes the achievement gap, so that every child is prepared for school, every dollar we invest in that, we end up getting huge benefits with improved reading scores, reduced dropout rates, reduced delinquency rates. I think its going to be critically important for us to recruit a generation of new teachers, an army of new teachers, especially in math and science, give them higher pay, give them more professional development and support in exchange for higher standards and accountability. And I think its important for us to make college affordable. Right now, I meet young people all across the country who either have decided not to go to college or if theyre going to college, they are taking on $20,000, $30,000, $50,000, $60,000 worth of debt, and its very difficult for them to go into some fields, like basic research in science, for example, thinking to themselves that theyre going to have a mortgage before they even buy a house. And thats why Ive proposed a $4,000 tuition credit, every student, every year, in exchange for some form of community service, whether its military service, whether its Peace Corps, whether its working in a community. If we do those things, then I believe that we can create a better school system. But theres one last ingredient that I just want to mention, and thats parents. We cant do it just in the schools. Parents are going to have to show more responsibility. Theyve got to turn off the TV set, put away the video games, and, finally, start instilling that thirst for knowledge that our students need.",2008-10-15,Democrat
Schieffer,Senator McCain?,2008-10-15,Moderator
Mccain,"Well, its the civil rights issue of the 21st century. Theres no doubt that we have achieved equal access to schools in America after a long and difficult and terrible struggle. So choice and competition amongst schools is one of the key elements thats already been proven in places in like New Orleans and New York City and other places, where we have charter schools, where we take good teachers and we reward them and promote them. And we find bad teachers another line of work. And we have to be able to give parents the same choice, frankly, that Senator Obama and Mrs. Obama had and Cindy and I had to send our kids to the school  their kids to the school of their choice. Charter schools arent the only answer, but theyre providing competition. They are providing the kind of competitions that have upgraded both schools  types of schools. Now, throwing money at the problem is not the answer. You will find that some of the worst school systems in America get the most money per student. So I believe that we need to reward these good teachers.",2008-10-15,Republican
Mccain,"We need to encourage programs such as Teach for America and Troops to Teachers where people, after having served in the military, can go right to teaching and not have to take these examinations which  or have the certification that some are required in some states. Look, we must improve education in this country. As far as college education is concerned, we need to make those student loans available. We need to give them a repayment schedule that they can meet. We need to have full student loan program for in-state tuition. And we certainly need to adjust the certain loan eligibility to inflation.",2008-10-15,Republican
Schieffer,"Do you think the federal government should play a larger role in the schools? And I mean, more federal money?",2008-10-15,Moderator
Obama,"Well, we have a tradition of local control of the schools and thats a tradition that has served us well. But I do think that it is important for the federal government to step up and help local school districts do some of the things they need to do. Now we tried to do this under President Bush. He put forward No Child Left Behind. Unfortunately, they left the money behind for No Child Left Behind. And local school districts end up having more of a burden, a bunch of unfunded mandates, the same kind of thing that happened with special education where we did the right thing by saying every school should provide education to kids with special needs, but we never followed through on the promise of funding, and that left local school districts very cash-strapped. So what I want to do is focus on early childhood education, providing teachers higher salaries in exchange for more support. Senator McCain and I actually agree on two things that he just mentioned. Charter schools, I doubled the number of charter schools in Illinois despite some reservations from teachers unions. I think its important to foster competition inside the public schools. And we also agree on the need for making sure that if we have bad teachers that they are swiftly  after given an opportunity to prove themselves, if they cant hack it, then we need to move on because our kids have to have their best future. Where we disagree is on the idea that we can somehow give out vouchers  give vouchers as a way of securing the problems in our education system. And I also have to disagree on Senator McCains record when it comes to college accessibility and affordability. Recently his key economic adviser was asked about why he didnt seem to have some specific programs to help young people go to college and the response was, well, you know, we cant give money to every interest group that comes along. I dont think Americas youth are interest groups, I think theyre our future. And this is an example of where we are going to have to prioritize. We cant say were going to do things and then not explain in concrete terms how were going to pay for it. And if were going to do some of the things you mentioned, like lowering loan rates or what have you, somebody has got to pay for it. Its not going to happen on its own.",2008-10-15,Democrat
Schieffer,"What about that, Senator?",2008-10-15,Moderator
Mccain,"Well, sure. Im sure youre aware, Senator Obama, of the program in the Washington, D.C., school system where vouchers are provided and theres a certain number, I think its a thousand and some and some 9,000 parents asked to be eligible for that. Because they wanted to have the same choice that you and I and Cindy and your wife have had. And that is because they wanted to choose the school that they thought was best for their children. And we all know the state of the Washington, D.C., school system. That was vouchers. That was vouchers, Senator Obama. And Im frankly surprised you didnt pay more attention to that example. Now as far as the No Child Left Behind is concerned, it was a great first beginning in my view. It had its flaws, it had its problems, the first time we had looked at the issue of education in America from a nationwide perspective. And we need to fix a lot of the problems. We need to sit down and reauthorize it. But, again, spending more money isnt always the answer. I think the Head Start program is a great program. A lot of people, including me, said, look, its not doing what it should do. By the third grade many times children who were in the Head Start program arent any better off than the others. Lets reform it. Lets reform it and fund it. That was, of course, out-of-bounds by the Democrats. We need to reform these programs. We need to have transparency. We need to have rewards. Its a system that cries out for accountability and transparency and the adequate funding. And I just said to you earlier, town hall meeting after town hall meeting, parents come with kids, children  precious children who have autism. Sarah Palin knows about that better than most. And well find and well spend the money, research, to find the cause of autism. And well care for these young children. And all Americans will open their wallets and their hearts to do so.",2008-10-15,Republican
Mccain,"But to have a situation, as you mentioned in our earlier comments, that the most expensive education in the world is in the United States of America also means that it cries out for reform, as well. And I will support those reforms, and I will fund the ones that are reformed. But Im not going to continue to throw money at a problem. And Ive got to tell you that vouchers, where they are requested and where they are agreed to, are a good and workable system. And its been proven.",2008-10-15,Republican
Obama,"Ill just make a quick comment about vouchers in D.C. Senator McCains absolutely right: The D.C. school system is in terrible shape, and it has been for a very long time. And weve got a wonderful new superintendent there whos working very hard with the young mayor there to try",2008-10-15,Democrat

Obama,"But the  but heres the thing, is that, even if Senator McCain were to say that vouchers were the way to go  I disagree with him on this, because the data doesnt show that it actually solves the problem  the centerpiece of Senator McCains education policy is to increase the voucher program in D.C. by 2,000 slots. That leaves all of you who live in the other 50 states without an education reform policy from Senator McCain. So if we are going to be serious about this issue, weve got to have a president who is going to tackle it head-on. And thats what I intend to do as president.",2008-10-15,Democrat

Mccain,"Well, thank you again, Bob. Thanks to Hofstra. And its great to be with you again. I think weve had a very healthy discussion. My friends, as I said in my opening remarks, these are very difficult times and challenges for America. And they were graphically demonstrated again today. America needs a new direction. We cannot be satisfied with what weve been doing for the last eight years. I have a record of reform, and taking on my party, the other party, the special interests, whether it be an HMO Patients Bill of Rights, or trying to clean up the campaign finance system in  in this country, or whether it be establishment of a 9/11 Commission, I have a long record of it. And Ive been a careful steward of your tax dollars. We have to make health care affordable and available. We have to make quality education there for all of our citizens, not just the privileged few. We have to stop the spending. We have to stop the spending, which has mortgaged your childrens futures. All of these things and all the promises and commitments that Senator Obama and I made (inaudible) made to you tonight will base  will be based on whether you can trust us or not to be careful stewards of your tax dollar, to make sure America is safe and secure and prosperous, to make sure we reform the institutions of government. Thats why Ive asked you not only to examine my record, but my proposals for the future of this country. Ive spent my entire life in the service of this nation and putting my country first. Theres a long line of McCains that have served our country for a long time in war and in peace, its been the great honor of my life, and Ive been proud to serve. And I hope youll give me an opportunity to serve again. Id be honored and humbled.",2008-10-15,Republican
Schieffer,Senator?,2008-10-15,Moderator
Obama,"Well, I want to thank Senator McCain and Bob for moderating. I think we all know America is going through tough times right now. The policies of the last eight years and  and Washingtons unwillingness to tackle the tough problems for decades has left us in the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. And thats why the biggest risk we could take right now is to adopt the same failed policies and the same failed politics that weve seen over the last eight years and somehow expect a different result. We need fundamental change in this country, and thats what Id like to bring. You know, over the last 20 months, youve invited me into your homes. Youve shared your stories with me. And youve confirmed once again the fundamental decency and generosity of the American people. And thats why Im sure that our brighter days are still ahead. But were going to have to invest in the American people again, in tax cuts for the middle class, in health care for all Americans, and college for every young person who wants to go. In businesses that can create the new energy economy of the future. In policies that will lift wages and will grow our middle class. These are the policies I have fought for my entire career. And these are the policies I want to bring to the White House. But its not going to be easy. Its not going to be quick. It is going to be requiring all of us  Democrats, Republicans, independents  to come together and to renew a spirit of sacrifice and service and responsibility. Im absolutely convinced we can do it. I would ask for your vote, and I promise you that if you give me the extraordinary honor of serving as your president, I will work every single day, tirelessly, on your behalf and on the behalf of the future of our children.

Vanocur,"Thank you, Dorothy. A few words about the order of our format tonight. The order of questioning was determined by a toss of the coin. Congresswoman Ferraro won the toss. She elected to speak last. Therefore Vice President Bush will get the first question. The debate will be built upon a series of questions from the four reporters on the panel. A reporter will ask a candidate a question, a follow-up question and then the same to the other candidate; then each candidate will get to rebut the other. The debate will be divided into two parts. Therell be a section, the first: one, on domestic affairs; the second on foreign affairs. Now the manner of address was decided by the candidates. Therefore it will be Vice President Bush, Congresswoman Ferraro. And we begin our questioning with Mr. Mashek.",1984-10-11,Moderator
Mashek,"John Adams, our nations first vice-president, once said: Today I am nothing. Tomorrow I may be everything. With that in mind, Id like to ask the following question: Vice President Bush, four years ago, you ran against Mr. Reagan for the Republican nomination. You disagreed with him on such issues as the Equal Rights Amendment, abortion, and you labeled his economic policies as voodoo. Now you apparently agree with him on every issue. If you should be called upon to assume the presidency, would you follow Mr. Reagans policies down the line or would you revert to some of your own ideas.",1984-10-11,Moderator
Bush,"Well, I dont think theres a great difference, Mr. Mashek, between my views and President Reagans. One of the reasons I think were an effective team is that I believe firmly in his leadership. Hes really turned this country around. We agree on the economic program. When we came into office, why, inflation was 21, 12 1/2 percent interest was wiping out every single American were 21 1/2 percent if you can believe it. Productivity was down. Savings was down. There was despair. In fact, the leadership of the country told the people that there was a malaise out there. And this president turned it around and Ive been with him every step of the way. And of course I would continue those kinds of programs because its brought America back. Americas better off. People are going back to work. And why Mr. Monad cant understand that theres a new enthusiasm in this country, that America is back, theres new strong leadership, I dont know. He has one answer to the problem. Raise everybodys taxes. He looked right into that lens and he said out there in San Francisco, he said, Im gonna raise your taxes. Well hes had a lot of experience in that and hes sure gonna go ahead and do it. But I remember a statement of Lyndon Johnsons when he was looking around, why his party people werent supporting him, and he said, Hey, they painted their tails white and they ran with the antelopes. Theres a lot of Democratic white tails running with the antelopes. Not one single Democrat has introduced the Mondale tax bill into the Congress. Of course I support the presidents economic program and I support him in everything else. And Im not sure, because of my concept of the vice presidency, that if I didnt, Id go doing what Mr. Mondale has done with Jimmy Carter; jump away from him. I couldnt do that to Ronald Reagan, now, next year or any other time. I have too much trust in him. I have too much friendship for him. And Id feel very uncomfortable doing that.",1984-10-11,Republican
Mashek,"Well some Republicans have criticized Mr. Mondale for now claiming he disagreed privately with Jimmy Carters decision to impose the grain embargo. Have you ever disagreed with any decision of the Reagan Administration and its inner circles? And in following that up, where in your judgment does loyalty end and principle begin?",1984-10-11,Moderator
Bush,"I owe my president my judgment and then I owe him loyalty. You cant have the president of the United States out there looking over his shoulder wondering whether his vice president is going to be supporting him. Mrs. Ferraro has quite a few differences with Vice-President Mondale and I understood it when she changed her position on tuition tax credits. Theyre different on busing; she voted to extend the grain embargo; he now says that he was against it. If they win  and I hope they dont  but if they win, shell have to accommodate some views. But shell give him the same kind of loyalty that Im giving President Reagan. One, were not far apart on anything. Two, I can walk into that Oval Office anytime and give him my judgment and he might agree or he might not. But he also knows I wont be talking about it to the press or I wont be knifing him in the back by leaking to make me look good and complicate the problems of the president of the United States.",1984-10-11,Republican
Mashek,"Congresswoman Ferraro, your opponent has served in the House Of Representatives, hes been ambassador to the United Nations, ambassador to China, director of the Central Intelligence Agency and now hes been vice president for four years. How does your three terms in the House of Representatives stack up against experience like that?",1984-10-11,Moderator
Ferraro,"Well, let me first say that I wasnt born at the age of forty-three when I entered Congress. I did have a life before that as well. I was a prosecutor for almost five years in the district attorneys office in Queens County and I was a teacher. Theres not only what is on your paper resume that makes you qualified to run for or to hold office. Its how you approach problems and what your values are. I think if one is taking a look at my career theyll see that I level with the people; that I approach problems analytically; that I am able to assess the various facts with reference to a problem, and I can make the hard decisions. Im intrigued when I hear Vice-President Bush talk about his support of the presidents economic program and how everything is just going so beautifully. I, too, recall when Vice President Bush was running in the primary against President Reagan and he called the program voodoo economics, and it was and it is. We are facing absolutely massive deficits; this administration has chosen to ignore it; the president has failed to put forth a plan to deal with those deficits and if everything believes that everything is corning up roses, perhaps the vice-president should join me as I travel around the country and speak to people. People in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, are not terribly thrilled with whats happening in the economy because theyre standing in the light of a closed plant because theyve lost their jobs. The people in Youngstown, Ohio, have stores that are boarded up because the economy is not doing well. Its not only the old industries that are failing, its also the new ones. In San Jose, California, theyre complaining because they cant export their high-tech qualities  goods  to Japan and other countries. The people in the Northwest  in the state of Washington and Oregon  are complaining about whats happening to the timber industry and to the agriculture industry. So, so things are not as great as the administration is wanting us to believe in their television commercials. My feeling, quite frankly, is that I have enough experience to see the problems, address them and make the tough decisions and level with people with reference to those problems.",1984-10-11,Democrat
Mashek,"Despite the historic aspects of your candidacy, how do you account for the fact that a majority of women  at least according to the polls  favor the Reagan-Bush ticket over the Mondale-Ferraro ticket?",1984-10-11,Moderator
Ferraro,"I dont. Let me say that Im not a believer in polls and let me say further that what we are talking about are problems that are facing the entire nation. Theyre not just problems facing women. The issues in this campaign are the war-peace issues; the problems of deficits; the problems of trade deficits. We are now facing a $120 billion trade deficit in this country. Were facing problems of the environment. I think what were going to be doing over the next several weeks  and Im absolutely delighted that the League is sponsoring these debates and that we are, we are able to now speak to the American public and address the issues in a way such as this. I think youre going to see a change in those polls.",1984-10-11,Democrat
Vanocur,"Vice President Bush, you have one minute to rebuttal.",1984-10-11,Moderator
Bush,"Well, I was glad to get that vote of confidence from Mrs. Ferraro in my economic judgment. So let me make a statement on the economy. The other clay she was in a plant and she said to the workers, Why are you all voting for, why are so many of you voting for the Reagan-Bush ticket. And there was a long, deathly silence and she said come on, we delivered. Thats the problem. And Im not blaming her except for the liberal voting record in the House. They delivered. They delivered 21  percent interest rates. They delivered what they called malaise. They delivered interest rates that were right off the charts. They delivered take-home pay, checks that were shrinking, and weve delivered optimism. People are going back to work; 6 million of them. And 300,000 jobs a month being created. Thats why there was that deathly silence out there in that plant. They delivered the wrong thing. Ronald Reagan is delivering leadership.",1984-10-11,Republican
Vanocur,"Congresswoman Ferraro, one-minute rebuttal.",1984-10-11,Moderator
Ferraro,"I, I think what Im going to have to do is Im going to start correcting the vice-presidents statistics. There are 6 million more people who have jobs and thats supposed to happen in a growing economy. In fact in the prior administration, with all their problems, they created 10 million jobs. The housing interest rates during this administration, for housing for middle-class Americans, was 14.5 percent. Under the prior administration, with all their problems, the average rate was 10.6 percent. If you take a look at the number of people living in poverty as a result of this administration, 6 million people, 500,000 people knocked off disability rolls. You know, its, you can walk around saying things are great and thats what were going to be hearing, weve been hearing that on those commercials for the past couple of months. I expect they expect the American people to believe that. Ill become a one-woman truth squad and well start tonight.",1984-10-11,Democrat
Vanocur,Mr. White.,1984-10-11,Moderator
White,"Congresswoman Ferraro, I would like to ask you about civil rights. You have in the past been a supporter of tuition tax credits for private parochial schools. And also of a constitutional amendment to ban busing. Both these measures are opposed not only by your running mate but by about every educational and civil rights organization in the country. Now that youre Mr. Mondales running mate have you changed your position on either of those?",1984-10-11,Moderator
Ferraro,"With reference to the busing vote that I cast in 1979, both Fritz Mondale and I agree on the same goal and that is nondiscrimination. I just dont agree on the same direction he does on how to achieve it. But I dont find any problem with that. I think thats been something thats been handled by the courts, and not being handled by Congress and will not be handled by the White House. But we both support nondiscrimination in housing and integration of neighborhoods. The goals we both set forth. With reference to tuition tax credits, I have represented a district in Queens which is 70 percent Catholic. I represented my district. Let me say as well that I have also been a great supporter of public school education and that is something that Fritz and I feel very, very strongly about for the future of this country. And this administration over the past several years has gutted the educational programs available to our young people. It has attempted to knock out Pell Grants, which are monies to young individuals who are poor and who cannot afford to go to college. It has reduced by 25 percent the amount of monies going into college education and by a third those going into secondary and primary schools. But Fritz Mondale and I feel very strongly that if you educate your children that thats an effort and the way that you build up and make a stronger America. With reference to civil rights I think youve got to go beyond that and if you take a look, also, at my record in the Congress and Fritz Mondales record, both in the Senate and as vice president, we both have extremely strong civil rights records. This administration does not. It has come in in the Bob Jones on the side of segregated academies. It came in in the Grove City case on the side of discrimination against women, the handicapped, and the elderly. As a matter of fact, in the Congress we just passed overwhelmingly the Civil Rights Bill of 1984 and this administration, the Republican-controlled Senate, just killed it in the last week or two in Congress. So there is a real difference between how the Mondale-Ferraro administration will address the problems of civil rights and the failure of this administration specifically in that particular area.",1984-10-11,Democrat
White,"In the area of affirmative action, what steps do you think government can take to increase the representation of minorities and women in the work force, and in colleges and universities, and specifically, would you support the use of quotas to achieve those goals?",1984-10-11,Moderator
Ferraro,"I do not support the use of quotas. Both Mr. Mondale and I feel very strongly about affirmative action to correct inequities, and we believe that steps should be taken both through government  for instance, the Small Business Administration. We have supported set-asides for minority and womens businesses. Thats a positive thing. We dont feel that youre in any way hurting anybody else by reaching out with affirmative action to help those whove been disenfranchised. On the contrary, if you have a growing economy, if you create the jobs, if you allow for small business the opportunity with lower interest rates to reach out and grow, there will be more than enough space for everybody. And affirmative action is a very positive way to deal with the problems of discrimination.",1984-10-11,Democrat
White,"Vice-President Bush, many critics of your administration say that it is the most hostile to minorities in recent memory. Have you inadvertently perhaps encouraged that view by supporting tuition tax credits, the antibusing amendment, and siding with Bob Jones University in a case before the Supreme Court, your original opposition to the Voting Rights Act extension and so forth?",1984-10-11,Moderator
Bush,"No, Mr. White, I think our record on civil rights is a good record. You mentioned the Voting Rights extension; it was extended for the longest period of time by President Reagan. But we have some problems in attracting the black vote, and I think our record deserves better. We have done more for black colleges than any previous administration. We favor enterprise zones to give  and its been blocked by Tip ONeill and that House of Representatives, those liberals in that House blocked a new idea to bring jobs into the black communities across the country. And because its not an old handout, special federal spending program, its blocked there  a good idea. And Id like to sec that tried. Weve brought more civil rights cases in the Justice Department than the previous administration by far. We believe in trying something new to help these black teenage kids; the minimum wage differential that says, Look, to an employer, hire these guys. And, yes, theyre willing to work for slightly less than the minimum wage. Give em a training job in the private sector. We threw out that old CETA that didnt train people for jobs that existed, simply rammed them onto the government payroll, and we put in a thing called the Job Training Partnership Act. Wonderful new legislation thats helping blacks more and more. We think of civil rights as something like crime in your neighborhoods. And, for example, when crime figures are going in the right direction thats good, thats a civil right. Similarly, we think of it in terms of quality of life, and that means interest rates. You know, its funny, Mr. Mondale talks about real interest rates. The real interest rate is what you pay when you go down and try to buy a TV set or buy a car, or do whatever it is. The interest rates when we left office were 21% percent. Inflation! Is it a civil right to have the going right off the chart so youre busting every American family, those who can afford it the least? No, weve got a good record. Weve got it on civil rights legislation, minority set-asides, more help for black colleges, and weve got it in terms of an economy thats offering people opportunity and hope instead of despair.",1984-10-11,Republican
White,"Along those lines, sir, many recent studies have indicated that the poor and minorities have not really shared in the new prosperity generated by the current economic recovery. Was it right for your administration to pursue policies, economic policies, that required those at the bottom of the economic ladder to wait for prosperity to trickle clown from people who are much better off than they?",1984-10-11,Moderator
Bush,"Mr. White, its not trickling down. And Im not suggesting theres no poverty, but I am suggesting the way to work out of poverty is through real opportunity. And in the meantime, the needy are getting more help. Human resource spending is way, way up. Aid for Dependent Children spending is up. Immunization programs are up. Almost every place you can point, contrary to Mr. Mondales  I gotta be careful  but contrary of how he goes around just saying everything bad. If somebody sees a silver lining, he finds a big black cloud out there. Whine on harvest moon! I mean, theres a lot going on, a lotta opportunity.",1984-10-11,Republican

Vanocur,Miss Quarles.,1984-10-11,Moderator
Quarles,"Vice-President Bush, one of the most emotional issues in this campaign has been the separation of church and state. What are your views on the separation of church and state specifically with regard to abortion, and do you believe it was right for the archbishop of Philadelphia to have a letter read in 305 churches urging Catholics to fight abortion with their votes?",1984-10-11,Moderator
Bush,"I do believe in pluralism. I do believe in separation of church and state. I dont consider abortion a religious issue. I consider it a moral issue. I believe the archbishop has every right to do everything he wants in that direction, just as I never faulted Jesse Jackson from taking his message to the black pulpits all across this country, just as I never objected when the nuclear arms, the nuclear freeze or the antinuclear people  many of those movements were led by priests. Suddenly, because a Catholic bishop or an evangelist feels strongly on a political issue, people are saying its merging of church and state. We favor  and I speak confidently for the president  we favor separation of church and state. We favor pluralism. Now somebody says you ought to restore prayer in schools. You dont think its right to prohibit a kid from praying in schools. For years kids were allowed to pray in schools. We dont think thats a merger of church and stare to have nonmandatory voluntary, nongovernment-ordered prayer. And yet some are accusing us of injecting religion into politics. I have no problem with what the archbishop does, and I have no problem with what the evangelists on the right do and I have no problem what the priests on the left do. And it didnt bother me when during the Vietnam War much of the opposition to the government  Democrat and Republican governments  was led by priests, encouraging people to break the law and the adage of the  you know  the civil disobedience thing. So our position, separation of church and stare, pluralism, so no little kid with a minority religion of some sort is going to feel offended or feel left out or feel uncomfortable. But, yes, prayer in school on a voluntary basis worked for many, many years until the Supreme Court ruled differently And Im glad we got this question because I think theres been too much said about religion and politics. We dont believe in denominationally moving in. It wasnt our side that raised the question about our president whether he was a good Christian or not and so I, so thats our position  separation of church and state, pluralism, respect for all.",1984-10-11,Republican
Quarles,"Vice-President Bush, four years ago you would have allowed federal financing of abortions in cases of rape and incest ass well as when the mothers life was threatened. Does your position now agree with Reagan who in Sundays debate came very close to saying abortion is murder?",1984-10-11,Moderator
Bush,"You know, there has been  I have to make a confession  an evolution in my position. Theres been 15 million abortions since 1973, and I dont take that lightly. Theres been a million and a half this year. The president and I do favor a human rights amendment. I favor one that would have an exception for incest and rape, and he doesnt, but we both  only for the life of the mother. And I agree with him on that. So yes, my positions evolved, but Id like to see the American who faced with 15 million abortions isnt rethinking his or her position and Ill just stand with the answer. I support the presidents position  and comfortably  from a moral standpoint.",1984-10-11,Republican

Quarles,"Fine. Congresswoman Ferraro, what are your views on the separation of church and state with regard to abortions, and do you believe it was right for the archbishop of Philadelphia to have those letters read in the pulpits and urged the voters to fight abortion with their vote?",1984-10-11,Moderator
Ferraro,"Let me say first of all I believe very, very sincerely in the separation of church and state. Im taking it from the historical viewpoint, if you go back to the 1600s when people came here, the reason they came to this country was to escape religious persecution, and thats the same reason why people are coming here today in the 1940s to escape Nazism, now in the 1980s and 1984 when they can get our of the country to escape communism so they can come here and practice their religion. Our country is founded on the principle that our government should be neutral as far as religion is concerned. Now whats happened over the past several years, and quite frankly Im not going to let you lay on me the intrusion of state politics into religion or religion into politics by my comments with reference to the presidents policies, because it started in 1980 when this administration was running for office and the Reverend Jerry Falwell became very, very involved in the campaign. What has happened over the past four years has been I think a real fudging of that line with the separation of church and state. The actions of the archbishops let me say to you I feel that they have not only a right but a responsibility to speak up, and even though Ive been the person that theyre speaking up about, l feel they do have the responsibility to do so, and I have no problem with it, no more than I did a priest who marched at the time of Vietnam and no more than I did at the time when Martin Luther King marched at the time of the civil rights marches. I have absolutely no problem with them speaking up, I think they have an obligation as well as a right. But what I do have a problem with is when the president of the United States gets up in Dallas and addresses a group of individuals and said to them that anybody who doesnt support his constitutional amendment for prayer in the schools is intolerant of religion. Now there are numerous groups who dont support that prayer in the school, numerous religious groups. Are they intolerant of religion? Is that what the president is saying? I also object, when I am told, that the Reverend Falwell has been told that he would pick two of our Supreme Court justices. Thats going a little bit far. In that instance, let me say to you it is more than a fudging at the line, it is a total intrusion, and I think that its in violation of our Constitution.",1984-10-11,Democrat
Quarles,"Congresswoman Ferraro, as a devout Catholic, does it trouble you that so many of the leaders of your church disagree with you, and do you think that youre being treated unfairly in any way by the Catholic church?",1984-10-11,Moderator
Ferraro,"Let me tell you that I did not come to my position on abortion very lightly. I am a devout Catholic. When I was running for Congress 1978 I sat and met with a person I felt very close to, a monsignor currently a bishop. I spoke to him about my personal feelings that I would never have an abortion, but I was not quite sure if I were ever to become pregnant as result of a rape if I would be that self-righteous. I then spoke to him; he said, Gerry, thats not good enough. There you cant support that position. I said okay. Thats my religious view; I will accept the teaching of the church, but I cannot impose my religious views on someone else. I truly take an oath as a public official to represent all the people in my district, not only the Catholics. If there comes a time where I cannot practice my religion and do my job properly, I will resign my job.",1984-10-11,Democrat
Vanocur,"Vice-President Bush, your rebuttal.",1984-10-11,Moderator
Bush,"Well I respect that statement, I really and truly do. We have difference on a moral question here on abortion. I notice that Mr. Mondale keeps talking in the debate and now its come here about Mr. Falwell. And I dont know where this canard could have come from about Mr. Falwell picking the Supreme Court justices. Ronald Reagan has made one super outstanding, the only one hes made, appointment to the Supreme Court and that was Sandra Day OConnor, and Mr. Falwell opposed her nomination. We still have respect for him, but he opposed it, and so I hope this lays to rest this slander against the president. We want justices who will interpret the Constitution, not legislate it.",1984-10-11,Republican
Vanocur,"Congresswoman Ferraro, your rebuttal?",1984-10-11,Moderator
Ferraro,"Yes, I still find it very difficult to believe because in the platform, which this Republican party passed in Dallas  one of the things they was they said that this position on abortion would be a litmus test, not only for Supreme Court justices but for other federal justices.

Vanocur,The next questioning from Mr. Boyd.,1984-10-11,Moderator
Boyd,"Like many Americans, each of you has recently had an unhappy experience with the Internal Revenue Service. Im going to prolong your ordeal. Congresswoman Ferraro, you disagree with the rule that says that a candidate must report the income or assets of his or her spouse if you get any benefit from them. Your husbands tax return showed that yon did benefit because he paid the mortgage and the property taxes on your home. Now the ethics committee is examining this question, but it wont report its findings until after the election. Would you be willing to ask that committee, which is controlled by Democrats, to hurry up its work and report before the election.",1984-10-11,Moderator
Ferraro,"Let me say to you that I already did that. I wanted them to move ahead. If you recall, I spent about an hour and 45 minutes speaking to 200 reporters on August 21, which is the day after I was required to file my financial statement, and I sat for as long as they had questions on the issue, and I believe that they were satisfied. I filed more information than any other candidate for a national office in the history of this country. Not only did I agree to file my tax returns, after a little bit of prodding my husband also agreed to file his with the  not only the ethics committee but the FEC. Bur the action that youre speaking about with the ethics committee was started by a right-wing legal organization  foundation  knowing that I would have to  that there would be an automatic inquiry. We have filed the necessary papers, I have asked them to move along. Unfortunately, the House, I believe, went out of session today, so I dont know if they will move. But quite frankly, I would like that to be taken care of anyway, because I just want it cleared up.",1984-10-11,Democrat
Boyd,"Since that famous August 21 press conference on your family finances, you filed a new report with the ethics committee, and this showed that your previous reports were full of mistakes and omissions. For example, you failed to report about twelve trips that were paid for by special interest groups. In at least eighteen cases your holdings were misstated. Do you think it showed good leadership or attention to duty to blame all this on sloppy work by your accountant?",1984-10-11,Moderator
Ferraro,"Well, what it showed was that  and it was truly that I hired an accountant who had been with our family for well over forty years. He was filling our those ethics forms. I did not spend the time with him  I just gave him my tax information and he did it. I have to tell you what we have done since I have hired a marvelous accountant. Ive spent a lot of money having him go through all those ethics forms and he will be doing my taxes over the next eight years while were in the White House so that the American public can be sure its all been taken care of.",1984-10-11,Democrat
Boyd,"Vice-President Bush, last year you paid less than 13 percent of your income in federal taxes. According to the IRS, someone in your bracket normally pays about 28 percent of his income. Now what you did was perfectly legal, but do you think it was fair, and is there something wrong with our tax laws that allows such large deductions for wealthy taxpayers?",1984-10-11,Moderator
Bush,"What that figure  and I kind of like the way Mrs. Ferraro and Mr. Zaccaro reported  because they reported federal taxes, state and local taxes  gives people a clearer picture. That year I happened to pay a lot of state and local taxes, which as you know are deducted from the other, and so I looked it up the other day, and we had paid  I think its 42 percent  of our gross income in taxes. Now Mr. Mondale the other night took what I  Ill be honest  I think it was a cheap shot  at me, and we did a little looking around to see about his. We cant find his 198I tax return  it may have been released. Maybe my opponent knows whether Mr. Mondale released it. But we did find estimates that his income for those three years is a million, four hundred thousand dollars, and I think he paid about the same percentage as I did in total taxes. He also made a reference that troubled me very much, Mr. Boyd. He started talking about my chauffeur, and you know, Im driven to work by the Secret Service  so is Mrs. Ferraro  so is Mr. Mondale  they protected his life for four years and now theyve done a beautiful job for Barbara and mine. They saved the life of the president of the United States. I think that was a cheap shot  telling the American people to try to divide class  rich and poor. But the big question isnt whether Mrs. Ferraro is doing well. I think theyre doing pretty well, and I know Barbara and I are doing well. And its darn sure that Mr. Mondale is doing well, with a million four in income, but the question really is  after we get through this disclosure  is the tax cut fair? Are people getting a fair break, and the answer is the rich are paying 6 percent more on taxes and the poor are getting a better break. Those lower and middle-income people that have borne the burden for a long time. So yes, I favor disclosure. Ive always disclosed. This year I had my taxes and everything I own in a blind trust  so blind  blinder than the presidents, so I didnt even sign my tax return. But there seemed to be an interest in it so we went to the government ethics committee  they agreed to change the trust. The trust has been revealed, and I was sure glad to see that I had paid 42 percent of my gross income in taxes.",1984-10-11,Republican
Boyd,"Mr. Vice-President, how can you claim that your home is in Maine for tax purposes and at the same time claim that your home is in Texas for voting purposes? Are you really a Texan or a New Englander.",1984-10-11,Moderator
Bush,"Im really a Texan. But I got one house. And under the law, every taxpayer is allowed, when he sells a house, and buys another house, to get the rollover. Everybody, if it turns out, and I may hire, I notice she said she has a new good accountant. Id like to get his name and phone number because I think Ive paid too much in the way of taxes. And residence, Mr. Boyd, legal residence, for voting, is very different. And the domicile, they call that, very different, than the house. That they say youre living in the vice-presidents house. Therefore you dont get what every  Ive got problems  what every other taxpayer gets. I got problems with the IRS, but so do a lot of people out there. I think Ive paid too much. Nothing ethical. Id like to get some money back.",1984-10-11,Republican
Vanocur,"Congresswoman Ferraro, your rebuttal please.",1984-10-11,Moderator
Ferraro,"Let me just say that Id be happy to give the vice-president the name of my accountant, but I warn you, hes expensive. I think the question is whether or not the tax cuts and the tax system thats currently in our government, that our government uses, is fair; I think the tax system is unfair. But its not something that we can address in the short term. The tax cuts that Vice-President Bush and I got last, three years ago, that this president gave out, no, thats not fair. If you earn $200,000 a year, you got a $25,000 tax cut. If you earned between $20,000 and $40,000, you may have gotten about $1,000 between ten and twenty, close to a hundred dollars and if you made less than $10,000 with all the budget cuts that came down the line, you suffered a loss of $400. Thats not fair. Thats basically unfair and not only is it unfair, but economically it has darn near destroyed this country. Theres a $750 billion tax cut over a five-year period of time. Thats one of the reasons were facing these enormous deficits that we have today.",1984-10-11,Democrat
Vanocur,Mr. Vice-President.,1984-10-11,Moderator
Bush,"No, I think Ive said all I want to say. I do, I didnt fully address myself to Mr. Boyds question no disclosure, I led the fight, I think, in 1968, in the House  I was in the House of Representatives for a couple of terms  and I led the fight for disclosure. I believe in it. Before I went into this job, I disclosed everything we had. We didnt have any private corporations, but I disclosed absolutely everything. Arthur Andersen made out an assets and liabilities statement that I believe went further than any other one. And then, to protect the public interest, we went into this blind trust. I believe in the blind trust because I believe a public official in this kind of job ought not to know whether hes gonna benefit, directly or indirectly, by some holding he might have or something of that nature. And, no, I support full disclosure.",1984-10-11,Republican
Vanocur,Thank you. That ends the part of this debate devoted to domestic affairs. We will now turn to foreign affairs and will begin the questioning with Mr. Mashek.,1984-10-11,Moderator
Mashek,"Vice-President Bush, since your administration came to power the President has threatened a stern response against terrorism, yet murderous attacks have continued in Lebanon and the Middle East. Whos to blame, and youve been director of the Central Intelligence Agency. What can be clone to stop it?",1984-10-11,Moderator
Bush,"Terrorism is very, very difficult to slop. And I think everybody knows that. We had ambassadors killed in Sudan and the Lebanon some time ago, a long time ago. When you see the Israeli building in Lebanon after the death of our marines you see that, hit by terrorism, the Israelis, with all their experience fighting terrorism, you know its difficult. When you see Khomeini wraith his radical Islam resorting to government-sponsored terrorism, its very difficult. The intelligence business can do a good job, and Im always one that defends the Central Intelligence Agency. I believe we ought to strengthen it and I believe we still have the best foreign intelligence business in the world. But it is very difficult to get the source information that you need to go after something as shadowy as international terror. There was a difference between Iran and what happened in Lebanon. In Iran you had a government holding a U.S. embassy; the government sanctioning the takeover of that embassy by those students; the government negotiating with the United States government for their release. In Lebanon, in the terror that happened at the embassy, you have the government there, Mr. Gemayel, that wants to help fight against terrorism. But because of the melee in the Middle East, its there today and has been there yesterday and the day before, and everyone thats had experience in that area knows, it is a very different thing. So what weve got to do is use absolutely the best security possible. I dont think you can go assigning blame. The president, of course, is the best Ive ever seen at accepting that. Hes been wonderful about it in absolutely everything that happens. But I think fair-minded people that really understand international terror know that its very hard to guard against. And the answer then really lies in the Middle East and terrorism happening all over the world, is a solution to the Palestine question, the follow on to Camp David under the umbrella of the Reagan September of 1982 initiative. That will reduce terror, it wont eliminate it.",1984-10-11,Republican
Mashek,You mention Khomeini. Some Republicans charge the previous administration with being almost helpless against Khomeini and Libyas Quaddafi. Why hasnt your administration done something to take action against Arab states that foment this kind of terrorism?,1984-10-11,Moderator
Bush,"What weve done is to support Arab stores that want to stand up against international terror, quite different. We believe in supporting, without jeopardizing the security of Israel in any way, because they are our one strategic ally in the area, they are the one democracy in the area and our relations with them has never been better. But we do believe in reaching out to the, what they call the GCC, those Gulf Cooperative Council State, those moderate Arab states in that world, and helping them with defensive weapons to guard against international terror or radical Islam perpetuated by Khomeini. And because weve done that and because the Saudis chopped down a couple of those intruding airplanes a while back, I think we have helped keep the peace in the Persian Gulf.",1984-10-11,Republican
Mashek,"Congresswoman Ferraro, you and former Vice-President Mondale have criticized the president over the bombings in Lebanon, but what would you do to prevent such attacks?",1984-10-11,Moderator
Ferraro,"Let me first say that terrorism is a global problem, and let me say secondly that the  Mr. Bush has referred to the embassy that was held in Iran, Well, I was at the White House in January, I guess it was, in 81, when those hostages, all fifty-two of them, came home alive. It was at that time that President Reagan gave a speech welcoming them home  as America did, we were so excited to see them back. But what he said was: The United States has been embarrassed for the last time. Were going to stand tall and if this ever happens again, theres going to be swift and immediate steps taken to address the wrong that our country has founded  has suffered. In April of J983 I was in Beirut and visited the ambassador at the embassy. Two weeks later, that embassy was bombed. At that time  take a look at the crazy activities of terrorists, you cant blame that on anybody. Theyre going to do crazy things and you just dont know whats going to happen. The following October, there was another bombing and that bombing took place at the marine barracks, where there were 242 young men who were killed. Right after that bombing occurred, there was a commission set up called the Long Commission. That commission did a study of the security arrangements around where the marines were sleeping and found that there was negligence, that they did not have proper gates up, proper precautions to stop those trucks from coming in. And so the Long Commission issued a report, and President Reagan got up and he said: Im commander in chief. I take responsibility. And we all waited for something to be done when he look responsibility. Well, last month we had our third bombing, The first time, the first embassy, there was no gate up, The second time, with our Marines, the gate was open. The third time, the gate was there but it had not been installed. And what was the presidents reaction? Well, the security arrangements were not in, our people were placed in that embassy in an unsecured time, and the marines who were guarding it were left to go away and there were other people guarding the embassy. Again the president said: I assume responsibility. Id like to know what that means. Are we going to take proper precautions before we put Americans in situations where theyre in danger, or are we just going to walk away, throwing our arms in the air now  quite a reversal from the first time, from the first time when he said he was going to do something? Or is this President going to take some action?",1984-10-11,Democrat
Mashek,Some Democrats cringe at the words spying and covert activity. Do you believe both of them have a legitimate role in countering terrorist activity around the world?,1984-10-11,Moderator
Ferraro,"I think they have a legitimate role in gathering information. And what has happened was the CIA, in the last bombing, had given information to our administration with reference to the actual threats that that embassy was going to be bombed. So it wasnt the CIA that was at fault. Theres legitimate reason for the CIA to be in existence, and thats to gather intelligence information for our security. But when I see the CIA doing things like theyre doing down in Central America  supporting a covert war  no, I dont support that kind of activity. The CIA is there, its meant to protect our government; not there to subvert other governments.",1984-10-11,Democrat

This is serious business. And sometimes its quiet support for a friend, and so Ill leave that one there. But let me help you with the difference, Mrs. Ferraro, between Iran and the embassy in Lebanon. Iran  we were held by a foreign government. In Lebanon you had a wanton, terrorist action where the government opposed it. We went to Lebanon to give peace a chance, to stop the bombing of civilians in Beirut, to remove 13,000 terrorists from Lebanon  and we did. We saw the formation of a government of reconciliation and for somebody to suggest, as our two opponents have, that these men died in shame  they better not tell the parents of those young marines. They gave peace a chance. And our allies were with us  the British, the French, and the Italians.",1984-10-11,Republican

Ive been a member of Congress for six years; I was there when the embassy was held hostage in Iran, and I have been there and Ive seen what has happened in the past several months; seventeen months of your administration. Secondly, please dont categorize my answers, either. Leave the interpretation of my answers to the American people who are watching this debate. And let me say further that no one has ever said that those young men who were killed through the negligence of this administration and others ever died in shame. No one who has a child who is nineteen or twenty years old, a son, would ever say that at the loss of anybody elses child.",1984-10-11,Democrat

White,"Congresswoman Ferraro, youve repeatedly said that you would not want your son to die in an undeclared war for an uncertain cause. But recently your running mate, Mr. Mondale, has suggested that it may become necessary to erect a military quarantine or blockade of Nicaragua. Under what circumstances would you advocate the use of military force, American combat forces, in Central America?",1984-10-11,Moderator
Ferraro,"I would advocate the use of force when it was necessary to protect the security of our country, protect our security interest or protect our people or protect the interests of our friends and neighbors. When president  Im jumping the gun a bit, arent I?  when Mr. Mondale, Mr. Mondale referred to the quarantine of Central America, a country in Central America, what he is referring to is a last resort after all other means of attempting to settle the situation down in that region of the world had been exhausted. Quite frankly now what is being done by this administration is an Americanizing of a regional conflict. Theyre moving in militarily instead of promoting the Contadora process, which, as you know, is the process that is in place with the support of Mexico and Colombia and Panama and Venezuela. Instead of supporting the process, our administration has in Nicaragua been supporting covert activities to keep that revolution going in order to overthrow the Sandinista government; in El Salvador was not pushing the head of the government to move toward correction of the civil rights; human rights problems that existed there, and now this administration seems almost befuddled by the fact that Nicaragua is moving to participate in the Contadora process, and El Salvador is, through its President Duarte, is reaching out to the guerrillas in order to negotiate a peace. What Fritz Mondale and I feel about the situation down there is that what you do is you deal first through negotiation. That force is not a first resort but certainly a last resort in any instance.",1984-10-11,Democrat

White,Many times in its history the United States has gone to war in order to defend freedom in other lands. Does your answer mean that you would be willing to forgo the use of military force even if it meant the establishment of a Soviet-back dictatorship so close to our own borders?,1984-10-11,Moderator
Ferraro,"No, I think what you have to do is work with the government  I assume youre speaking about the government of Nicaragua  work with that government to achieve a pluralistic society. I mean they do have elections that are coming up on November 4. I think we have to work with them to achieve a peaceful solution to bring about a pluralistic country. No, Im not willing to live with a force that could be a danger to our country. Certainly, I would see that our country would be there putting all kinds of pressure on the neighboring countries of Honduras, of Costa Rica, of El Salvador, to promote the kind of society that we can all live with and security in this country.",1984-10-11,Democrat
White,"Vice-President Bush, both Cuba and Nicaragua are reported to be making extensive preparations to defend themselves against an American invasion, which they claim could come this fall. And even some of your Democratic opponents in Congress have suggested that the administration may be planning a December surprise invasion. Can you tell us under what circumstances a reelected Reagan administration would consider the use of force in Central American or the Caribbean? Bush: We dont think were to be required to use force. Let me point out that there are 2,000 Cuban military and 7,500 so-called Cuban advisers in Nicaragua. There are 55 American military in El Salvador. I went down, on the instructions of the president, to speak to the commandants in El Salvador and told them that they had to move with Mr. Magana, then the president of El Salvador, to respect human rights. They have done that. Theyre moving well. Im not saying its perfect, but the difference between El Salvador and Nicaragua is like the difference between night and day. El Salvador went to the polls, Mr. Duarte was elected by 70 percent of the people in 70 percent voting in a certifiably free election. In Nicaragua, you have something very different. You have a Marxist-Leninist group, the Sandinistas, that came into power talking democracy. They have aborted their democracy. They have humiliated the Holy Father. They have cracked down on the only press organ there, La Prensa, censoring the press something that should concern every American. They have not had any human rights at all. They will not permit free elections. Mr. Cruz, who was to be the only viable challenger to Nicaragua, the Sandinistas, to the junta, to Mr. Ortega, went down there and found that the ground rules were so unfair that he couldnt even wage a campaign. One country is devoid of human rights. The other is struggling to perfect their democracy. We dont like it, frankly, when Nicaragua exports its revolution or serves as a conduit for supplies coming over from such democracies as North Korea, Bulgaria, the Soviet Union and Cube, to try to destabilize El Salvador. Yes, were concerned about that. Because we want to see this trend toward democracy continue. There have been something like thirteen countries since weve come in move toward the democratic route, and let me say that Grenada is not unrelated. And I have a big difference with Mrs. Ferraro on that one. We gave those four tiny Caribbean countries a chance. We saved the lives, and most of those thousand students said they were in jeopardy. Grenada was a proud moment because we did stand up for democracy. But in terms of threat of these countries, nuclear, I mean, weapons, no. Theres not that kind of a threat. Its Mr. Mondale that proposed the quarantine, not Ronald Reagan.",1984-10-11,Moderator

Bush,"I support what were doing. It was supported to the Congress and under the law. I support it. My only regret is that the aid for the contras, those people that are fighting, we call them freedom fighters. They want to see the democracy perfected in Nicaragua. Am I to understand from this assault on covert action that nowhere in the world would we do something that was considered just off base when Mrs. Ferraro said shes never support it? Would she never support it if the violation of human rights was so great and quiet support was necessary for freedom fighters? Yes, were for the contras. And let me tell you another fact about the controls. Everyone thats not for this, everyone who wants to let that Sandinista government prevail, just like that Castro did, all of that, the contras are not Somozistas. Less than 5 percent of the contras supported Somoza. These were people that wanted a revolution. These people that felt the revolution was betrayed. These are people that support human rights. Yes, we should support them.",1984-10-11,Republican

Ferraro,"I spent time in Central America in January and had an opportunity to speak to the contras after the incident in Nicaragua and in El Salvador. Let me just say that the situation as it exists now, because of this administrations policies, are not getting better. Were not moving toward a more secure area of the world. As a matter of fact the number of troops that the Sandinistas have accumulated since the administration started its covert activities has risen from 12,000 to 50,000, and of course the number of Soviet and Cuban advisors has also increased. I did not support the mining of the harbors in Nicaragua; it is a violation of international law. Congress did not support it and as a matter of fact, just this week, the Congress voted in cut off covert aid to Nicaragua unless and until a request is made and there is evidence of need for it, and the Congress approves it again in March. So if Congress doesnt get laid on, the covert activities which I opposed in Nicaragua, those CIA covert activities in that specific country, are not supported by the Congress. And believe it or not, not supported by the majority of people throughout the country.",1984-10-11,Democrat

Ortega, the commandante who is head of the Nicaraguan Sandinistas, is an avowed Marxist. They dont believe in the church. They dont believe in free elections. They dont believe in all of the values that we believe in. So it is our policy to support the democracy there, and when you have freedom fighters that want to protect that revolution, and go the democratic route, we believe in giving them support. We are for democracy in the hemisphere. We are for negotiations. $3 out of every $4 that we sent down there has been for economic aid to support the peoples chance to eat and live and be happy and enjoy life.

The Soviets havent changed that much. Can you tell us why President Reagan has not met with the Soviet ministers at all and only met with Prime Minister Gromyko less than a month ago?",1984-10-11,Moderator
Bush,"Yes, I can. The, you mentioned the Gromyko meeting, those were broken off under the Carter-Mondale days. There had been three separate Soviet leaders. Mr. Brezhnev, Mr. Andropov, and now Chernenko. During their, that, in three and a half years, three separate leaders. The Soviets have not been willing to talk. We are the ones that went to the table in INF. We had a good proposal, a moral proposal. Ban an entire generation of intermediate nuclear force weapons and if you wont do that, dont leave your allies in Europe in a monopoly position. The Soviets with 1,200 of these things, and the alliance with none. We didnt think thats the way to deter aggression and keep the peace. The president went, the first thing he did when he came into office was make a proposal on the most destabilizing weapons of all, START. And when the the strategic weapon and when the Soviets said, well, we dont like that proposal, we said all right, well be more flexible. I at the urging of the president went to Geneva and laid on the table a treaty to ban all chemical weapons. We dont want them to have a monopoly. We said look, lets come together. You come over here and see what were doing; well go over there and see what youre doing. But lets save the kids of this world from chemical weapons. A brilliant proposal to get rid of all of them. And the Soviets nyet, nyet nyet. In the mutual balance force reduction to reduce conventional forces, theyre not even willing to tell us the base. Mrs. Ferraro knows that, and how many troops they have. Theres four sessions. We have had an agreement with them on the hot line. But Carter-Monad made an agreement, the Salt II agreement, but the Democratic Senate, they were a Democratic administration, the Democratic Senate wouldnt even ratify that agreement. It was flawed, it was unverifiable and it was not good. Our president wants to reduce, not just to stop, he wants to reduce dramatically nuclear weapons. And when the Soviets know theyre going to have this strong president to deal with, and when this new administration, Mr. Chernenko, given more than a few months in office can solidify its position, then theyll talk. But if they think the opposition, before they sit down, are going to give up the MX, give up the B-l, go for a freeze that locks in inferiority in Europe, all of these things, unilaterally, before theyre willing to talk, they may just sweat it out for four more weeks. Who knows.",1984-10-11,Republican
Quarles,"You were once quoted as saying that a nuclear war is winnable. Is that still your belief, and if not, under what circumstances would you use nuclear weapons if you were president?",1984-10-11,Moderator
Bush,"No, I dont think its winnable. I was quoted wrong, obviously, cause I never thought that. The Soviet planning, I did learn that when I was director of Central Intelligence, and I dont think thered be any disagreement, is based on that ugly concept. But I agree with the president: It should never be fought. Nuclear weapons should never be fought with, and thats our approach. So, therefore, lets encourage the Soviets to come to the table as we did at the Gromyko meeting. I wish everybody could have seen that one  the President, giving the facts to Gromyko in all of these nuclear meetings  excellent, right on top of that subject matter. And Ill bet you that Gromyko went back to the Soviet Union saying, Hey, listen, this president is calling the shots; wed better move. But do you know why I think well get an agreement? Because I think it is in the interest of the Soviet Union to make it, just as it is in the United States. Theyre not deterred by rhetoric. I listened to the rhetoric for two years at the United Nations. Ive lived in a Communist country. Its not rhetoric that decides agreements, its self-interest of those countries.",1984-10-11,Republican
Quarles,"Congresswoman Ferraro, you and Mr. Mondale are for a verifiable nuclear freeze. Some Democrats have said that verification may not be possible. How would you verify such an agreement and make sure that the Soviets are not cheating?",1984-10-11,Moderator
Ferraro,"Let me say first of all that I dont think there is any issue that is more important in this campaign, in this election, than the issue of war and peace. And since today is Eleanor Roosevelts 100th birthday, let me quote her. She said, It is not enough to want peace, you must believe in it. And it is not enough to believe in it, you must work for it. This administrations policies have indicated quite the opposite. The last time I heard Vice President Bush blame the fact that they didnt meet with the Soviet leader, and this is the first president in forty years not to meet with a Soviet counterpart. He said the reason was because there are three Soviet leaders in the past three and a half years. I went and got a computer printout. Its five pages of the leaders, world leaders, that the Soviet leaders have met with, and theyre not little people. Theyre people like Mitterrand of France and Kohl of Germany and President Kiprianou of Cyprus  you go down the list, five pages of people that the Soviet leaders have managed to meet with and somehow they couldnt meet with the president of the United States. In addition to not meeting with his Soviet counterpart, this is the first president  and youre right  since the start of negotiating arms control agreements who have not negotiated an arms control agreement, But not only has he not negotiated one, hes been opposed to every single one that every other president has negotiated, including Eisenhower, including Ford, and including Nixon. Now, let me just say that with reference to the vice-presidents comments about the intent and the desire of the United Sites and this administration, the Soviet Union did walk out of the talks. I agree. But it seems to me in 1982, when the administration presented its Start proposal, that it wasnt a realistic proposal. And that is the comment that was made by Secretary Haig after he left office, because what it dealt with was that it dealt just with land-based nuclear missiles, which is where the Soviets had the bulk of their missiles. But that aside, in 1982, I believe it was, their own negotiator, Nitze, came out with a proposal called the walk-in-the-woods proposal which would have limited the number of nuclear arms in Europe. That proposal was turned down by the administration  a proposal presented by its own administrator. Now Im delighted that they met with Mr. Gromyko, but they could have had that opportunity to meet with him in 1981 when he came to the UN, which he had done with every other president before, and in 1982 as well. I guess my",1984-10-11,Democrat

And the Soviet Union  the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union will meet with a lot of different people. Weve been in very close touch with Mr. Mitterrand, Mr. Kohl, and others that have met with the leaders of the Soviet Union. But thats quite different than meeting with the president of the United States. The Soviets say well have a meeting when we think there can be progress and yet they left those talks. Id like to correct my opponent on the walk in the woods. It was the Soviet Union that was unwilling to discuss the walk in the woods. They were the ones that gunned it down first and the record is very, very clear on that. Miss Ferraro mentioned the inflexibility of our position on strategic arms. Yes, we offered first to get rid of all those  we tried to reduce the SS-18s and those weapons. But then we said if thats not good enough, there is flexibility, lets talk about the bombers and planes. So thats a very important point in terms of negotiation.",1984-10-11,Republican

Weve had four years of relative peace under President Reagan. How can you convince the American public that the world would be a safer place under Carter-Mondale? [sic]",1984-10-11,Moderator
Ferraro,"I think first of all, you have to take a look at the current situation. We now have 50,000 nuclear warheads; we are building at the rate of five or six a day between us and we have been doing that since this administration came into office. I think what you can do is look at what theyve done and recognize that theyre not going to do very much in the future. And so, since theyve done nothing, do we continue to build because an arms race doesnt lead to anything, it leads to another arms race and thats that. Vice President Monad has indicated that what he would do, first of all, as soon as he. gets into office, is contact his Soviet counterpart and set up an annual summit meeting. Thats number one. I dont think you can start negotiating until you start talking. Secondly, he would issue a challenge, and the challenge would be in the nature of temporary, mutual, verifiable, moratoria to halt testing in the air, in the atmosphere, that would respond with a challenge from the Soviet Union, we hope, to sit down and negotiate a treaty.

That was done in 1960 by President Kennedy  in 1963. What he did was he issued a challenge to the Soviet Union. He said we will not test in space  in the atmosphere, if you will not. They did not. In two months they sat down and they negotiated a treaty. We do not now have to worry about that type of testing. It can be done; it will be done, if only you have the will to do it. Again, remember it is mutual; it is verifiable and it is a challenge that once that challenge is not met, if testing were to resume, then we would continue testing as well.",1984-10-11,Democrat

Boyd,"Congresswoman Ferraro, you have had little or no experience with military matters and yet you might someday find yourself commander-in-chief of the armed forces. How can you convince the American people and the potential enemy that you would know what to do to protect this nations security, and do you think in any way that the Soviets might be tempted to try to take advantage of you simply because you are a woman?",1984-10-11,Moderator
Ferraro,Are you saying that I would have to have fought in the war in order to love peace?,1984-10-11,Democrat
Boyd,"Im not saying that, Im asking you  you know what I asked.",1984-10-11,Moderator
Ferraro,"All right. I think what happens is when you try to equate whether or not I have had military experience, thats the natural conclusion. Its about as valid as saying that you would have to be black in order to despise racism, that youd have to be female in order to be terribly offended by sexism. And thats just not so. I think if you take a look at where Ive been, both in the Congress and where I intend to go, the type of person I am  I think that the people of this country can rely upon the fact that I will be a lender. I dont think the Soviet Union for one minute can sit down and make determination on what I will do if Im ever in a position to have to do something with reference to the Soviet Union. Quite frankly Im prepared to do whatever is necessary in order to secure this country and make sure that security is maintained. Secondly, if the Soviet Union were to ever believe that they could challenge the United States with any sort of nuclear forces or otherwise, if I were in a position of leadership in this country, they would be assured that they would be met with swift, concise and certain retaliation. Let me just say one other thing now. The most important thing, though I think as a leader that what one has to do is get to the point where youre not put into that position. And the way you to that position of rnoving away from having to make a decision  armed force or anything else  is by moving toward arms control. And thats not whats been done over the past four years. I think that if you were to take a look at the failures of this administration that would have to be number one. I will not put myself in that position as a leader in this country. I will move immediately toward arms control negotiations.",1984-10-11,Democrat

Ferraro,"Oh, I dont have a single-most question. I guess the concern that I have is a concern not only as a vice-presidential candidate but as a citizen in this country. My concern is that we are not doing anything to stop the arms race, and if seems to me that if we keep talking about military inferiority  which we do not have, we are at a comparable level with the Soviet Union; our Joint Chiefs of Staff have said theyd never exchange our military power for theirs. I guess the thing that Id want is a commitment that pretty soon theyre going to do something about making this a safer world for all of us.",1984-10-11,Democrat
Boyd,"Vice-President Bush, four years ago President Reagan insisted that a military buildup would bring the Soviets to negotiate seriously. Since then, we have spent almost a trillion dollars on defense but the Soviets are still building their military forces as rapidly as we are, and there are no negotiations. Was the presidents original premise, his whole strategy, wrong?",1984-10-11,Moderator
Bush,"No, I think his strategy not only was correct but is correct. Youve got to go back where we were. Clearly, when we came into office, the American people recognized that we had slipped into positions of inferiority on various things. Some of our planes, as the president points out, were older than the pilots; ships that couldnt go out to sea. And you had a major problem with the military. Actually, the morale wasnt very good either. So we have had to strengthen the military and were well on the way to getting that job done. America is back in terms of military strength, in terms of our ability to deter aggression and keep the peace. At the same time, however, we have made proposals and proposals and proposals  sound proposals  on reducing nuclear weapons. The Strategic Arms Reduction Talks were good proposals, and its the Soviets who left the table. The Intermediate Nuclear Force Talks were sound talks, and I wish the Soviet Union had continued them. The chemical weapon treaty to ban all chemical weapons, it was our initiative, not the Soviets. And we wish they would think anew and move forward to verification so everybody would know whether the other side was keeping its word. But, much more important, youd reduce the level of terror. Similarly, were reducing  trying to talk to them, and are talking to them, in Vienna, about conventional force reduction. Weve talked to them about human rights. Ive met with Mr. Andropov and Mr. Chernenko, and we mention and we try to do something about the human rights question. The suppression of Soviet Jews is absolutely intolerable and so we have to keep pushing forward on the moral grounds as well as on the arms reduction ground. But it is my view that because this president has been strong, and because weve addressed the imbalances  and I think were very close to getting that job done  the Soviets are more likely to make a deal. The Soviets made an ABM treaty when they felt we were going to deploy an ABM system. So I am optimistic for the future, once they realize that they will have this strong, principled president to negotiate with, strong leadership, and yet with demonstrable flexibility on arms control.",1984-10-11,Republican

Let me put it this way  I dont have any questions, but we are so different from  the Reagan-Bush administration is so different from the Carter-Mondale [sic] administration that the American people are going to have the clearest choice. Its a question of going back to the failed ideas of the past, where we came in  21% percent on those interest rates, inflation, despair, malaise, no leadership, blaming the American people for failed leadership. Or another option  keep this recovery going until it benefits absolutely everybody. Peace at home  peace abroad  prosperity  opportunity.

I must say that Im also tickled by their comments on human rights. The Soviet Union in 1979 allowed 51,000 people to emigrate, because, in large measure, this administrations policies over the past four years, 1,313 people got out of the Soviet Union in 1983 and 1984.

Bush,"Well, in a couple of weeks, you, the American people, will be faced, three weeks, with a choice. Its the clearest choice in some fifty years. And the choice is, do we move forward with strength and with prosperity or do we go back to weakness, despair, disrespect. Ronald Reagan and I have put our trust in the American people. Weve moved some of the power away from Washington, D.C., and put it back with the people. Were pulling together. The neighborhoods are safer cause crime is going down. Your sons and daughters are doing better in school. Test scores are going up. Theres a new opportunity lying out there in the future. Science, technology and space offering opportunity that, to everybody, all the young ones coming up. And abroad theres new leadership and respect. And Ronald Reagan is clearly the strong leader of the free world. And Ill be honest with you. Its a joy to serve with a president who does not apologize for the United States of America. Mr. Mondale, on the other hand, has one idea. Go out and tax the American people. And then he wants to repeal indexing, to wipe out the one protection that those at the lowest end of the economic scale have protecting them against being rammed into higher and higher tax brackets. We just owe our country too much to go back to that kind of an approach. Id like to say something to the young people. I started a business. I know what it is to have a dream and have a job and work hard to employ others and really to participate in the American dream. Some of you out there are finishing high school or college and some of you are starting out in the working place. And we want for you Americas greatest gift. And that is opportunity. And then, peace. Yes, I did serve in combat. I was shot down when I was a young kid, scared to death. And all that did, saw friends die, but that heightened my convictions about peace. It is absolutely essential that we guarantee the young people that they will not know the agony of war. Americas gift, opportunity and peace. Now we do have some unfinished business. We must continue to go ahead. The world is too complex to go back to vacillation and weakness. Weve too much going on to go back to the failed policies of the past.

Ferraro,"I hope somebody wants to applaud. Being the candidate for vice-president of my party is the greatest honor I have ever had. But its not only a personal achievement for Geraldine Ferraro  and certainly not only the bond that I feel as I go across this country with women throughout the country. I wouldnt be standing here if Fritz Mondale didnt have the courage and my party didnt stand for the values that it does  the values of fairness and equal opportunity. Those values make our country strong and the future of this country and how strong it will be is what this election is all about. Over the last two months Ive been traveling all over the country talking to the people about the future. I was in Kentucky and I spoke to the Dyhouse family. He works for a car dealer and hes worried about the deficits and how high interest rates are going to affect his job. Every place I go I see young parents with their children and they say to me what are we going to do to stop this nuclear arms race. I was in Dayton, Ohio, a week and a half ago and I sat with the Allen family who live next door to a toxic dump and theyre very, very concerned about the fact that those toxics are seeping into the water that they and their neighbors drink. Now those people love this country and theyre patriotic. But its not the patriotism that youre seeing in the commercials as you watch television these days. Their patriotism is not only a pride in the country as it is, but a pride in this country that is strong enough to meet the challenges of the future. Do you know when we find jobs for the eight and a half million people who are unemployed in this country, you know well make our economy stronger and that will be a patriotic act. When we reduce the deficits and we cut interest rates, and I know the president doesnt believe that, but its so  we cut those interest rates young people can buy houses, thats pro-family and that will be a patriotic act. When we educate our children  good Lord, theyre going to be able to compete in a world economy and that makes us stronger and thats a patriotic act. When we stop the arms race, we make this a safer, saner world, and thats a patriotic act, and when we keep the peace young men dont die, and thats a patriotic act. Those are the keys to the future and who can be the leader for the future? When Walter Mondale was attorney general of Minnesota, he led the fight for a man who could not afford to get justice because he couldnt afford a lawyer; when he was in the Senate he fought for child nutrition programs, he wrote the Fair Housing Act, he even investigated the concerns and the abuses of migrant workers. And why did he do that? Those werent popular causes. You know, no one had ever heard of Clarence Gideon, the man without a lawyer. Children dont vote and migrant workers exactly a powerful lobby in this country, but he did it because it was right. Fritz Mondale has said that he would rather lose a battle for decency than win one over self-interest. Now I agree with him. This campaign is not over.

Theyre just barely enough to pay for my food and pay for an apartment. I cant begin to pay back my student loans. So what we have to do is two things. We have to make sure that we make it easier for kids to afford college.",2012-10-16,Republican
Romney,"And also make sure that when they get out of college, theres a job. When I was governor of Massachusetts, to get a high school degree, you had to pass an exam. If you graduated in the top quarter of your airlines, we gave you a John and Abigail Adams scholarship, four years tuition free in the college of your choice in Massachusetts, its a public institution. I want to make sure we keep our Pell grant program growing. Were also going to have our loan program, so that people are able to afford school. But the key thing is to make sure you can get a job when you get out of school. And whats happened over the last four years has been very, very hard for Americas young people. I want you to be able to get a job. I know what it takes to get this economy going. With half of college kids graduating this year without a college  excuse me, without a job. And without a college level job, thats just unacceptable. And likewise youve got more and more debt on your back. So more debt and less jobs. Im going to change that. I know what it takes to create good jobs again. I know what it takes to make sure that you have the kind of opportunity you deserve. And kids across this country are going to recognize, were bringing back an economy.",2012-10-16,Republican
Romney,"2014. When you come out in 2014, I presume Im going to be president. Im going to make sure you get a job. Thanks Jeremy. Yeah, you bet.",2012-10-16,Republican
Crowley,Mr. President?,2012-10-16,Moderator
Obama,"Jeremy, first of all, your future is bright. And the fact that youre making an investment in higher education is critical. Not just to you, but to the entire nation. Now, the most important thing we can do is to make sure that we are creating jobs in this country. But not just jobs, good paying jobs. Ones that can support a family.",2012-10-16,Democrat
Obama,"And what I want to do, is build on the five million jobs that weve created over the last 30 months in the private sector alone. And there are a bunch of things we can do to make sure your future is bright. Number one, I want to build manufacturing jobs in this country again. Now when Governor Romney said we should let Detroit go bankrupt. I said were going to bet on American workers and the American auto industry and its come surging back. I want to do that in industries, not just in Detroit, but all across the country and that means we change our tax code so were giving incentives to companies that are investing here in the United States and creating jobs here. It also means were helping them and small businesses to export all around the world to new markets. Number two, weve got to make sure that we have the best education system in the world. And the fact that youre going to college is great, but I want everybody to get a great education and weve worked hard to make sure that student loans are available for folks like you, but I also want to make sure that community colleges are offering slots for workers to get retrained for the jobs that are out there right now and the jobs of the future. Number three, weve got to control our own energy. Now, not only oil and natural gas, which weve been investing in; but also, weve got to make sure were building the energy source of the future, not just thinking about next year, but ten years from now, 20 years from now. Thats why weve invested in solar and wind and biofuels, energy efficient cars. Weve got to reduce our deficit, but weve got to do it in a balanced way. Asking the wealthy to pay a little bit more along with cuts so that we can invest in education like yours. And lets take the money that weve been spending on war over the last decade to rebuild America, roads, bridges schools. We do those things, not only is your future going to be bright but Americas future is going to bright as well.",2012-10-16,Democrat
Crowley,Let me ask you for more immediate answer and begin with Mr. Romney just quickly what  what can you do? Were looking at a situation where 40 percent of the unemployed have been unemployed have been unemployed for six months or more. They dont have the two years that Jeremy has.,2012-10-16,Moderator
Romney,"Well what youre seeing in this country is 23 million people struggling to find a job. And a lot of them, as you say, Candy, have been out of work for a long, long, long time. The presidents policies have been exercised over the last four years and they havent put Americans back to work. We have fewer people working today than we had when the president took office. If the  the unemployment rate was 7.8 percent when he took office, its 7.8 percent now. But if you calculated that unemployment rate, taking back the people who dropped out of the workforce, it would be 10.7 percent. We have not made the progress we need to make to put people back to work. Thats why I put out a five-point plan that gets America 12 million new jobs in four years and rising take-home pay. Its going to help Jeremy get a job when he comes out of school. Its going to help people across the country that are unemployed right now. And one thing that the president said, which I want to make sure that we understand, he said that I said we should take Detroit bankrupt. And thats right. My plan was to have the company go through bankruptcy like 7-Eleven did and Macys and Condell (ph) Airlines and come out stronger. And I know he keeps saying, you want to take Detroit bankrupt. Well, the president took Detroit bankrupt. You took General Motors bankrupt. You took Chrysler bankrupt. So when you say that I wanted to take the auto industry bankrupt, you actually did. And I think its important to know that that was a process that was necessary to get those companies back on their feet, so they could start hiring more people. That was precisely what I recommended and ultimately what happened.",2012-10-16,Republican
Crowley,"Let me give the president a chance. Go ahead. OBAMA: Candy, what Governor Romney said just isnt true. He wanted to take them into bankruptcy without providing them any way to stay open. And we would have lost a million jobs. And that  dont take my word for it, take the executives at GM and Chrysler, some of whom are Republicans, may even support Governor Romney. But theyll tell you his prescription wasnt going to work. And Governor Romneys says hes got a five-point plan? Governor Romney doesnt have a five-point plan. He has a one-point plan. And that plan is to make sure that folks at the top play by a different set of rules. Thats been his philosophy in the private sector, thats been his philosophy as governor, thats been his philosophy as a presidential candidate. You can make a lot of money and pay lower tax rates than somebody who makes a lot less. You can ship jobs overseas and get tax breaks for it. You can invest in a company, bankrupt it, lay off the workers, strip away their pensions, and you still make money. Thats exactly the philosophy that weve seen in place for the last decade. Thats whats been squeezing middle class families. And we have fought back for four years to get out of that mess. The last thing we need to do is to go back to the very same policies that got us there.",2012-10-16,Moderator

Crowley,"OK. Will  will  you certainly will have lots of time here coming up. Because I want to move you on to something thats sort of connected to cars here, and  and go over. And we want to get a question from Phillip Tricolla.",2012-10-16,Moderator
Obama,"The most important thing we can do is to make sure we control our own energy. So heres what Ive done since Ive been president. We have increased oil production to the highest levels in 16 years. Natural gas production is the highest its been in decades. We have seen increases in coal production and coal employment. But what Ive also said is we cant just produce traditional source of energy. Weve also got to look to the future. Thats why we doubled fuel efficiency standards on cars. That means that in the middle of the next decade, any car you buy, youre going to end up going twice as far on a gallon of gas. Thats why we doubled clean  clean energy production like wind and solar and biofuels. And all these things have contributed to us lowering our oil imports to the lowest levels in 16 years. Now, I want to build on that. And that means, yes, we still continue to open up new areas for drilling. We continue to make it a priority for us to go after natural gas. Weve got potentially 600,000 jobs and 100 years worth of energy right beneath our feet with natural gas. And we can do it in an environmentally sound way. But weve also got to continue to figure out how we have efficiency energy, because ultimately thats how were going to reduce demand and thats whats going to keep gas prices lower. Now, Governor Romney will say hes got an all-of-the-above plan, but basically his plan is to let the oil companies write the energy policies. So hes got the oil and gas part, but he doesnt have the clean energy part. And if we are only thinking about tomorrow or the next day and not thinking about 10 years from now, were not going to control our own economic future. Because China, Germany, theyre making these investments. And Im not going to cede those jobs of the future to those countries. I expect those new energy sources to be built right here in the United States. Thats going to help Jeremy get a job. Its also going to make sure that youre not paying as much for gas.",2012-10-16,Democrat
Crowley,"Governor, on the subject of gas prices?",2012-10-16,Moderator
Romney,"Well, lets look at the presidents policies, all right, as opposed to the rhetoric, because weve had four years of policies being played out. And the presidents right in terms of the additional oil production, but none of it came on federal land. As a matter of fact, oil production is down 14 percent this year on federal land, and gas production was down 9 percent. Why? Because the president cut in half the number of licenses and permits for drilling on federal lands, and in federal waters. So whered the increase come from? Well a lot of it came from the Bakken Range in North Dakota. What was his participation there? The administration brought a criminal action against the people drilling up there for oil, this massive new resource we have. And what was the cost? 20 or 25 birds were killed and brought out a migratory bird act to go after them on a criminal basis. Look, I want to make sure we use our oil, our coal, our gas, our nuclear, our renewables. I believe very much in our renewable capabilities; ethanol, wind, solar will be an important part of our energy mix. But what we dont need is to have the president keeping us from taking advantage of oil, coal and gas. This has not been Mr. Oil, or Mr. Gas, or Mr. Coal. Talk to the people that are working in those industries. I was in coal country. People grabbed my arms and said, Please save my job. The head of the EPA said, You cant build a coal plant. Youll virtually  its virtually impossible given our regulations. When the president ran for office, he said if you build a coal plant, you can go ahead, but youll go bankrupt. Thats not the right course for America. Lets take advantage of the energy resources we have, as well as the energy sources for the future. And if we do that, if we do what Im planning on doing, which is getting us energy independent, North America energy independence within eight years, youre going to see manufacturing jobs come back. Because our energy is low cost, that are already beginning to come back because of our abundant energy. Ill get America and North America energy independent. Ill do it by more drilling, more permits and licenses. Were going to bring that pipeline in from Canada. How in the world the president said no to that pipeline? I will never know. This is about bringing good jobs back for the middle class of America, and thats what Im going to do. CROWLEY: Mr. President, let me just see if I can move you to the gist of this question, which is, are we looking at the new normal? I can tell you that tomorrow morning, a lot of people in Hempstead will wake up and fill up and they will find that the price of gas is over $4 a gallon.",2012-10-16,Republican
Obama,"Candy, theres no doubt that world demands gone up, but our production is going up, and were using oil more efficiently. And very little of what Governor Romney just said is true. Weve opened up public lands. Were actually drilling more on public lands than in the previous administration and my  the previous president was an oil man. And natural gas isnt just appearing magically. Were encouraging it and working with the industry. And when I hear Governor Romney say hes a big coal guy, I mean, keep in mind, when  Governor, when you were governor of Massachusetts, you stood in front of a coal plant and pointed at it and said, This plant kills, and took great pride in shutting it down. And now suddenly youre a big champion of coal. So what Ive tried to do is be consistent. With respect to something like coal, we made the largest investment in clean coal technology, to make sure that even as were producing more coal, were producing it cleaner and smarter. Same thing with oil, same thing with natural gas. And the proof is our oil imports are down to the lowest levels in 20 years. Oil production is up, natural gas production is up, and, most importantly, were also starting to build cars that are more efficient. And thats creating jobs. That means those cars can be exported, cause thats the demand around the world, and it also means that itll save money in your pocketbook.",2012-10-16,Democrat

So what we said was you cant just sit on this for 10, 20, 30 years, decide when you want to drill, when you want to produce, when its most profitable for you. These are public lands. So if you want to drill on public lands, you use it or you lose it.",2012-10-16,Democrat

And coal, coal production is not up; coal jobs are not up. I was just at a coal facility, where some 1,200 people lost their jobs. The right course for America is to have a true all-of-the-above policy. I dont think anyone really believes that youre a person whos going to be pushing for oil and gas and coal. Youll get your chance in a moment. Im still speaking.",2012-10-16,Republican

Obama, (inaudible).,2012-10-16,Democrat
Romney,That wasnt the question.,2012-10-16,Republican
Obama,OK.,2012-10-16,Democrat
Romney,"That was a statement. I dont think the American people believe that. I will fight for oil, coal and natural gas. And the proof, the proof of whether a strategy is working or not is what the price is that youre paying at the pump. If youre paying less than you paid a year or two ago, why, then, the strategy is working. But youre paying more. When the president took office, the price of gasoline here in Nassau County was about $1.86 a gallon. Now, its $4.00 a gallon. The price of electricity is up. If the presidents energy policies are working, youre going to see the cost of energy come down. I will fight to create more energy in this country, to get America energy secure. And part of that is bringing in a pipeline of oil from Canada, taking advantage of the oil and coal we have here, drilling offshore in Alaska, drilling offshore in Virginia where the people want it. Those things will get us the energy we need.",2012-10-16,Republican
Crowley,"Mr. President, could you address, because we did finally get to gas prices here, could you address what the governor said, which is if your energy policy was working, the price of gasoline would not be $4 a gallon here. Is that true?",2012-10-16,Moderator
Obama,"Well, think about what the governor  think about what the governor just said. He said when I took office, the price of gasoline was $1.80, $1.86. Why is that? Because the economy was on the verge of collapse, because we were about to go through the worst recession since the Great Depression, as a consequence of some of the same policies that Governor Romneys now promoting. So, its conceivable that Governor Romney could bring down gas prices because with his policies, we might be back in that same mess. What I want to do is to create an economy that is strong, and at the same time produce energy. And with respect to this pipeline that Governor Romney keeps on talking about, weve  weve built enough pipeline to wrap around the entire earth once. So, Im all for pipelines. Im all for oil production. What Im not for is us ignoring the other half of the equation. So, for example, on wind energy, when Governor Romney says these are imaginary jobs. When youve got thousands of people right now in Iowa, right now in Colorado, who are working, creating wind power with good-paying manufacturing jobs, and the Republican senator in that  in Iowa is all for it, providing tax breaks (ph) to help this work and Governor Romney says Im opposed. Id get rid of it. Thats not an energy strategy for the future. And we need to win that future. And I intend to win it as President of the United States.",2012-10-16,Democrat

Romney,"Hi, Mary.",2012-10-16,Republican
Obama,Youre doing great.,2012-10-16,Democrat
Romney,"Thank you very much. And let me tell you, youre absolutely right about part of that, which is I want to bring the rates down, I want to simplify the tax code, and I want to get middle- income taxpayers to have lower taxes. And the reason I want middle-income taxpayers to have lower taxes is because middle-income taxpayers have been buried over the past four years. Youve seen, as middle-income people in this country, incomes go down $4,300 a family, even as gasoline prices have gone up $2,000. Health insurance premiums, up $2,500. Food prices up. Utility prices up. The middle-income families in America have been crushed over the last four years. So I want to get some relief to middle-income families. Thats part  thats part one. Now, how about deductions? Cause Im going to bring rates down across the board for everybody, but Im going to limit deductions and exemptions and credits, particularly for people at the high end, because I am not going to have people at the high end pay less than theyre paying now. The top 5 percent of taxpayers will continue to pay 60 percent of the income tax the nation collects. So thatll stay the same. Middle-income people are going to get a tax break. And so, in terms of bringing down deductions, one way of doing that would be say everybody gets  Ill pick a number  $25,000 of deductions and credits, and you can decide which ones to use. Your home mortgage interest deduction, charity, child tax credit, and so forth, you can use those as part of filling that bucket, if you will, of deductions. But your rate comes down and the burden also comes down on you for one more reason, and that is every middle-income taxpayer no longer will pay any tax on interest, dividends or capital gains. No tax on your savings. That makes life a lot easier. If youre getting interest from a bank, if youre getting a statement from a mutual fund or any other kind of investment you have, you dont have to worry about filing taxes on that, because therell be no taxes for anybody making $200,000.00 per year and less, on your interest, dividends and capital gains. Why am I lowering taxes on the middle-class? Because under the last four years, theyve been buried. And I want to help people in the middle-class. And I will not  I will not under any circumstances, reduce the share thats being paid by the highest income taxpayers. And I will not, under any circumstances increase taxes on the middle-class. The presidents spending, the presidents borrowing will cost this nation to have to raise taxes on the American people. Not just at the high end. A recent study has shown the people in the middle-class will see $4,000.00 per year in higher taxes as a result of the spending and borrowing of this administration. I will not let that happen. I want to get us on track to a balanced budget, and Im going to reduce the tax burden on middle income families. And whats that going to do? Its going to help those families, and its going to create incentives to start growing jobs again in this country.",2012-10-16,Republican
Crowley,"Thanks, Governor.",2012-10-16,Moderator
Obama,"My philosophy on taxes has been simple. And that is, I want to give middle-class families and folks who are striving to get into the middle-class some relief. Because they have been hit hard over the last decade. Over the last 15, over the last 20 years. So four years ago I stood on a stage just like this one. Actually it was a town hall, and I said I would cut taxes for middle- class families, and thats what Ive done, by $3,600.00. I said I would cut taxes for small businesses, who are the drivers and engines of growth. And weve cut them 18 times. And I want to continue those tax cuts for middle-class families, and for small business. But what Ive also said is, if were serious about reducing the deficit, if this is genuinely a moral obligation to the next generation, then in addition to some tough spending cuts, weve also got to make sure that the wealthy do a little bit more. So what Ive said is, your first $250,000.00 worth of income, no change. And that means 98 percent of American families, 97 percent of small businesses, they will not see a tax increase. Im ready to sign that bill right now. The only reason its not happening is because Governor Romneys allies in Congress have held the 98 percent hostage because they want tax breaks for the top 2 percent. But what Ive also says is for above $250,000, we can go back to the tax rates we had when Bill Clinton was president. We created 23 million new jobs. Thats part of what took us from deficits to surplus. It will be good for our economy and it will be good for job creation. Now, Governor Romney has a different philosophy. He was on 60 Minutes just two weeks ago and he was asked: Is it fair for somebody like you, making $20 million a year, to pay a lower tax rate than a nurse or a bus driver, somebody making $50,000 year? And he said, Yes, I think thats fair. Not only that, he said, I think thats what grows the economy. Well, I fundamentally disagree with that. I think what grows the economy is when you get that tax credit that we put in place for your kids going to college. I think that grows the economy. I think what grows the economy is when we make sure small businesses are getting a tax credit for hiring veterans who fought for our country. That grows our economy. So we just have a different theory. And when Governor Romney stands here, after a year of campaigning, when during a Republican primary he stood on stage and said Im going to give tax cuts  he didnt say tax rate cuts, he said tax cuts to everybody, including the top 1 percent, you should believe him because thats been his history. And thats exactly the kind of top-down economics that is not going to work if we want a strong middle class and an economy thats striving for everybody.",2012-10-16,Democrat
Crowley,"Governor Romney, Im sure youve got a reply there. (LAUGHTER) ROMNEY: Youre absolutely right. You heard what I said about my tax plan. The top 5 percent will continue to pay 60 percent, as they do today. Im not looking to cut taxes for wealthy people. I am looking to cut taxes for middle-income people. And why do I want to bring rates down, and at the same time lower exemptions and deductions, particularly for people at the high end? Because if you bring rates down, it makes it easier for small business to keep more of their capital and hire people. And for me, this is about jobs. I want to get Americas economy going again. Fifty-four percent of Americas workers work in businesses that are taxed as individuals. So when you bring those rates down, those small businesses are able to keep more money and hire more people. For me, I look at whats happened in the last four years and say this has been a disappointment. We can do better than this. We dont have to settle for, how many months, 43 months with unemployment above 8 percent, 23 million Americans struggling to find a good job right now. There are 3.5 million more women living in poverty today than when the president took office. We dont have to live like this. We can get this economy going again. My five-point plan does it. Energy independence for North America in five years. Opening up more trade, particularly in Latin America. Cracking down on China when they cheat. Getting us to a balanced budget. Fixing our training programs for our workers. And finally, championing small business. I want to make small businesses grow and thrive. I know how to make that happen. I spent my life in the private sector. I know why jobs come and why they go. And theyre going now because of the policies of this administration.",2012-10-16,Moderator
Crowley,"Governor, let me ask the president something about what you just said.",2012-10-16,Moderator
Obama,"No, its not settled. Look, the cost of lowering rates for everybody across the board, 20 percent. Along with what he also wants to do in terms of eliminating the estate tax, along what he wants to do in terms of corporates, changes in the tax code, it costs about $5 trillion. Governor Romney then also wants to spend $2 trillion on additional military programs even though the militarys not asking for them. Thats $7 trillion. He also wants to continue the Bush tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans. Thats another trillion dollars  thats $8 trillion. Now, what he says is hes going to make sure that this doesnt add to the deficit and hes going to cut middleclass taxes. But when hes asked, how are you going to do it, which deductions, which loopholes are you going to close? He cant tell you. The  the fact that he only has to pay 14 percent on his taxes when a lot of you are paying much higher. Hes already taken that off the board, capital gains are going to continue to be at a low rate so we  were not going to get money that way. We havent heard from the governor any specifics beyond Big Bird and eliminating funding for Planned Parenthood in terms of how he pays for that. Now, Governor Romney was a very successful investor. If somebody came to you, Governor, with a plan that said, here, I want to spend $7 or $8 trillion, and then were going to pay for it, but we cant tell you until maybe after the election how were going to do it, you wouldnt take such a sketchy deal and neither should you, the American people, because the math doesnt add up. And  and whats at stake here is one of two things, either Candy  this blows up the deficit because keep in mind, this is just to pay for the additional spending that hes talking about, $7 trillion  $8 trillion before we even get to the deficit we already have.

I ran the  the state of Massachusetts as a governor, to the extent any governor does, and balanced the budget all four years.

I know what it takes to balance budgets. Ive done it my entire life. So for instance when he says, Yours is a $5 trillion cut. Well, no its not.

Obama,"Well, Katherine, thats a great question. And, you know, I was raised by a single mom who had to put herself through school while looking after two kids. And she worked hard every day and made a lot of sacrifices to make sure we got everything we needed. My grandmother, she started off as a secretary in a bank. She never got a college education, even though she was smart as a whip. And she worked her way up to become a vice president of a local bank, but she hit the glass ceiling. She trained people who would end up becoming her bosses during the course of her career. She didnt complain. Thats not what you did in that generation. And this is one of the reasons why one of the first  the first bill I signed was something called the Lily Ledbetter bill. And its named after this amazing woman who had been doing the same job as a man for years, found out that she was getting paid less, and the Supreme Court said that she couldnt bring suit because she should have found about it earlier, whereas she had no way of finding out about it. So we fixed that. And thats an example of the kind of advocacy that we need, because women are increasingly the breadwinners in the family. This is not just a womens issue, this is a family issue, this is a middle-class issue, and thats why weve got to fight for it. It also means that weve got to make sure that young people like yourself are able to afford a college education. Earlier, Governor Romney talked about he wants to make Pell Grants and other education accessible for young people. Well, the truth of the matter is, is that thats exactly what weve done. Weve expanded Pell Grants for millions of people, including millions of young women, all across the country. We did it by taking $60 billion that was going to banks and lenders as middlemen for the student loan program, and we said, lets just cut out the middleman. Lets give the money directly to students. And as a consequence, weve seen millions of young people be able to afford college, and thats going to make sure that young women are going to be able to compete in that marketplace. But weve got to enforce the laws, which is what we are doing, and weve also got to make sure that in every walk of life we do not tolerate discrimination. Thats been one of the hallmarks of my administration. Im going to continue to push on this issue for the next four years.",2012-10-16,Democrat

Romney,"Thank you. And important topic, and one which I learned a great deal about, particularly as I was serving as governor of my state, because I had the chance to pull together a cabinet and all the applicants seemed to be men.",2012-10-16,Republican
Romney,"And  and so we  we took a concerted effort to go out and find women who had backgrounds that could be qualified to become members of our cabinet. I went to a number of womens groups and said, Can you help us find folks, and they brought us whole binders full of women. I was proud of the fact that after I staffed my Cabinet and my senior staff, that the University of New York in Albany did a survey of all 50 states, and concluded that mine had more women in senior leadership positions than any other state in America. Now one of the reasons I was able to get so many good women to be part of that team was because of our recruiting effort. But number two, because I recognized that if youre going to have women in the workforce that sometimes you need to be more flexible. My chief of staff, for instance, had two kids that were still in school. She said, I cant be here until 7 or 8 oclock at night. I need to be able to get home at 5 oclock so I can be there for making dinner for my kids and being with them when they get home from school. So we said fine. Lets have a flexible schedule so you can have hours that work for you. Were going to have to have employers in the new economy, in the economy Im going to bring to play, that are going to be so anxious to get good workers theyre going to be anxious to hire women. In the  in the last women have lost 580,000 jobs. Thats the net of whats happened in the last four years. Were still down 580,000 jobs. I mentioned 31/2 million women, more now in poverty than four years ago. What we can do to help young women and women of all ages is to have a strong economy, so strong that employers that are looking to find good employees and bringing them into their workforce and adapting to a flexible work schedule that gives women opportunities that they would otherwise not be able to afford. This is what I have done. Its what I look forward to doing and I know what it takes to make an economy work, and I know what a working economy looks like. And an economy with 7.8 percent unemployment is not a real strong economy. An economy that has 23 million people looking for work is not a strong economy.",2012-10-16,Republican

Obama,"Katherine, I just want to point out that when Governor Romneys campaign was asked about the Lilly Ledbetter bill, whether he supported it? He said, Ill get back to you. And thats not the kind of advocacy that women need in any economy. Now, there are some other issues that have a bearing on how women succeed in the workplace. For example, their healthcare. You know a major difference in this campaign is that Governor Romney feels comfortable having politicians in Washington decide the health care choices that women are making. I think thats a mistake. In my health care bill, I said insurance companies need to provide contraceptive coverage to everybody who is insured. Because this is not just a  a health issue, its an economic issue for women. It makes a difference. This is money out of that familys pocket. Governor Romney not only opposed it, he suggested that in fact employers should be able to make the decision as to whether or not a woman gets contraception through her insurance coverage. Thats not the kind of advocacy that women need. When Governor Romney says that we should eliminate funding for Planned Parenthood, there are millions of women all across the country, who rely on Planned Parenthood for, not just contraceptive care, they rely on it for mammograms, for cervical cancer screenings. Thats a pocketbook issue for women and families all across the country. And it makes a difference in terms of how well and effectively women are able to work. When we talk about child care, and the credits that were providing. That makes a difference in whether they can go out there and  and earn a living for their family. These are not just womens issues. These are family issues. These are economic issues. And one of the things that makes us grow as an economy is when everybody participates and women are getting the same fair deal as men are.",2012-10-16,Democrat

And I dont believe employers should tell someone whether they could have contraceptive care of not. Every woman in America should have access to contraceptives. And  and the  and the presidents statement of my policy is completely and totally wrong.,2012-10-16,Republican
Obama,Governor,2012-10-16,Democrat
Romney,"Let me come back and  and answer your question. President Bush and I are  are different people and these are different times and thats why my five point plan is so different than what he would have done. I mean for instance, we can now, by virtue of new technology actually get all the energy we need in North America without having to go to the  the Arabs or the Venezuelans or anyone else. That wasnt true in his time, thats why my policy starts with a very robust policy to get all that energy in North America  become energy secure. Number two, trade  Ill crack down on China, President Bush didnt. Im also going to dramatically expand trade in Latin America. Its been growing about 12 percent per year over a long period of time. I want to add more free trade agreements so well have more trade. Number three, Im going to get us to a balanced budget. President Bush didnt. President Obama was right, he said that that was outrageous to have deficits as high as half a trillion dollars under the Bush years. He was right, but then he put in place deficits twice that size for every one of his four years. And his forecast for the next four years is more deficits, almost that large. So thats the next area Im different than President Bush. And then lets take the last one, championing small business. Our party has been focused too long. I came through small business. I understand how hard it is to start a small business. Thats why everything Ill do is designed to help small businesses grow and add jobs. I want to keep their taxes down on small business. I want regulators to see their job as encouraging small enterprise, not crushing it. And the thing I find the most troubling about Obama Care, well its a long list, but one of the things I find most troubling is that when you go out and talk to small businesses and ask them what they think about it, they tell you it keeps them from hiring more people. My priority is jobs. I know how to make that happen. And President Bush has a very different path for a very different time. My path is designed in getting small businesses to grow and hire people.",2012-10-16,Republican
Crowley,"Thanks, Governor.",2012-10-16,Moderator
Obama,"Well, first of all, I think its important to tell you that we did come in during some tough times. We were losing 800,000 jobs a month when I started. But we had been digging our way out of policies that were misplaced and focused on the top doing very well and middle class folks not doing well. Now, weve seen 30 consecutive  31 consecutive months of job growth; 5.2 million new jobs created. And the plans that I talked about will create even more. But when Governor Romney says that he has a very different economic plan, the centerpiece of his economic plan are tax cuts. Thats what took us from surplus to deficit. When he talks about getting tough on China, keep in mind that Governor Romney invested in companies that were pioneers of outsourcing to China, and is currently investing in countries  in companies that are building surveillance equipment for China to spy on its own folks. Thats  Governor, youre the last person whos going to get tough on China. And what weve done when it comes to trade is not only sign three trade deals to open up new markets, but weve also set up a task force for trade that goes after anybody who is taking advantage of American workers or businesses and not creating a level playing field. Weve brought twice as many cases against unfair trading practices than the previous administration and weve won every single one thats been decided. When I said that we had to make sure that China was not flooding our domestic market with cheap tires, Governor Romney said I was being protectionist; that it wouldnt be helpful to American workers. Well, in fact we saved 1,000 jobs. And thats the kind of tough trade actions that are required. But the last point I want to make is this. You know, there are some things where Governor Romney is different from George Bush. George Bush didnt propose turning Medicare into a voucher. George Bush embraced comprehensive immigration reform. He didnt call for self-deportation. George Bush never suggested that we eliminate funding for Planned Parenthood, so there are differences between Governor Romney and George Bush, but theyre not on economic policy. In some ways, hes gone to a more extreme place when it comes to social policy. And I think thats a mistake. Thats not how were going to move our economy forward.",2012-10-16,Democrat

I told you Id cut taxes for small businesses, and I have. I said that Id end the war in Iraq, and I did. I said wed refocus attention on those who actually attacked us on 9/11, and we have gone after Al Qaedas leadership like never before and Osama bin Laden is dead.",2012-10-16,Democrat
Obama,"I said that we would put in place health care reform to make sure that insurance companies cant jerk you around and if you dont have health insurance, that youd have a chance to get affordable insurance, and I have. I committed that I would rein in the excesses of Wall Street, and we passed the toughest Wall Street reforms since the 1930s. Weve created five million jobs, and gone from 800 jobs a month being lost, and we are making progress. We saved an auto industry that was on the brink of collapse. Now, does that mean youre not struggling? Absolutely not. A lot of us are. And thats why the plan that Ive put forward for manufacturing and education, and reducing our deficit in a sensible way, using the savings from ending wars, to rebuild America and putting people back to work. Making sure that we are controlling our own energy, but not only the energy of today, but also the energy of the future. All of those things will make a difference, so the point is the commitments Ive made, Ive kept. And those that I havent been able to keep, its not for lack of trying and were going to get it done in a second term. But, you should pay attention to this campaign, because Governor Romney has made some commitments as well. And I suspect hell keep those too. You know when members of the Republican Congress say, Were going to sign a no tax pledge, so that we dont ask a dime for millionaires and billionaires to reduce our deficit so we can still invest in education, and helping kids go to college. He said, Me too. When they said, Were going to cut Planned Parenthood funding. He said, Me too. When he said, Were going to repeal Obamacare. First thing Im going to do, despite the fact that its the same health care plan that he passed in Massachusetts and is working well. He said, Me too.

I think you know that these last four years havent been so good as the president just described and that you dont feel like your confident that the next four years are going to be much better either. I can tell you that if you were to elect President Obama, you know what youre going to get. Youre going to get a repeat of the last four years. We just cant afford four more years like the last four years. He said that by now wed have unemployment at 5.4 percent. The difference between where it is and 5.4 percent is 9 million Americans without work. I wasnt the one that said 5.4 percent. This was the presidents plan. Didnt get there. He said he would have by now put forward a plan to reform Medicare and Social Security, because he pointed out theyre on the road to bankruptcy. He would reform them. Hed get that done. He hasnt even made a proposal on either one. He said in his first year hed put out an immigration plan that would deal with our immigration challenges. Didnt even file it. This is a president who has not been able to do what he said hed do. He said that hed cut in half the deficit. He hasnt done that either. In fact, he doubled it. He said that by now middle-income families would have a reduction in their health insurance premiums by $2,500 a year. Its gone up by $2,500 a year. And if Obamacare is passed, or implemented  its already been passed  if its implemented fully, itll be another $2,500 on top.",2012-10-16,Republican
Romney,"The middle class is getting crushed under the policies of a president who has not understood what it takes to get the economy working again. He keeps saying, Look, Ive created 5 million jobs. Thats after losing 5 million jobs. The entire record is such that the unemployment has not been reduced in this country. The unemployment, the number of people who are still looking for work, is still 23 million Americans. There are more people in poverty, one out of six people in poverty. How about food stamps? When he took office, 32 million people were on food stamps. Today, 47 million people are on food stamps. How about the growth of the economy? Its growing more slowly this year than last year, and more slowly last year than the year before. The president wants to do well. I understand. But the policies hes put in place from Obamacare to Dodd-Frank to his tax policies to his regulatory policies, these policies combined have not let this economy take off and grow like it could have. You might say, Well, you got an example of one that worked better? Yeah, in the Reagan recession where unemployment hit 10.8 percent, between that period  the end of that recession and the equivalent of time to today, Ronald Reagans recovery created twice as many jobs as this presidents recovery. Five million jobs doesnt even keep up with our population growth. And the only reason the unemployment rate seems a little lower today is because of all the people that have dropped out of the workforce. The president has tried, but his policies havent worked. Hes great as a  as a  as a speaker and describing his plans and his vision. Thats wonderful, except we have a record to look at. And that record shows he just hasnt been able to cut the deficit, to put in place reforms for Medicare and Social Security to preserve them, to get us the rising incomes we need. Median income is down $4,300 a family and 23 million Americans out of work. Thats what this election is about.

Romney,"Thank you. Lorraine? Did I get that right? Good. Thank you for your question. And let me step back and tell you what I would like to do with our immigration policy broadly and include an answer to your question. But first of all, this is a nation of immigrants. We welcome people coming to this country as immigrants. My dad was born in Mexico of American parents; Anns dad was born in Wales and is a first-generation American. We welcome legal immigrants into this country. I want our legal system to work better. I want it to be streamlined. I want it to be clearer. I dont think you have to  shouldnt have to hire a lawyer to figure out how to get into this country legally. I also think that we should give visas to people  green cards, rather, to people who graduate with skills that we need. People around the world with accredited degrees in science and math get a green card stapled to their diploma, come to the U.S. of A. We should make sure our legal system works. Number two, were going to have to stop illegal immigration. There are 4 million people who are waiting in line to get here legally. Those whove come here illegally take their place. So I will not grant amnesty to those who have come here illegally. What I will do is Ill put in place an employment verification system and make sure that employers that hire people who have come here illegally are sanctioned for doing so. I wont put in place magnets for people coming here illegally. So for instance, I would not give drivers licenses to those that have come here illegally as the president would. The kids of those that came here illegally, those kids, I think, should have a pathway to become a permanent resident of the United States and military service, for instance, is one way they would have that kind of pathway to become a permanent resident.",2012-10-16,Republican
Romney,"Now when the president ran for office, he said that hed put in place, in his first year, a piece of legislation  hed file a bill in his first year that would reform our  our immigration system, protect legal immigration, stop illegal immigration. He didnt do it. He had a Democrat House, a Democrat Senate, super majority in both Houses. Why did he fail to even promote legislation that would have provided an answer for those that want to come legally and for those that are here illegally today? Whats a question I think the  the president will have a chance to answer right now.",2012-10-16,Republican
Obama,"Good, I look forward to it. Was  Lorranna  Lorraine  we are a nation of immigrants. I mean were just a few miles away from Ellis Island. We all understand what this country has become because talent from all around the world wants to come here. People are willing to take risks. People who want to build on their dreams and make sure their kids have an even bigger dreams than they have. But were also a nation of laws. So what Ive said is we need to fix a broken immigration system and Ive done everything that I can on my own and sought cooperation from Congress to make sure that we fix the system. The first thing we did was to streamline the legal immigration system, to reduce the backlog, make it easier, simpler and cheaper for people who are waiting in line, obeying the law to make sure that they can come here and contribute to our country and thats good for our economic growth. Theyll start new businesses. Theyll make things happen to create jobs here in the United States. Number two, we do have to deal with our border so we put more border patrol on the  any time in history and the flow of undocumented works across the border is actually lower than its been in 40 years. What Ive also said is if were going to go after folks who are here illegally, we should do it smartly and go after folks who are criminals, gang bangers, people who are hurting the community, not after students, not after folks who are here just because theyre trying to figure out how to feed their families. And thats what weve done. And what Ive also said is for young people who come here, brought here often times by their parents. Had gone to school here, pledged allegiance to the flag. Think of this as their country. Understand themselves as Americans in every way except having papers. And we should make sure that we give them a pathway to citizenship. And thats what Ive done administratively. Now, Governor Romney just said, you know he wants to help those young people too, but during the Republican primary, he said, I will veto the DREAM Act, that would allow these young people to have access. His main strategy during the Republican primary was to say, Were going to encourage self-deportation. Making life so miserable on folks that theyll leave. He called the Arizona law a model for the nation. Part of the Arizona law said that law enforcement officers could stop folks because they suspected maybe they looked like they might be undocumented workers and check their papers. You know what? If my daughter or yours looks to somebody like theyre not a citizen, I dont want  I dont want to empower somebody like that. So, we can fix this system in a comprehensive way. And when Governor Romney says, the challenge is, Well Obama didnt try. Thats not true. I have sat down with Democrats and Republicans at the beginning of my term. And I said, lets fix this system. Including Senators previously who had supported it on the Republican side. But its very hard for Republicans in Congress to support comprehensive immigration reform, if their standard bearer has said that, this is not something Im interested in supporting.",2012-10-16,Democrat

Crowley,the idea of self-deportation?,2012-10-16,Moderator
Romney,"No, let  let  let me go back and speak to the points that the president made and  and  and lets get them correct. I did not say that the Arizona law was a model for the nation in that aspect. I said that the E-Verify portion of the Arizona law, which is  which is the portion of the law which says that employers could be able to determine whether someone is here illegally or not illegally, that that was a model for the nation. Thats number one. Number two, I asked the president a question I think Hispanics and immigrants all over the nation have asked. He was asked this on Univision the other day. Why, when you said youd filed legislation in your first year didnt you do it? And he didnt answer. He  he doesnt answer that question. He said the standard bearer wasnt for it. Im glad you thought I was a standard bearer four years ago, but I wasnt. Four years ago you said in your first year you would file legislation. In his first year, I was just getting  licking my wounds from having been beaten by John McCain, all right. I was not the standard bearer. My  my view is that this president should have honored his promise to do as he said. Now, let me mention one other thing, and that is self-deportation says let people make their own choice. What I was saying is, were not going to round up 12 million people, undocumented illegals, and take them out of the nation. Instead let people make their own choice. And if they  if they find that  that they cant get the benefits here that they want and they cant  and they cant find the job they want, then theyll make a decision to go a place where  where they have better opportunities. But Im not in favor of rounding up people and  and  and taking them out of this country. I am in favor, as the president has said, and I agree with him, which is that if people have committed crimes we got to get them out of this country.",2012-10-16,Republican

Obama,"Well, let me first of all talk about our diplomats, because they serve all around the world and do an incredible job in a very dangerous situation. And these arent just representatives of the United States, they are my representatives. I send them there, oftentimes into harms way. I know these folks and I know their families. So nobody is more concerned about their safety and security than I am. So as soon as we found out that the Benghazi consulate was being overrun, I was on the phone with my national security team and I gave them three instructions. Number one, beef up our security and procedures, not just in Libya, but at every embassy and consulate in the region. Number two, investigate exactly what happened, regardless of where the facts lead us, to make sure folks are held accountable and it doesnt happen again. And number three, we are going to find out who did this and were going to hunt them down, because one of the things that Ive said throughout my presidency is when folks mess with Americans, we go after them.",2012-10-16,Democrat
Obama,"Now Governor Romney had a very different response. While we were still dealing with our diplomats being threatened, Governor Romney put out a press release, trying to make political points, and thats not how a commander in chief operates. You dont turn national security into a political issue. Certainly not right when its happening. And people  not everybody agrees with some of the decisions Ive made. But when it comes to our national security, I mean what I say. I said Id end the war in Libya  in  in Iraq, and I did. I said that wed go after al-Qaeda and bin Laden, we have. I said wed transition out of Afghanistan, and start making sure that Afghans are responsible for their own security, thats what Im doing. And when it comes to this issue, when I say that we are going to find out exactly what happened, everybody will be held accountable. And I am ultimately responsible for whats taking place there because these are my folks, and Im the one who has to greet those coffins when they come home. You know that I mean what I say.",2012-10-16,Democrat

And  and I  I think the president just said correctly that the buck does stop at his desk and  and he takes responsibility for  for that  for the failure in providing those security resources, and  and those terrible things may well happen from time to time. I  Im  I feel very deeply sympathetic for the families of those who lost loved ones. And today theres a memorial service for one of those that was lost in this tragedy. We  we think of their families and care for them deeply. There were other issues associated with this  with this tragedy. There were many days that passed before we knew whether this was a spontaneous demonstration, or actually whether it was a terrorist attack.",2012-10-16,Republican
Romney,"And there was no demonstration involved. It was a terrorist attack and it took a long time for that to be told to the American people. Whether there was some misleading, or instead whether we just didnt know what happened, you have to ask yourself why didnt we know five days later when the ambassador to the United Nations went on TV to say that this was a demonstration. How could we have not known? But I find more troubling than this, that on  on the day following the assassination of the United States ambassador, the first time thats happened since 1979, when  when we have four Americans killed there, when apparently we didnt know what happened, that the president, the day after that happened, flies to Las Vegas for a political fund-raiser, then the next day to Colorado for another event, other political event. I think these  these actions taken by a president and a leader have symbolic significance and perhaps even material significance in that youd hope that during that time we could call in the people who were actually eyewitnesses. Weve read their accounts now about what happened. It was very clear this was not a demonstration. This was an attack by terrorists. And this calls into question the presidents whole policy in the Middle East. Look whats happening in Syria, in Egypt, now in Libya. Consider the distance between ourselves and  and Israel, the president said that  that he was going to put daylight between us and Israel. We have Iran four years closer to a nuclear bomb. Syria  Syrias not just a tragedy of 30,000 civilians being killed by a military, but also a strategic  strategically significant player for America. The presidents policies throughout the Middle East began with an apology tour and  and  and pursue a strategy of leading from behind, and this strategy is unraveling before our very eyes.",2012-10-16,Republican

That this was an act of terror and I also said that were going to hunt down those who committed this crime. And then a few days later, I was there greeting the caskets coming into Andrews Air Force Base and grieving with the families. And the suggestion that anybody in my team, whether the Secretary of State, our U.N.

Obama,"Were a nation that believes in the Second Amendment, and I believe in the Second Amendment. Weve got a long tradition of hunting and sportsmen and people who want to make sure they can protect themselves. But there have been too many instances during the course of my presidency, where Ive had to comfort families who have lost somebody. Most recently out in Aurora. You know, just a couple of weeks ago, actually, probably about a month, I saw a mother, who I had met at the bedside of her son, who had been shot in that theater. And her son had been shot through the head. And we spent some time, and we said a prayer and, remarkably, about two months later, this young man and his mom showed up, and he looked unbelievable, good as new. But there were a lot of families who didnt have that good fortune and whose sons or daughters or husbands didnt survive. So my belief is that, (A), we have to enforce the laws weve already got, make sure that were keeping guns out of the hands of criminals, those who are mentally ill. Weve done a much better job in terms of background checks, but weve got more to do when it comes to enforcement. But I also share your belief that weapons that were designed for soldiers in war theaters dont belong on our streets. And so what Im trying to do is to get a broader conversation about how do we reduce the violence generally. Part of it is seeing if we can get an assault weapons ban reintroduced. But part of it is also looking at other sources of the violence. Because frankly, in my home town of Chicago, theres an awful lot of violence and theyre not using AK-47s. Theyre using cheap hand guns. And so what can we do to intervene, to make sure that young people have opportunity; that our schools are working; that if theres violence on the streets, that working with faith groups and law enforcement, we can catch it before it gets out of control. And so what I want is a  is a comprehensive strategy. Part of it is seeing if we can get automatic weapons that kill folks in amazing numbers out of the hands of criminals and the mentally ill. But part of it is also going deeper and seeing if we can get into these communities and making sure we catch violent impulses before they occur.",2012-10-16,Democrat
Crowley,"Governor Romney, the question is about assault weapons, AK-47s.",2012-10-16,Moderator
Romney,"Yeah, Im not in favor of new pieces of legislation on  on guns and taking guns away or making certain guns illegal. We, of course, dont want to have automatic weapons, and thats already illegal in this country to have automatic weapons. What I believe is we have to do, as the president mentioned towards the end of his remarks there, which is to make enormous efforts to enforce the gun laws that we have, and to change the culture of violence that we have. And you ask how  how are we going to do that? And there are a number of things. He mentioned good schools. I totally agree. We were able to drive our schools to be number one in the nation in my state. And I believe if we do a better job in education, well  well give people the  the hope and opportunity they deserve and perhaps less violence from that. But let me mention another thing. And that is parents. We need moms and dads, helping to raise kids. Wherever possible the  the benefit of having two parents in the home, and thats not always possible. A lot of great single moms, single dads. But gosh to tell our kids that before they have babies, they ought to think about getting married to someone, thats a great idea. Because if theres a two parent family, the prospect of living in poverty goes down dramatically. The opportunities that the child will  will be able to achieve increase dramatically. So we can make changes in the way our culture works to help bring people away from violence and give them opportunity, and bring them in the American system. The  the greatest failure weve had with regards to  to gun violence in some respects is what  what is known as Fast and Furious. Which was a program under this administration, and how it worked exactly I think we dont know precisely, where thousands of automatic, and AK-47 type weapons were  were given to people that ultimately gave them to  to drug lords. They used those weapons against  against their own citizens and killed Americans with them. And this was a  this was a program of the government. For what purpose it was put in place, I cant imagine. But its one of the great tragedies related to violence in our society which has occurred during this administration. Which I think the American people would like to understand fully, its been investigated to a degree, but  but the administration has carried out executive privilege to prevent all of the information from coming out.",2012-10-16,Republican
Crowley,"Governor, Governor, if I could, the question was about these assault weapons that once were once banned and are no longer banned.",2012-10-16,Moderator

And its referred to as an assault weapon ban, but it had, at the signing of the bill, both the pro-gun and the anti-gun people came together, because it provided opportunities for both that both wanted. There were hunting opportunities, for instance, that havent previously been available and so forth, so it was a mutually agreed- upon piece of legislation. Thats what we need more of, Candy. What we have right now in Washington is a place thats gridlocked.",2012-10-16,Republican

Crowley,"Quickly, Mr. President.",2012-10-16,Moderator
Obama,"The  first of all, I think Governor Romney was for an assault weapons ban before he was against it. And he said that the reason he changed his mind was, in part, because he was seeking the endorsement of the National Rifle Association. So thats on the record. But I think that one area we agree on is the important of parents and the importance of schools, because I do believe that if our young people have opportunity, then they are less likely to engage in these kinds of violent acts. Were not going to eliminate everybody who is mentally disturbed and we have got to make sure they dont get weapons. But we can make a difference in terms ensuring that every young person in America, regardless of where they come from, what they look like, have a chance to succeed. And, Candy, we havent had a chance to talk about education much, but I think it is very important to understand that the reforms weve put in place, working with 46 governors around the country, are seeing schools that are some of the ones that are the toughest for kids starting to succeed. Were starting to see gains in math and science. When it comes to community colleges, we are setting up programs, including with Nassau Community College, to retrain workers, including young people who may have dropped out of school but now are getting another chance, training them for the jobs that exist right now. And in fact, employers are looking for skilled workers. And so were matching them up. Giving them access to higher education. As I said, we have made sure that millions of young people are able to get an education that they werent able to get before.",2012-10-16,Democrat

Crowley,"OK. Thank you so much. I want to ask Carol Goldberg to stand up, because she gets to a question that both these men have been passionate about. Its for Governor Romney.",2012-10-16,Moderator
Romney,"Boy, great question and important question, because youre absolutely right. The place where weve seen manufacturing go has been China. China is now the largest manufacturer in the world. It used to be the United States of America. A lot of good people have lost jobs. A half a million manufacturing jobs have been lost in the last four years. Thats total over the last four years. One of the reasons for that is that people think its more attractive in some cases to go offshore than to stay here. We have made it less attractive for enterprises to stay here than to go offshore from time to time. What I will do as president is make sure its more attractive to come to America again. This is the way were going to create jobs in this country. Its not by trickle-down government, saying were going to take more money from people and hire more government workers, raise more taxes, put in place more regulations. Trickle-down government has never worked here, has never worked anywhere. I want to make America the most attractive place in the world for entrepreneurs, for small business, for big business, to invest and grow in America. Now, were going to have to make sure that as we trade with other nations that they play by the rules. And China hasnt. One of the reasons  or one of the ways they dont play by the rules is artificially holding down the value of their currency. Because if they put their currency down low, that means their prices on their goods are low. And that makes them advantageous in the marketplace. We lose sales. And manufacturers here in the U.S. making the same products cant compete. China has been a currency manipulator for years and years and years. And the president has a regular opportunity to label them as a currency manipulator, but refuses to do so. On day one, I will label China a currency manipulator, which will allow me as president to be able to put in place, if necessary, tariffs where I believe that they are taking unfair advantage of our manufacturers. So were going to make sure that people we trade with around the world play by the rules. But let me  let me not just stop there. Dont forget, whats key to bringing back jobs here is not just finding someone else to punish, and Im going to be strict with people who we trade with to make sure they  they follow the law and play by the rules, but its also to make America the most attractive place in the world for businesses of all kinds. Thats why I want to down the tax rates on small employers, big employers, so they want to be here. Canadas tax rate on companies is now 15 percent. Ours is 35 percent. So if youre starting a business, where would you rather start it? We have to be competitive if were going to create more jobs here. Regulations have quadrupled. The rate of regulations quadrupled under this president. I talk to small businesses across the country. They say, We feel like were under attack from our own government. I want to make sure that regulators see their job as encouraging small business, not crushing it. And theres no question but that Obamacare has been an extraordinary deterrent to enterprises of all kinds hiring people. My priority is making sure that we get more people hired. If we have more people hired, if we get back manufacturing jobs, if we get back all kinds of jobs into this country, then youre going to see rising incomes again. The reason incomes are down is because unemployment is so high. I know what it takes to get this to happen, and my plan will do that, and one part of it is to make sure that we keep China playing by the rules.",2012-10-16,Republican
Crowley,"Mr. President, two minutes here, because we are then going to go to our last question.",2012-10-16,Moderator
Obama,"OK. We need to create jobs here. And both Governor Romney and I agree actually that we should lower our corporate tax rate. Its too high. But theres a difference in terms of how we would do it. I want to close loopholes that allow companies to deduct expenses when they move to China; that allow them to profit offshore and not have to get taxed, so they have tax advantages offshore. All those changes in our tax code would make a difference. Now, Governor Romney actually wants to expand those tax breaks. One of his big ideas when it comes to corporate tax reform would be to say, if you invest overseas, you make profits overseas, you dont have to pay U.S. taxes. But, of course, if youre a small business or a mom-and-pop business or a big business starting up here, youve got to pay even the reduced rate that Governor Romneys talking about. And its estimated that that will create 800,000 new jobs. The problem is theyll be in china. Or India. Or Germany. Thats not the way were going to create jobs here. The way were going to create jobs here is not just to change our tax code, but also to double our exports. And we are on pace to double our exports, one of the commitments I made when I was president. Thats creating tens of thousands of jobs all across the country. Thats why weve kept on pushing trade deals, but trade deals that make sure that American workers and American businesses are getting a good deal. Now, Governor Romney talked about China, as I already indicated. In the private sector, Governor Romneys company invested in what were called pioneers of outsourcing. Thats not my phrase. Thats what reporters called it. And as far as currency manipulation, the currency has actually gone up 11 percent since Ive been president because we have pushed them hard. And weve put unprecedented trade pressure on China. Thats why exports have significantly increased under my presidency. Thats going to help to create jobs here.",2012-10-16,Democrat
Crowley,"Mr. President, we have a really short time for a quick discussion here.",2012-10-16,Moderator
Romney,"The answer is very straightforward. We can compete with anyone in the world as long as the playing field is level. Chinas been cheating over the years. One by holding down the value of their currency. Number two, by stealing our intellectual property; our designs, our patents, our technology. Theres even an Apple store in China thats a counterfeit Apple store, selling counterfeit goods. They hack into our computers. We will have to have people play on a fair basis, thats number one.",2012-10-16,Republican

Obama,"Candy, there are some jobs that are not going to come back. Because they are low wage, low skill jobs. I want high wage, high skill jobs. Thats why we have to emphasize manufacturing. Thats why we have to invest in advanced manufacturing. Thats why weve got to make sure that weve got the best science and research in the world. And when we talk about deficits, if were adding to our deficit for tax cuts for folks who dont need them, and were cutting investments in research and science that will create the next Apple, create the next new innovation that will sell products around the world, we will lose that race. If were not training engineers to make sure that they are equipped here in this country. Then companies wont come here. Those investments are whats going to help to make sure that we continue to lead this world economy, not just next year, but 10 years from now, 50 years from now, 100 years from now.",2012-10-16,Democrat

Romney,"Thank you, and thats an opportunity for me, and I appreciate it. In the nature of a campaign, it seems that some campaigns are focused on attacking a person rather than prescribing their own future and the things theyd like to do. In the course of that, I think the presidents campaign has tried to characterize me as  as someone whos very different than who I am. I care about 100 percent of the American people. I want 100 percent of the American people to have a bright and prosperous future. I care about our kids. I understand what it takes to make a bright and prosperous future for America again. I spent my life in the private sector, not in government. Im a guy who wants to help with the experience I have, the American people. My  my passion probably flows from the fact that I believe in God. And I believe were all children of the same God. I believe we have a responsibility to care for one another. I  I served as a missionary for my church. I served as a pastor in my congregation for about 10 years. Ive sat across the table from people who were out of work and worked with them to try and find new work or to help them through tough times. I went to the Olympics when they were in trouble to try and get them on track. And as governor of my state, I was able to get 100 percent of my people insured, all my kids, about 98 percent of the adults. I was able also to get our schools ranked number one in the nation, so 100 percent of our kids would have a bright opportunity for a future.",2012-10-16,Republican

We dont have to settle for unemployment at a chronically high level. We dont have to settle for 47 million people on food stamps. We dont have to settle for 50 percent of kids coming out of college not able to get work. We dont have to settle for 23 million people struggling to find a good job. If I become president, Ill get America working again. I will get us on track to a balanced budget. The president hasnt. I will.

Obama,"Barry, I think a lot of this campaign, maybe over the last four years, has been devoted to this nation that I think government creates jobs, that that somehow is the answer. Thats not what I believe. I believe that the free enterprise system is the greatest engine of prosperity the worlds ever known. I believe in self-reliance and individual initiative and risk takers being rewarded. But I also believe that everybody should have a fair shot and everybody should do their fair share and everybody should play by the same rules, because thats how our economys grown. Thats how we built the worlds greatest middle class. And  and that is part of whats at stake in this election. Theres a fundamentally different vision about how we move our country forward. I believe Governor Romney is a good man. Loves his family, cares about his faith. But I also believe that when he said behind closed doors that 47 percent of the country considered themselves victims who refuse personal responsibility, think about who he was talking about. Folks on Social Security whove worked all their lives. Veterans whove sacrificed for this country. Students who are out there trying to hopefully advance their own dreams, but also this countrys dreams. Soldiers who are overseas fighting for us right now. People who are working hard every day, paying payroll tax, gas taxes, but dont make enough income. And I want to fight for them. Thats what Ive been doing for the last four years. Because if they succeed, I believe the country succeeds. When my grandfather fought in World War II and he came back and he got a G.I. Bill and that allowed him to go to college, that wasnt a handout. That was something that advanced the entire country. And I want to make sure that the next generation has those same opportunities.

Now, I believe, also, that this meeting this mission, this responsibility for preserving the peace, which I believe is a responsibility peculiar to our country, and that we cannot shirk our responsibility as a leader of the free world because were the only ones that can do it. Therefore, the burden of maintaining the peace falls on us. And to maintain that peace requires strength. America has never gotten in a war because we were too strong. We can get into a war by letting events get out of hand, as they have in the last three and a half years under the foreign policies of this Administration of Mr. Carters, until were faced each time with a crisis. And good management in preserving the peace requires that we control the events and try to intercept before they become a crisis. I have seen four wars in my lifetime. Im a father of sons; I have a grandson. I dont ever want to see another generation of young Americans bleed their lives into sandy beachheads in the Pacific, or rice paddies and jungles in the in Asia or the muddy battlefields of Europe.",1980-10-28,Republican
Mr. Smith,"Mr. Stone, do you have a follow-up question for the Governor?",1980-10-28,Moderator
Mr. Stone,"Yes. Governor, weve been hearing that the defense build-up that you would associate yourself with would cost tens of billions of dollars more than is now contemplated. Assuming that the American people are ready to bear this cost, they nevertheless keep asking the following question: How do you reconcile huge increases in military outlays with your promise of substantial tax cuts and of balancing the budget, which in this fiscal year, the one that just ended, ran more than $60 billion in the red?",1980-10-28,Moderator
Mr. Reagan,"Mr. Stone, I have submitted an economic plan that I have worked out in concert with a number of fine economists in this country, all of whom approve it, and believe that over a five year projection, this plan can permit the extra spending for needed refurbishing of our defensive posture, that it can provide for a balanced budget by 1983 if not earlier, and that we can afford  along with the cuts that I have proposed in Government. spending  we can afford the tax cuts I have proposed and probably mainly because Mr. Carters economic policy has built into the next five years, and on beyond that, a tax increase that will be taking $86 billion more out of the peoples pockets than was taken this year. And my tax cut does not come close to eliminating that $86 billion increase. Im only reducing the amount of the increase. In other words, what Im talking about is not putting government back to getting less money than governments been getting, but simply cutting the increase in in spending.",1980-10-28,Republican
Mr. Smith,"The same question now goes to President Carter. President Carter, would you like to have the question repeated?",1980-10-28,Moderator
Mr. Stone,"Yes, President Carter, the question of war and peace, a central issue in this campaign. Youve been criticized for, in the give and take, for responding late to aggressive Soviet impulses, for an insufficient build-up of our armed forces, and a paralysis in dealing with Afghanistan and Iran. Governor Reagan, on the other hand, has been criticized for being all too quick to advocate the use of lots of muscle  military action  to deal with foreign crises such as I have mentioned. Specifically, what are the differences between the two of you on the uses of American military power?",1980-10-28,Moderator
Mr. Carter,"Mr. Stone, Ive had to make thousands of decisions since Ive been President, serving in the Oval Office. And with each one of those decisions that affect the future of my country, I have learned in the process. I think Im a much wiser and more experienced man than I was when I debated four years ago against President Ford. Ive also learned that there are no simple answers to complicated questions. H. L. Mencken said that for every problem theres a simple answer. It would be neat and plausible and wrong. The fact is that this nation, in the eight years before I became President, had its own military strength decreased. Seven out of eight years, the budget commitments for defense went down, 37% in all. Since Ive been in office, weve had a steady, carefully planned, methodical but, very effective increase in our commitment for defense. But what weve done is use that enormous power and prestige and military strength of the United States to preserve the peace. Weve not only kept peace for our own country, but weve been able to extend the benefits of peace to others. In the Middle East, weve worked for a peace treaty between Israel and Egypt, successfully, and have tied ourselves together with Israel and Egypt in a common defense capability. This is a very good step forward for our nations security, and well continue to do as we have done in the past. I might also add that there are decisions that are made in the Oval Office by every President which are profound in nature. There are always trouble spots in the world, and how those troubled areas are addressed by a President alone in that Oval Office affects our nation directly, the involvement of the United States and also our American interests. That is a basic decision that has to be made so frequently, by every President who serves. That is what I have tried to do successfully by keeping our country at peace.",1980-10-28,Democrat
Mr. Smith,"Mr. Stone, do you have a follow-up for?",1980-10-28,Moderator
Mr. Stone,"Yes. I would like to be a little more specific on the use of military power and lets talk about one area for a moment. Under what circumstances would you use military forces to deal with, for example, a shut-off of the Persian Oil Gulf [sic] if that should occur, or to counter Russian expansion beyond Afghanistan into either Iran or Pakistan? I ask this question in view of charges that we are woefully unprepared to project sustained  and I emphasize the word sustained  power in that part of the world.",1980-10-28,Moderator
Mr. Carter,"Mr. Stone, in my State of the Union address earlier this year, I pointed out that any threat to the stability or security of the Persian Gulf would be a threat to the security of our own country. In the past, we have not had an adequate military presence in that region. Now we have two major carrier task forces. We have access to facilities in five different areas of that region. And weve made it clear that working with our allies and others, that we are prepared to address any foreseeable eventuality which might interrupt commerce with that crucial area of the world. But in doing this, we have made sure that we address this question peacefully, not injecting American military forces into combat, but letting the strength of our nation be felt in a beneficial way. This, I believe, has assured that our interests will be protected in the Persian Gulf region, as we have done in the Middle East and throughout the world.",1980-10-28,Democrat
Mr. Smith,"Governor Reagan, you have a minute to comment or rebut.",1980-10-28,Moderator
Mr. Reagan,"Well yes, I question the figure about the decline in defense spending under the two previous Administrations in the preceding eight years to this Administration. I would call to your attention that we were in a war that wound down during those eight years, which of course made a change in military spending because of turning from war to peace. I also would like to point out that Republican presidents in those years, faced with a Democratic majority in both houses of the Congress, found that their requests for defense budgets were very often cut. Now, Gerald Ford left a five-year projected plan for a military build-up to restore our defenses, and President Carters administration reduced that by 38%, cut 60 ships out of the Navy building program that had been proposed, and stopped the the B-l, delayed the cruise missile, stopped the production line for the Minuteman missile, stopped the Trident or delayed the Trident submarine, and now is planning a mobile military force that can be delivered to various spots in the world which does make me question his assaults on whether I am the one who is quick to look for use of force.",1980-10-28,Republican
Mr. Smith,"President Carter, you have the last word on this question.",1980-10-28,Moderator
Mr. Carter,"Well, there are various elements of defense. One is to control nuclear weapons, which I hope well get to later on because that is the most important single issue in this campaign. Another one is how to address troubled areas of the world. I think, habitually, Governor Reagan has advocated the injection of military forces into troubled areas, when I and my predecessors  both Democrats and Republicans  have advocated resolving those troubles in those difficult areas of the world peacefully, diplomatically, and through negotiation. In addition to that, the build-up of military forces is good for our country because weve got to have military strength to preserve the peace. But Ill always remember that the best weapons are the ones that are never fired in combat, and the best soldier is one who never has to lay his life down on the field of battle. Strength is imperative for peace, but the two must go hand in hand.",1980-10-28,Democrat
Mr. Smith,Thank you gentlemen. The next question is from Harry Ellis to President Carter.,1980-10-28,Moderator
Mr. Carter,"Again its important to put the situation in perspective. In 1974, we had a so-called oil shock, wherein the price of OPEC oil was raised to an extraordinary degree. We had an even worse oil shock in 1979. In 1974, we had the worst recession, the deepest and most penetrating recession since the Second World War. The recession that resulted this time was the briefest since the Second World War. In addition, weve brought down inflation. Earlier this year, in the first quarter, we did have a very severe inflation pressure brought about by the OPEC price increase. It averaged about 18% in the first quarter of this year. In the second quarter, we had dropped it down to about 13%. The most recent figures, the last three months, on the third quarter of this year, the inflation rate is 7%  still too high, but it illustrates very vividly that in addition to providing an enormous number of jobs  nine million new jobs in the last three and a half years  that the inflationary threat is still urgent on us. I notice that Governor Reagan recently mentioned the Reagan-Kemp-Roth proposal. which his own running mate, George Bush, described as voodoo economics, and said that it would result in a 30% inflation rate. And Business Week, which is not a Democratic publication, said that this Reagan-Kemp-Roth proposal  and I quote them, I think  was completely irresponsible and would result in inflationary pressures which would destroy this nation. So our proposals are very sound and very carefully considered to stimulate jobs, to improve the industrial complex of this country, to create tools for American workers, and at the same time would be anti-inflationary in nature. So to add nine million new jobs, to control inflation, and to plan for the future with an energy policy now intact as a foundation is our plan for the years ahead.",1980-10-28,Democrat
Mr. Smith,"Mr. Ellis, do you have a follow-up question for Mr. Carter?",1980-10-28,Moderator
Mr. Ellis,"Yes. Mr. President, you have mentioned the creation of nine million new jobs. At the same time, the unemployment rate still hangs high, as does the inflation rate. Now, I wonder, can you tell us what additional policies you would pursue in a second administration in order to try to bring down that inflation rate? And would it be an act of leadership to tell the American people they are going to have to sacrifice to adopt a leaner lifestyle for some time to come?",1980-10-28,Moderator
Mr. Carter,"Yes. We have demanded that the American people sacrifice, and they have done very well. As a matter of fact, were importing today about one-third less oil from overseas than we did just a year ago. Weve had a 25% reduction since the first year I was in office. At the same time, as I have said earlier, we have added about nine million net new jobs in that period of time  a record never before achieved. Also, the new energy policy has been predicated on two factors: One is conservation, which requires sacrifice, and the other one, increase in production of American energy, which is going along very well  more coal this year than ever before in American history, more oil and gas wells drilled this year than ever before in history. The new economic revitalization program that we have in mind, which will be implemented next year, would result in tax credits which would let business invest in new tools and new factories to create even more new jobs  about one million in the next two years. And we also have planned a youth employment program which would encompass 600,000 jobs for young people. This has already passed the House, and it has an excellent prospect to pass the Senate.",1980-10-28,Democrat
Mr. Smith,"Now, the same question goes to Governor Reagan. Governor Reagan, would you like to have the question repeated?",1980-10-28,Moderator
Mr. Ellis,"Governor Reagan, during the past four years, the Consumer Price Index has risen from 4.8% to currently over 12%. And perhaps more significantly, the nations broader, underlying rate of inflation has gone up from 7% to 9%. Now, a part of that has been due to external factors beyond U.S. control, notably the more than doubling of OPEC oil prices last year, which leads me to ask you whether, since the United States remains vulnerable to such external shocks, can inflation in fact be controlled? If so, specifically what measures would you pursue`?",1980-10-28,Moderator
Mr. Reagan,"Mr. Ellis, I think this idea that has been spawned here in our country that inflation somehow came upon us like a plague and therefore its uncontrollable and no one can do anything about it, is entirely spurious and its dangerous to say this to the people. When Mr. Carter became President, inflation was 4.8%, as you said. It had been cut in two by President Gerald Ford. It is now running at 12.7%. President Carter also has spoken of the new jobs created. Well, we always, with the normal growth in our country and increase in population, increase the number of jobs. But that cant hide the fact that there are eight million men and women out of work in America today, and two million of those lost their jobs in just the last few months. Mr. Carter had also promised that he would not use unemployment as a tool to fight against inflation. And yet, his 1980 economic message stated that we would reduce productivity and gross national product and increase unemployment in order to get a handle on inflation, because in January, at the beginning of the year, it was more than 18%. Since then, he has blamed the people for inflation, OPEC, he has blamed the Federal Reserve system, he has blamed the lack of productivity of the American people, he has then accused the people of living too well and that we must share in scarcity, we must sacrifice and get used to doing with less. We dont have inflation because the people are living too well. We have inflation because the Government is living too well. And the last statement, just a few days ago, was a speech to the effect that we have inflation because Government revenues have not kept pace with Government spending. I see my time is running out here. Ill have to get this out very fast. Yes, you can lick inflation by increasing productivity and by decreasing the cost of government to the place that we have balanced budgets, and are no longer grinding out printing press money, flooding the market with it because the Government is spending more than it takes in. And my economic plan calls for that. The Presidents economic plan calls for increasing the taxes to the point that we finally take so much money away from the people that we can balance the budget in that way. But we will have a very poor nation and a very unsound economy if we follow that path.",1980-10-28,Republican
Mr. Smith,"A follow-up, Mr. Ellis?",1980-10-28,Moderator
Mr. Ellis,"Yes. You have centered on cutting Government spending in what you have just said about your own policies. You have also said that you would increase defense spending. Specifically, where would you cut Government spending if you were to increase defense spending and also cut taxes, so that, presumably. Federal revenues would shrink?",1980-10-28,Moderator
Mr. Reagan,"Well. most people, when they think about cutting Government spending, they think in terms of eliminating necessary programs or wiping out something, some service that Government is supposed to perform. I believe that there is enough extravagance and fat in government. As a matter of fact, one of the secretaries of HEW under Mr. Carter testified that he thought there was $7 billion worth of fraud and waste in welfare and in the medical programs associated with it. Weve had the Central Accounting. Office estimate that there is probably tens of billions of dollars that is lost in fraud alone, and they have added that waste adds even more to that. We have a program for a gradual reduction of Government spending based on these theories, and I have a task force now that has been working on where those cuts could be made. Im confident that it can be done and that it will reduce inflation because I did it in California. And inflation went down below the national average in California when we returned the money to the people and reduced Government spending.",1980-10-28,Republican
Mr. Smith,President Carter.,1980-10-28,Moderator
Mr. Carter,"Governor Reagans proposal, the Reagan-Kemp-Roth proposal, is one of the most highly inflationary ideas that ever has been presented to the American public. He would actually have to cut Government spending by at least $130 billion in order to balance the budget under this ridiculous proposal. I notice that his task force that is working for his future plans had some of their ideas revealed in The Wall Street Journal this week. One of those ideas was to repeal the minimum wage, and several times this year, Governor Reagan has said that the major cause of unemployment is the minimum wage. This is a heartless kind of approach to the working families of our country, which is typical of many Republican leaders of the past, but, I think, has been accentuated under Governor Reagan. In California  Im surprised Governor Reagan brought this up  he had the three largest tax increases in the history of that state under his administration. He more than doubled state spending while he was Governor  122% increase  and had between a 20% and 30% increase in the number of employees",1980-10-28,Democrat
Mr. Smith,"Sorry to interrupt, Mr. Carter.",1980-10-28,Moderator
Mr. Carter,"in California. Thank you, sir.",1980-10-28,Democrat
Mr. Smith,Governor Reagan has the last word on this question.,1980-10-28,Moderator
Mr. Reagan,"Yes. The figures that the President has just used about California is a distortion of the situation there, because while I was Governor of California, our spending in California increased less per capita than the spending in Georgia while Mr. Carter was Governor of Georgia in the same four years. The size of government increased only one-sixth in California of what it increased in proportion to the population in Georgia. And the idea that my tax-cut proposal is inflationary: I would like to ask the President why is it inflationary to let the people keep more of their money and spend it the way that they like, and it isnt inflationary to let him take that money and spend it the way he wants?",1980-10-28,Republican
Mr. Smith,"I wish that question need not be rhetorical, but it must be because weve run out of time on that. Now, the third question to Governor Reagan from William Hilliard.",1980-10-28,Moderator
Mr. Reagan,"I have been talking to a number of Congressmen who have much the same idea that I have, and that is that in the inner city areas, that in cooperation with the local government and the national Government, and using tax incentives and with cooperating with the private sector, that we have development zones. Let the local entity, the city, declare this particular area, based on the standards of the percentage of people on welfare, unemployed, and so forth, in that area. And then, through tax incentives, induce the creation of businesses providing jobs and so forth in those areas. The elements of government through these tax incentives For example, a business that would not have, for a period of time, an increase in the property tax reflecting its development of the unused property that it was making wouldnt be any loss to the city because the city isnt getting any tax from that now. And there would simply be a delay, and on the other hand, many of the people who would then be given jobs are presently wards of the Government and it wouldnt hurt to give them a tax incentive, because they that wouldnt be costing Government anything either. I think there are things to do in this regard. I stood in the South Bronx on the exact spot that President Carter stood on in 1977. You have to see it to believe it. It looks like a bombed-out city  great, gaunt skeletons of buildings. Windows smashed out, painted on one of them Unkept promises; on another, Despair. And this was the spot at which President Carter had promised that he was going to bring in a vast program to rebuild this department. There are whole or this area there are whole blocks of land that are left bare, just bulldozed down flat. And nothing has been done, and they are now charging to take tourists there to see this terrible desolation. I talked to a man just briefly there who asked me one simple question: Do I have reason to hope that I can someday take care of my family again? Nothing has been done.",1980-10-28,Republican
Mr. Smith,Follow-up. Mr. Hilliard:,1980-10-28,Moderator
Mr. Hilliard,"Yes. Governor Reagan. Blacks and other non-whites are increasing. in numbers in our cities. Many of them feel that they are facing a hostility from whites that prevents them from joining the economic mainstream of our society. There is racial confrontation in the schools, on jobs, and in housing, as non-whites seek to reap the benefits of a free society. What do you think is the nations future as a multi-racial society?",1980-10-28,Moderator
Mr. Reagan,"I believe in it. I am eternally optimistic, and I happen to believe that weve made great progress from the days when I was young and when this country didnt even know it had a racial problem. I know those things can grow out of despair in an inner city, when theres hopelessness at home, lack of work, and so forth. But I believe that all of us together, and I believe the Presidency is what Teddy Roosevelt said it was. Its a bully pulpit. And I think that something can be done from there, because a goal for all of us should be that one day, things will be done neither because of nor in spite of any of the differences between us  ethnic differences or racial differences, whatever they may be  that we will have total equal opportunity for all people. And I would do everything I could in my power to bring that about.",1980-10-28,Republican
Mr. Smith,"Mr. Hilliard, would you repeat your question for President Carter?",1980-10-28,Moderator
Mr. Hilliard,"President Carter. the decline of our cities has been hastened by the continual rise in crime, strained race relations, the fall in the quality of public education, persistence of abnormal poverty in a rich nation, and a decline in services to the public. The signs seem to point toward deterioration that could lead to the establishment of a permanent underclass in the cities. What, specifically, would you do in the next four years to reverse this trend.",1980-10-28,Moderator
Mr. Carter,"Thank you, Mr. Hilliard. When I was campaigning in 1976, everywhere I went, the mayors and local officials were in despair about the rapidly deteriorating central cities of our nation. We initiated a very fine urban renewal program, working with the mayors, the governors, and other interested officials. This has been a very successful effort. Thats one of the main reasons that weve had such an increase in the number of people employed. Of the nine million people put to work in new jobs since Ive been in office, 1.3 million of those has been among black Americans, and another million among those who speak Spanish. We now are planning to continue the revitalization program with increased commitments of rapid transit, mass transit. Under the windfall profits tax, we expect to spend about $43 billion in the next 10 years to rebuild the transportation systems of our country. We also are pursuing housing programs. Weve had a 73% increase in the allotment of Federal funds for improved education. These are the kinds of efforts worked on a joint basis with community leaders, particularly in the minority areas of the central cities that have been deteriorating so rapidly in the past. Its very important to us that this be done with the full involvement of minority citizens. I have brought into the top level, top levels of government, into the White House, into administrative offices of the Executive branch, into the judicial system, highly qualified black and Spanish citizens and women who in the past had been excluded. I noticed that Governor Reagan said that when he was a young man that there was no knowledge of a racial problem in this country. Those who suffered from discrimination because of race or sex certainly knew we had a racial problem. We have gone a long way toward correcting these problems, but we still have a long way to go.",1980-10-28,Democrat
Mr. Smith,Follow-up question?,1980-10-28,Moderator
Mr. Hilliard,"Yes. President Carter, I would like to repeat the same follow-up to you. Blacks and other non-whites are increasing in numbers in our cities. Many of them feel that they are facing a hostility from whites that prevents them from joining the economic mainstream of our society. There is racial confrontation in the schools, on jobs, and in housing, as non-whites seek to reap the benefits of a free society. What is your assessment of the nations future as a multi-racial society?",1980-10-28,Moderator
Mr. Carter,"Ours is a nation of refugees, a nation of immigrants. Almost all of our citizens came here from other lands and now have hopes, which are being realized, for a better life, preserving their ethnic commitments, their family structures, their religious beliefs, preserving their relationships with their relatives in foreign countries, but still holding themselves together in a very coherent society, which gives our nation its strength. In the past, those minority groups have often been excluded from participation in the affairs of government. Since Ive been President, Ive appointed, for instance, more than twice as many black Federal judges as all previous presidents in the history of this country. Ive done the same thing in the appointment of women, and also Spanish-speaking Americans. To involve them in the administration of government and the feeling that they belong to the societal structure that makes decisions in the judiciary and in the executive branch is a very important commitment which I am trying to realize and will continue to do so in the future.",1980-10-28,Democrat
Mr. Smith,"Governor Reagan, you have a minute for rebuttal.",1980-10-28,Moderator
Mr. Reagan,"Yes. The President talks of Government programs, and they have their place. But as governor, when I was at that end of the line and receiving some of these grants for Government programs, I saw that so many of them were dead-end. They were public employment that these people who really want to get out into the private job market where there are jobs with a future. Now, the President spoke a moment ago about that I was against the minimum wage. I wish he could have been with me when I sat with a group of teenagers who were black, and who were telling me about their unemployment problems, and that it was the minimum wage that had done away with the jobs that they once could get. And indeed, every time it has increased you will find there is an increase in minority unemployment among young people. And therefore, I have been in favor of a separate minimum for them. With regard to the great progress that has been made with this Government spending, the rate of black unemployment in Detroit, Michigan, is 56%.",1980-10-28,Republican
Mr. Smith,"President Carter, you have the last word on this question.",1980-10-28,Moderator
Mr. Carter,"Its obvious that we still have a long way to go in fully incorporating the minority groups into the mainstream of American life. We have made good progress, and there is no doubt in my mind that the commitment to unemployment compensation, the minimum wage, welfare, national health insurance, those kinds of commitments that have typified the Democratic party since ancient history in this countrys political life are a very important element of the future. In all those elements, Governor Reagan has repeatedly spoken out against them, which, to me, shows a very great insensitivity to giving deprived families a better chance in life. This, to me, is a very important difference between him and me in this election, and I believe the American people will judge accordingly. There is no doubt in my mind that in the downtown central cities, with the, with the new commitment on an energy policy, with a chance to revitalize homes and to make them more fuel efficient, with a chance for our synthetic fuels program, solar power, this will give us an additional opportunity for jobs which will pay rich dividends.",1980-10-28,Democrat
Mr. Smith,"Now, a question from Barbara Walters.",1980-10-28,Moderator
Barbara Walters,"Mr. President, the eyes of the country tonight are on the hostages in Iran. I realize this is a sensitive area, but the question of how we respond to acts of terrorism goes beyond this current crisis. Other countries have policies that determine how they will respond. Israel, for example, considers hostages like soldiers and will not negotiate with terrorists. For the future, Mr. President, the country has a right to know, do you have a policy for dealing with terrorism wherever it might happen, and, what have we learned from this experience in Iran that might cause us to do things differently if this, or something similar, happens again?",1980-10-28,Moderator
Mr. Carter,"Barbara, one of the blights on this world is the threat and the activities of terrorists. At one of the recent economic summit conferences between myself and the other leaders of the western world, we committed ourselves to take strong action against terrorism. Airplane hijacking was one of the elements of that commitment. There is no doubt that we have seen in recent years  in recent months  additional acts of violence against Jews in France and, of course, against those who live in Israel, by the PLO and other terrorist organizations. Ultimately, the most serious terrorist threat is if one of those radical nations, who believe in terrorism as a policy, should have atomic weapons. Both I and all my predecessors have had a deep commitment to controlling the proliferation of nuclear weapons. In countries like Libya or Iraq, we have even alienated some of our closest trade partners because we have insisted upon the control of the spread of nuclear weapons to those potentially terrorist countries. When Governor Reagan has been asked about that, he makes the very disturbing comment that non-proliferation, or the control of the spread of nuclear weapons, is none of our business. And recently when he was asked specifically about Iraq, he said there is nothing we can do about it. This ultimate terrorist threat is the most fearsome of all, and its part of a pattern where our country must stand firm to control terrorism of all kinds.",1980-10-28,Democrat
Mr. Smith,"Ms. Walters, a follow up?",1980-10-28,Moderator
Ms. Walters,"While we are discussing policy, had Iran not taken American hostages. I assume that, in order to preserve our neutrality, we would have stopped the flow of spare parts and vital war materials once war broke out between Iraq and Iran. Now were offering to lift the ban on such goods if they let our people come home. Doesnt this reward terrorism, compromise our neutrality, and possibly antagonize nations now friendly to us in the Middle East?",1980-10-28,Moderator
Mr. Carter,"We will maintain our position of neutrality in the Iran and Iraq war. We have no plans to sell additional materiel or goods to Iran, that might be of a warlike nature. When I made my decision to stop all trade with Iran as a result of the taking of our hostages, I announced then, and have consistently maintained since then, that if the hostages are released safely, we would make delivery on those items which Iran owns  which they have bought and paid for  also, that the frozen Iranian assets would be released. Thats been a consistent policy, one I intend to carry out.",1980-10-28,Democrat
Mr. Smith,"Would you repeat the question now for Governor Reagan, please, Ms. Walters?",1980-10-28,Moderator
Ms. Walters,"Yes. Governor, the eyes of the country tonight remain on the hostages in Iran, but the question of how we respond to acts of terrorism goes beyond this current crisis. There are other countries that have policies that determine how they will respond. Israel, for example, considers hostages like soldiers and will not negotiate with terrorists. For the future, the country has the right to know, do you have a policy for dealing with terrorism wherever it might happen, and what have we learned from this experience in Iran that might cause us to do things differently if this, or something similar, should happen again?",1980-10-28,Moderator
Mr. Reagan,"Barbara, youve asked that question twice. I think you ought to have at least one answer to it. I have been accused lately of having a secret plan with regard to the hostages. Now, this comes from an answer that Ive made at least 50 times during this campaign to the press, when I am asked have you any ideas of what you would do if you were there? And I said, well, yes. And I think that anyone thats seeking this position, as well as other people, probably, have thought to themselves, what about this, what about that? These are just ideas of what I would think of if I were in that position and had access to the information, and which I would know all the options that were open to me. I have never answered the question, however; second, the one that says, well, tell me, what are some of those ideas? First of all, I would be fearful that I might say something that was presently under way or in negotiations, and thus expose it and endanger the hostages, and sometimes, I think some of my ideas might require quiet diplomacy where you dont say in advance, or say to anyone, what it is youre thinking of doing. Your question is difficult to answer, because, in the situation right now, no one wants to say anything that would inadvertently delay, in any way, the return of those hostages if there if there is a chance that theyre coming home soon, or that might cause them harm. What I do think should be done, once they are safely here with their families, and that tragedy is over  weve endured this humiliation for just lacking one week of a year now  then, I think, it is time for us to have a complete investigation as to the diplomatic efforts that were made in the beginning, why they have been there so long, and when they came home, what did we have to do in order to bring that about  what arrangements were made? And I would suggest that Congress should hold such an investigation. In the meantime, Im going to continue praying that theyll carne home.",1980-10-28,Republican
Mr. Smith,Follow up question.,1980-10-28,Moderator
Ms. Walters,"I would like to say that neither candidate answered specifically the question of a specific policy for dealing with terrorism, but I will ask Governor Reagan a different follow-up question. You have suggested that there would be no Iranian crisis had you been President, because we would have given firmer support to the Shah. But Iran is a country of 37 million people who are resisting a government that they regarded as dictatorial. My question is not whether the Shahs regime was preferable to the Ayatollahs, but whether the United States has the power or the right to try to determine what form of government any country will have, and do we back unpopular regimes whose major merit is that they are friendly to the United States?",1980-10-28,Moderator
Mr. Reagan,"The degree of unpopularity of a regime when the choice is total authoritarianism totalitarianism, I should say, in the alternative government, makes one wonder whether you are being helpful to the people. And weve been guilty of that. Because someone didnt meet exactly our standards of human rights, even though they were an ally of ours, instead of trying patiently to persuade them to change their ways, we have, in a number of instances, aided a revolutionary overthrow which results in complete totalitarianism, instead, for those people. I think that this is a kind of a hypocritical policy when, at the same time, were maintaining a detente with the one nation in the world where there are no human rights at all  the Soviet Union. Now, there was a second phase in the Iranian affair in which we had something to do with that. And that was, we had adequate warning that there was a threat to our embassy, and we could have done what other embassies did  either strengthen our security there, or remove our personnel before the kidnap and the takeover took place.",1980-10-28,Republican
Mr. Smith,"Governor, Im sorry, I must interrupt. President Carter, you have a minute for rebuttal.",1980-10-28,Moderator
Mr. Carter,"I didnt hear any comment from Governor Reagan about what he would do to stop or reduce terrorism in the future. What the Western allies did decide to do is to stop all air flights  commercial air flights  to any nation involved in terrorism or the hijacking of air planes, or the harboring of hijackers. Secondly, we all committed ourselves, as have all my predecessors in the Oval Office not to permit the spread of nuclear weapons to a terrorist nation, or to any other nation that does not presently have those weapons or capabilities for explosives. Third, not to make any sales of materiel or weapons to a nation which is involved in terrorist activities. And, lastly, not to deal with the PLO until and unless the PLO recognizes Israels right to exist and recognizes UN Resolution 242 as a basis for Middle East peace. These are a few of the things to which our nation is committed, and we will continue with these commitments.",1980-10-28,Democrat
Mr. Smith,"Governor Reagan, you have the last word on that question.",1980-10-28,Moderator
Mr. Reagan,"Yes. I have no quarrel whatsoever with the things that have been done, because I believe it is high time that the civilized countries of the world made it plain that there is no room worldwide for terrorism; there will be no negotiation with terrorists of any kind. And while I have a last word here, I would like to correct a misstatement of fact by the President. I have never made the statement that he suggested about nuclear proliferation and nuclear proliferation, or the trying to halt it, would be a major part of a foreign policy of mine.",1980-10-28,Republican

In the second half, the panelists with me will have no follow-up questions. Instead, after the panelists have asked a question, and the candidates have answered, each of the candidates will have two opportunities to follow up,. to question, to rebut, or just to comment on his opponents statement. Governor Reagan will respond, in this section, to the first question from Marvin Stone.",1980-10-28,Moderator
Mr. Stone,"Governor Reagan  arms control: The President said it was the single most important issue. Both of you have expressed the desire to end the nuclear arms race with Russia, but by methods that are vastly different. You suggest that we scrap the SALT II treaty already negotiated, and intensify the build-up of American power to induce the Soviets to sign a new treaty  one more favorable to us. President Carter, on the other hand, says he will again try to convince a reluctant Congress to ratify the present treaty on the grounds its the best we can hope to get. Now, both of you cannot be right. Will you tell us why you think you are?",1980-10-28,Moderator
Mr. Reagan,"Yes. I think Im right because I believe that we must have a consistent foreign policy, a strong America, and a strong economy. And then, as we build up our national security, to restore our margin of safety, we at the same time try to restrain the Soviet build-up, which has been going forward at a rapid pace, and for quite some time. The SALT II treaty was the result of negotiations that Mr. Carters team entered into after he had asked the Soviet Union for a discussion of actual reduction of nuclear strategic weapons. And his emissary, I think, came home in 12 hours having heard a very definite nyet. But taking that one no from the Soviet Union, we then went back into negotiations on their terms, because Mr. Carter had canceled the B-I bomber, delayed the MX, delayed the Trident submarine, delayed the cruise missile, shut down the Missile Man  the three  the Minuteman missile production line, and whatever other things that might have been done. The Soviet Union sat at the table knowing that we had gone forward with unilateral concessions without any reciprocation from them whatsoever. Now, I have not blocked the SALT II treaty, as Mr. Carter and Mr. Mondale suggest I have. It has been blocked by a Senate in which there is a Democratic majority. Indeed, the Senate Armed Services Committee voted 10 to 0, with seven abstentions, against the SALT II treaty, and declared that it was not in the national security interests of the United States. Besides which, it is illegal, because the law of the land, passed by Congress, says that we cannot accept a treaty in which we are not equal. And we are not equal in this treaty for one reason alone  our B-2 bombers are considered to be strategic weapons; their Backfire bombers are not.",1980-10-28,Republican
Mr. Smith,"Governor, I have to interrupt you at that point. The time is up for that. But the same question now to President Carter.",1980-10-28,Moderator
Mr. Stone,"Yes. President Carter, both of you have expressed the desire to end the nuclear arms race with Russia, but through vastly different methods. The Governor suggests we scrap the SALT II treaty which you negotiated in Vienna or signed in Vienna, intensify the build-up of American power to induce the Soviets to sign a new treaty, one more favorable to us. You, on the other hand, say you will again try to convince a reluctant Congress to ratify the present treaty on the grounds it is the best we can hope to get from the Russians. You cannot both be right. Will you tell us why you think you are?",1980-10-28,Moderator
Mr. Carter,"Yes, Id be glad to. Inflation. unemployment, the cities are all very important issues, but they pale into insignificance in the life and duties of a President when compared with the control of nuclear weapons. Every President who has served in the Oval Office since Harry Truman has been dedicated to the proposition of controlling nuclear weapons. To negotiate with the Soviet Union a balanced, controlled, observable, and then reducing levels of atomic weaponry, there is a disturbing pattern in the attitude of Governor Reagan. He has never supported any of those arms control agreements  the limited test ban, SALT I, nor the Antiballistic Missile Treaty, nor the Vladivostok Treaty negotiated with the Soviet Union by President Ford  and now he wants to throw into the wastebasket a treaty to control nuclear weapons on a balanced and equal basis between ourselves and the Soviet Union, negotiated over a seven-year period, by myself and my two Republican predecessors. The Senate has not voted yet on the Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty. There have been preliminary skirmishing in the committees of the Senate, but the Treaty has never come to the floor of the Senate for either a debate or a vote. Its understandable that a Senator in the preliminary debates can make an irresponsible statement, or, maybe, an ill-advised statement. Youve got 99 other senators to correct that mistake, if it is a mistake. But when a man who hopes to be President says, take this treaty, discard it, do not vote, do not debate, do not explore the issues, do not finally capitalize on this long negotiation  that is a very dangerous and disturbing thing.",1980-10-28,Democrat
Mr. Smith,"Governor Reagan, you have an opportunity to rebut that. REAGAV: Yes, Id like to respond very much. First of all, the Soviet Union if I have been critical of some of the previous agreements, its because weve been out-negotiated for quite a long time. And they have managed, in spite of all of our attempts at arms limitation, to go forward with the biggest military build-up in the history of man. Now, to suggest that because two Republican presidents tried to pass the SALT treaty  that puts them on its side  I would like to say that President Ford, who was within 90% of a treaty that we could be in agreement with when he left office, is emphatically against this SALT treaty. I would like to point out also that senators like Henry Jackson and Hollings of South Carolina  they are taking the lead in the fight against this particular treaty. I am not talking of scrapping. I am talking of taking the treaty back, and going back into negotiations. And I would say to the Soviet Union, we will sit and negotiate with you as long as it takes, to have not only legitimate arms limitation, but to have a reduction of these nuclear weapons to the point that neither one of us represents a threat to the other. That is hardly throwing away a treaty and being opposed to arms limitation.",1980-10-28,Moderator
Mr. Smith,President Carter?,1980-10-28,Moderator
Mr. Carter,"Yes. Governor Reagan is making some very misleading and disturbing statements. He not only advocates the scrapping of this treaty  and I dont know that these men that he quotes are against the treaty in its final form  but he also advocates the possibility, he said its been a missing element, of playing a trump card against the Soviet Union of a nuclear arms race, and is insisting upon nuclear superiority by our own nation, as a predication for negotiation in the future with the Soviet Union. If President Brezhnev said, we will scrap this treaty, negotiated under three American Presidents over a seven-year period of time, we insist upon nuclear superiority as a basis for future negotiations, and we believe that the launching of a nuclear arms race is a good basis for future negotiations, its obvious that I, as President, and all Americans, would reject such a proposition. This would mean the resumption of a very dangerous nuclear arms race. It would be very disturbing to American people. It would change the basic tone and commitment that our nation has experienced ever since the Second World War, with al Presidents, Democratic and Republican. And it would also be very disturbing to our allies, all of whom support this nuclear arms treaty. In addition to that, the adversarial relationship between ourselves and the Soviet Union would undoubtedly deteriorate very rapidly. This attitude is extremely dangerous and belligerent in its tone, although its said with a quiet voice.",1980-10-28,Democrat
Mr. Smith,Governor Reagan?,1980-10-28,Moderator
Mr. Reagan,"I know the Presidents supposed to be replying to me, but sometimes, I have a hard time in connecting what hes saying, with what I have said or what my positions are. I sometimes think hes like the witch doctor that gets mad when a good doctor comes along with a cure thatll work. My point I have made already, Mr. President, with regard to negotiating: it does not call for nuclear superiority on the part of the United States. It calls for a mutual reduction of these weapons, as I say, that neither of us can represent a threat to the other. And to suggest that the SALT II treaty that your negotiators negotiated was just a continuation, and based on all of the preceding efforts by two previous Presidents, is just not true. It was a new negotiation because, as I say, President Ford was within about 10% of having a solution that could be acceptable. And I think our allies would be very happy to go along with a fair and verifiable SALT agreement.",1980-10-28,Republican
Mr. Smith,"President Carter, you have the last word on this question.",1980-10-28,Moderator
Mr. Carter,"I think, to close out this discussion, it would be better to put into perspective what were talking about. I had a discussion with my daughter, Amy, the other day, before I came here, to ask her what the most important issue was. She said she thought nuclear weaponry  and the control of nuclear arms. This is a formidable force. Some of these weapons have 10 megatons of explosion. If you put 50 tons of TNT in each one of railroad cars, you would have a carload of TNT  a trainload of TNT stretching across this nation. Thats one major war explosion in a warhead. We have thousands, equivalent of megaton, or million tons, of TNT warheads. The control of these weapons is the single major responsibility of a President, and to cast out this commitment of all Presidents, because of some slight technicalities that can be corrected, is a very dangerous approach.",1980-10-28,Democrat
Mr. Smith,"We have to go to another question now, from Harry Ellis to President Carter.",1980-10-28,Moderator
Harry Ellis,"Mr. President, as you have said, Americans, through conservation, are importing much less oil today than we were even a year ago. Yet U.S. dependence on Arab oil as a percentage of total imports is today much higher than it was at the time of the 1973 Arab oil embargo, and for some time to came, the loss of substantial amounts of Arab oil could plunge the U.S. into depression. This means that a bridge must be built out of this dependence. Can the United States develop synthetic fuels and other alternative energy sources without damage to the environment, and will this process mean steadily higher fuel bills for American families?",1980-10-28,Moderator
Mr. Carter,"I dont think theres any doubt that, in the future, the cost of oil is going to go up. What Ive had as a basic commitment since Ive been President is to reduce our dependence on foreign oil. It can only be done in two ways: one, to conserve energy  to stop the waste of energy  and, secondly, to produce more American energy. Weve been very successful in both cases. Weve now reduced the importing of foreign oil in the last year alone by one-third. We imported today 2 million barrels of oil less than we did the same date just a year ago. This commitment has been opening up a very bright vista for our nation in the future, because with the windfall profits tax as a base, we now have an opportunity to use American technology and American ability and American natural resources to expand rapidly the production of synthetic fuels, yes; to expand rapidly the production of solar energy, yes; and also to produce the traditional kinds of American energy. We will drill more oil and gas wells this year than any year in history. Well produce more coal this year than any year in history. We are exporting more coal this year than any year in history. And we have an opportunity now with improved transportation systems and improved loading facilities in our ports, to see a very good opportunity on a world international market, to replace OPEC oil with American coal as a basic energy source. This exciting future will not only give us more energy security, but will also open up vast opportunities for Americans to live a better life and to have millions of new jobs associated with this new and very dynamic industry now in prospect because of the new energy policy that weve put into effect.",1980-10-28,Democrat
Mr. Smith,Would you repeat the question now for Governor Reagan?,1980-10-28,Moderator
Mr. Ellis,"Governor Reagan, Americans, through conservation, are importing much less oil today than we were even a year ago. And yet, U.S. reliance on Arab oil as a percentage of total imports is much higher today than it was during the 1973 Arab oil embargo. And the substantial loss of Arab oil could plunge the United States into depression. The question is whether the development of alternative energy sources, in order to reduce this dependence, can be done without damaging the environment, and will it mean for American families steadily higher fuel bills?",1980-10-28,Moderator
Mr. Reagan,"Im not so sure that it means steadily higher fuel costs, but I do believe that this nation has been portrayed for too long a time to the people as being energy-poor when it is energy-rich. The coal that the President mentioned  yes, we have it  and yet one-eighth of our total coal resources is not being utilized at all right now. The mines are closed down; there are 22000 miners out of work. Most of this is due to regulations which either interfere with the mining of it or prevent the burning of it:. With our modern technology, yes, we can burn our coal within the limits of the Clean Air Act. I think, as technology improves, well be able to do even better with that. The other thing is that we have only leased out  begun to explore  2% of our outer continental shelf for oil, where it is believed, by everyone familiar with that fuel and that source of energy, that there are vast supplies yet to be found. Our Government has, in the last year or so, taken out of multiple use millions of acres of public lands that once were  well, they were public lands subject to multiple use  exploration for minerals and so forth. It is believed that probably 70% of the potential oil in the United States is probably hidden in those lands, and no one is allowed to even go and explore to find out if it is there. This is particularly true of the recent efforts to shut down part of Alaska. Nuclear power: There were 36 power plants planned in this country. And let me add the word safety; it must be done with the utmost of safety. But 32 of those have given up and canceled their plans to build, and again, because Government regulations and permits, and so forth, take  make it take  more than twice as long to build a nuclear plant in the United States as it does to build one in Japan or in Western Europe. We have the sources here. We are energy rich, and coal is one of the great potentials we have.",1980-10-28,Republican
Mr. Smith,"President Carter, your comment?",1980-10-28,Moderator
Mr. Carter,"To repeat myself, we have this year the opportunity, which well realize, to produce 800 million tons of coal  an unequaled record in the history of our country. Governor Reagan says that this is not a good achievement, and he blames restraints on coal production on regulations  regulations that affect the life and the health and safety of miners, and also regulations that protect the purity of our air and the quality our water and our land. We cannot cast aside these regulations. We have a chance in the next 15 years, insisting upon the health and safety of workers in the mines, and also preserving the same high air and water pollution standards, to triple the amount of coal we produce. Governor Reagans approach to our energy policy, which has already proven its effectiveness, is to repeal, or to change substantially, the windfall profits tax  to return a major portion of $227 billion back to the oil companies; to do away with the Department of Energy; to short-circuit our synthetic fuels program; to put a minimal emphasis on solar power; to emphasize strongly nuclear power plants as a major source of energy in the future. He wants to put all our eggs in one basket and give that basket to the major oil companies.",1980-10-28,Democrat
Mr. Smith,Governor Reagan.,1980-10-28,Moderator
Mr. Reagan,"That is a misstatement, of course, of my position. I just happen to believe that free enterprise can do a better job of producing the things that people need than government can. The Department of Energy has a multi-billion-dollar budget in excess of $10 billion. It hasnt produced a quart of oil or a lump of coal, or anything else in the line of energy. And for Mr. Carter to suggest that I want to do away with the safety laws and with the laws that pertain to clean water and clean air, and so forth. As Governor of California, I took charge of passing the strictest air pollution laws in the United States  the strictest air quality law that has even been adopted in the United States. And we created an OSHA  an Occupational Safety and Health Agency  for the protection of employees before the Federal Government had one in place. And to this day, not one of its decisions or rulings has ever been challenged. So, I think some of those charges are missing the point. I am suggesting that there are literally thousands of unnecessary regulations that invade every facet of business, and indeed, very much of our personal lives, that are unnecessary; that Government can do without; that have added $130 billion to the cost of production in this country; and that are contributing their part to inflation. And I would like to see us a little more free, as we once were.",1980-10-28,Republican
Mr. Smith,"President Carter, another crack at that?",1980-10-28,Moderator
Mr. Carter,"Sure. As a matter of fact,. the air pollution standard laws that were passed in California were passed over the objections of Governor Reagan, and this is a very well-known fact. Also, recently, when someone suggested that the Occupational Safety and Health Act should be abolished, Governor Reagan responded, amen. The offshore drilling rights is a question that Governor Reagan raises often. As a matter of fact, in the proposal for the Alaska lands legislation, 100% of all the offshore lands would be open for exploration, and 95% of all the Alaska lands, where it is suspected or believed that minerals might exist. We have, with our five-year plan for the leasing of offshore lands, proposed more land to be drilled than has been opened up for drilling since this program first started in 1954. So were not putting restraints on American exploration, were encouraging it in every way we can.",1980-10-28,Democrat
Mr. Smith,"Governor Reagan, you have the last word on this question.",1980-10-28,Moderator
Mr. Reagan,"Yes. If it is a well-known fact that I opposed air pollution laws in California, the only thing I can possibly think of is that the President must be suggesting the law that the Federal Government tried to impose on the State of California  not a law, but regulations  that would have made it impossible to drive an automobile within the city limits of any California city, or to have a place to put it if you did drive it against their regulations. It would have destroyed the economy of California, and, I must say, we had the support of Congress when we pointed out how ridiculous this attempt was by the Environmental Protection Agency. We still have the strictest air control, or air pollution laws in the country. As for offshore oiling, only 2% now is so leased and is producing oil. The rest, as to whether the lands are going to be opened in the next five years or so  were already five years behind in what we should be doing. There is more oil now, in the wells that have been drilled, than has been taken out in 121 years that theyve been drilled.",1980-10-28,Republican
Mr. Smith,"Thank you Governor. Thank you, Mr. President. The next question goes to Governor Reagan from William Hilliard.",1980-10-28,Moderator
Mr. Hilliard,"Governor Reagan, wage earners in this country  especially the young  are supporting a Social Security system that continues to affect their income drastically. The system is fostering a struggle between the young and the old, and is drifting the country toward a polarization of these two groups. How much longer can the young wage earner expect to bear the ever-increasing burden of the Social Security system?",1980-10-28,Moderator
Mr. Reagan,"The Social Security system was based on a false premise, with regard to how fast the number of workers would increase and how fast the number of retirees would increase. It is actuarially out of balance, and this first became evident about 16 years ago, and some of us were voicing warnings then. Now, it is trillions of dollars out of balance, and the only answer that has come so far is the biggest single tax increase in our nations history  the payroll tax increase for Social Security  which will only put a band-aid on this and postpone the day of reckoning by a few years at most. What is needed is a study that I have proposed by a task force of experts to look into this entire problem as to how it can be reformed and made actuarially sound, but with the premise that no one presently dependent on Social Security is going to have the rug pulled out from under them and not get their check. We cannot frighten, as we have with the threats and the campaign rhetoric that has gone on in this campaign, our senior citizens  leave them thinking that in some way, theyre endangered and they would have no place to turn. They must continue to get those checks, and I believe that the system can be put on a sound actuarial basis. But its going to take some study and some work, and not just passing a tax increase to let the load  or the roof  fall in on the next administration.",1980-10-28,Republican
Mr. Smith,Would you repeat that question for President Carter?,1980-10-28,Moderator
Mr. Hilliard,"Yes. President Carter, wage earners in this country, especially the young, are supporting a Social Security System that continues to affect their income drastically. The system is fostering a struggle between young and old and is drifting the country toward a polarization of these two groups. How much longer can the young wage earner expect to bear the ever-increasing burden of the Social Security System?",1980-10-28,Moderator
Mr. Carter,"As long as there is a Democratic President in the White House, we will have a strong and viable Social Security System, free of the threat of bankruptcy. Although Governor Reagan has changed his position lately, on four different occasions, he has advocated making Social Security a voluntary system, which would, in effect, very quickly bankrupt it. I noticed also in The Wall Street Journal early this week, that a preliminary report of his task force advocates making Social Security more sound by reducing the adjustment in Social Security for the retired people to compensate for the impact of inflation. These kinds of approaches are very dangerous to the security, the well being and the peace of mind of the retired people of this country and those approaching retirement age. But no matter what it takes in the future to keep Social Security sound, it must be kept that way. And although there was a serious threat to the Social Security System and its integrity during the 1976 campaign and when I became President, the action of the Democratic Congress working with me has been to put Social Security back on a sound financial basis. That is the way it will stay.",1980-10-28,Democrat
Mr. Smith,Governor Reagan?,1980-10-28,Moderator
Mr. Reagan,"Well, that just isnt true. It has, as I said, delayed the actuarial imbalance falling on us for just a few years with that increase in taxes, and I dont believe we can go on increasing the tax, because the problem for the young people today is that they are paying in far more than they can ever expect to get out. Now, again this statement that somehow, I wanted to destroy it and I just changed my tune, that I am for voluntary Social Security, which would mean the ruin of it. Mr. President, the voluntary thing that I suggested many years ago was that with a young man orphaned and raised by an aunt who died, his aunt was ineligible for Social Security insurance because she was not his mother. And I suggested that if this is an insurance program, certainly the person who is paying in should be able to name his own beneficiary. That is the closest I have ever come to anything voluntary with Social Security. I, too, am pledged to a Social Security program that will reassure these senior citizens of ours that they are going to continue to get their money. There are some changes that I would like to make. I would like to make a change in the regulation that discriminates against a wife who works and finds that she then is faced with a choice between her fathers or her husbands benefits, if he dies first, or what she has paid in; but it does not recognize that she has also been paying in herself, and she is entitled to more than she presently can get. Id like to change that.",1980-10-28,Republican
Mr. Smith,President Carters rebuttal now.,1980-10-28,Moderator
Mr. Carter,"These constant suggestions that the basic Social Security System should be changed does call for concern and consternation among the aged of our country. It is obvious that we should have a commitment to them, that Social Security benefits should not be taxed and that there would be no peremptory change in the standards by which Social Security payments are made to retired people. We also need to continue to index Social Security payments, so that if inflation rises, the Social Security payments would rise a commensurate degree to let the buying power of a Social Security check continue intact. In the past, the relationship between Social Security and Medicare has been very important to providing some modicum of aid for senior citizens in the retention of health benefits. Governor Reagan, as a matter of fact, began his political career campaigning around this nation against Medicare. Now, we have an opportunity to move toward national health insurance, with an emphasis on the prevention of disease, an emphasis on out-patient care, not in-patient care; an emphasis on hospital cost containment to hold down the cost of hospital care far those who are ill, an emphasis on catastrophic health insurance, so that if a family is threatened with being wiped out economically because of a very high medical bill, then the insurance would help pay for it. These are the kinds of elements of a national health insurance, important to the American people. Governor Reagan, again, typically is against such a proposal.",1980-10-28,Democrat
Mr. Smith,Governor?,1980-10-28,Moderator
Mr. Reagan,"When I opposed Medicare, there was another piece of legislation meeting the same problem before the Congress. I happened to favor the other piece of legislation and thought that it would be better for the senior citizens and provide better care than the one that was finally passed. I was not opposing the principle of providing care for them. I was opposing one piece of legislation versus another. There is something else about Social Security. Of course, it doesnt come out of the payroll tax. It comes out of a general fund, but something should be done about it. I think it is disgraceful that the Disability Insurance Fund in Social Security finds checks going every month to tens of thousands of people who are locked up in our institutions for crime or for mental illness, and they are receiving disability checks from Social Security every month while a state institution provides for all of their needs and their care.",1980-10-28,Republican
Mr. Smith,"President Carter, you have the last word on this question.",1980-10-28,Moderator
Mr. Carter,"I think this debate on Social Security, Medicare, national health insurance typifies, as vividly any other subject tonight, the basic historical differences between the Democratic Party and Republican Party. The allusions to basic changes in the minimum wage is another, and the deleterious comments that Governor Reagan has made about unemployment compensation. These commitments that the Democratic Party has historically made to the working families of this nation have been extremely important to the growth in their stature and in a better quality of life for them. I noticed recently that Governor Reagan frequently quotes Democratic presidents in his acceptance address. I have never heard a candidate for President, who is a Republican, quote a Republican president, but when they get in office, they try to govern like Republicans. So, it is good fo the American people to remember that there is a sharp basic historical difference between Governor Reagan and me on these crucial issues  also, between the two parties that we represent.",1980-10-28,Democrat

When many voters go into that booth just a week from today, they will be voting their gut instinct about you men. You have already given us your reasons why people should vote for you, now would you please tell us for this your final question, why they should not vote for your opponent, why his Presidency could be harmful to the nation and, having examined both your opponents record and the man himself, tell us his greatest weakness.",1980-10-28,Moderator
Mr. Carter,"Barbara, reluctant as I am to say anything critical about Governor Reagan, I will try to answer your question. First of all, there is the historical perspective that I just described. This is a contest between a Democrat in the mainstream of my party, as exemplified by the actions that I have taken in the Oval Office the last four years, as contrasted with Governor Reagan, who in most cases does typify his party, but in some cases, there is a radical departure by him from the heritage of Eisenhower and others. The most important crucial difference in this election campaign, in my judgment, is the approach to the control of nuclear weaponry and the inclination to control or not to control the spread of atomic weapons to other nations who dont presently have it, particularly terrorist nations. The inclination that Governor Reagan has exemplified in many troubled times since he has been running for President  I think since 1968  to inject American military forces in places like North Korea, to put a blockade around Cuba this year, or in some instances, to project American forces into a fishing dispute against the small nation of Ecuador on the west coast of South America. This is typical of his long-standing inclination, on the use of American power, not to resolve disputes diplomatically and peacefully, but to show that the exercise of military power is best proven by the actual use of it. Obviously, no President wants war, and I certainly do not believe that Governor Reagan, if he were President, would want war, but a President in the Oval Office has to make a judgment on almost a daily basis about how to exercise the enormous power of our country for peace, through diplomacy, or in a careless way in a belligerent attitude which has exemplified his attitudes in the past.",1980-10-28,Democrat
Mr. Smith,"Barbara, would you repeat the question for Governor Reagan?",1980-10-28,Moderator
Ms. Walters,"Yes, thank you. Realizing that you may be equally reluctant to speak ill of your opponent, may I ask why people should not vote for your opponent, why his Presidency could be harmful to the nation, and having examined both your opponents record and the man himself, could you tell us his greatest weakness?",1980-10-28,Moderator
Mr. Reagan,"Well, Barbara, I believe that there is a fundamental difference  and I think it has been evident in most of the answers that Mr. Carter has given tonight  that he seeks the solution to anything as another opportunity for a Federal Government program. I happen to believe that the Federal Government has usurped powers of autonomy and authority that belong back at the state and local level. It has imposed on the individual freedoms of the people, and there are more of these things that could be solved by the people themselves, if they were given a chance, or by the levels of government that were closer to them. Now, as to why I should be and he shouldnt be, when he was a candidate in 1976, President Carter invented a thing he called the misery index. He added the rate of unemployment and the rate of inflation, and it came, at that time, to 12.5% under President Ford. He said that no man with that size misery index has a right to seek reelection to the Presidency. Today, by his own decision, the misery index is in excess of 20%, and I think this must suggest something. But, when I had quoted a Democratic President, as the President says, I was a Democrat. I said many foolish things back in those days. But the President that I quoted had made a promise, a Democratic promise, and I quoted him because it was never kept. And today, you would find that that promise is at the very heart of what Republicanism represents in this country today. Thats why I believe there are going to be millions of Democrats that are going to vote with us this time around, because they too want that promise kept. It was a promise for less government and less taxes and more freedom for the people.",1980-10-28,Republican

Mr. Carter,"I mentioned the radical departure of Governor Reagan from the principles or ideals of historical perspective of his own party. I dont think that can be better illustrated than in the case of guaranteeing women equal rights under the Constitution of our nation. For 40 years, the Republican Party platforms called for guaranteeing women equal rights with a constitutional amendment. Six predecessors of mine who served in the Oval Office called for this guarantee of womens rights. Governor Reagan and his new Republican Party have departed from this commitment  a very severe blow to the opportunity for women to finally correct discrimination under which they have suffered. When a man and a women do the same amount of work, a man gets paid $1.00, a women only gets paid 59 cents. And the equal rights amendment only says that equality of rights shall not be abridged for omen b the Federal Government or by he state governments. That is all it says a simple guarantee of equality of opportunity which typifies the Democratic arty, and which is a very important commitment of mine, as contrasted with Governor Reagans radical departure from the long-standing policy of his own party.",1980-10-28,Democrat
Mr. Smith,Governor Reagan?,1980-10-28,Moderator
Mr. Reagan,"Yes. Mr. President, once again, I happen to be against the amendment, because I think the amendment will take this problem out of the hands of elected legislators and put it in the hands f unelected judges. I am for equal rights, and while you have been in office for four ears and not one single state  and most f them have a majority of Democratic legislators  has added to the ratification r voted to ratify the equal rights amendment. While I was Governor, more than eight years ago, I found 14 separate instances where women were discriminated against in the body of California law, and I had passed and signed into law 14 statutes that eliminated those discriminations, including the economic ones that you have just mentioned  equal pay and so forth. I believe that if in all these years that we have spent trying to get the amendment, that we had spent as much time correcting these laws, as we did in California  and we were the first to do it. If I were President, I would also now take a look at the hundreds of Federal regulations which discriminate against women and which go right on while everyone is looking for an amendment. I would have someone ride herd on those regulations, and we would start eliminating those discriminations in the Federal Government against women.",1980-10-28,Republican

Mr. Carter,"Howard, Im a Southerner, and I share the basic beliefs of my region that an excessive government intrusion into the private affairs of American citizens and also into the private affairs of the free enterprise system. One of the commitments that I made was to deregulate the major industries of this country. Weve been remarkably successful, with the help of a Democratic Congress. We have deregulated the air industry, the rail industry, the trucking industry, financial institutions. Were now working on the communications industry. In addition to that, I believe that this element of discrimination is something that the South has seen so vividly as a blight on our region of the country which has now been corrected  not only racial discrimination but discrimination against people that have to work for a living  because we have been trying to pick ourselves up by our bootstraps, since the long depression years, and lead a full and useful life in the affairs of this country. We have made remarkable success. It is part of my consciousness and of my commitment to continue this progress. So, my heritage as a Southerner, my experience in the Oval Office, convinces me that what I have just described is a proper course for the future.",1980-10-28,Democrat
Mr. Smith,"Governor Reagan, yours is the last word.",1980-10-28,Moderator
Mr. Reagan,"Well, my last word is again to say this: We were talking about this very simple amendment and womens rights. And I make it plain again: I am for womens rights. But I would like to call the attention of the people to the fact that that so-called simple amendment would be used by mischievous men to destroy discriminations that properly belong, by law, to women respecting the physical differences between the two sexes, labor laws that protect them against things that would be physically harmful to them. Those would all, could all be challenged by men. And the same would be true with regard to combat service in the military and so forth. I thought that was the subject we were supposed to be on. But, if were talking about how much we think about the working people and so forth, Im the only fellow who ever ran for this job who was six times President of his own union and still has a lifetime membership in that union.",1980-10-28,Republican
Mr. Smith,"Gentlemen, each of you now has three minutes for a closing statement. President Carter, youre first.",1980-10-28,Moderator
Mr. Carter,"First of all, Id like to thank the League of Women Voters for making this debate possible. I think its been a very constructive debate and I hope its helped to acquaint the American people with the sharp differences between myself and Governor Reagan. Also, I want to thank the people of Cleveland and Ohio for being such hospitable hosts during these last few hours in my life. Ive been President now for almost four years. Ive had to make thousands of decisions, and each one of those decisions has been a learning process. Ive seen the strength of my nation, and Ive seen the crises it approached in a tentative way. And Ive had to deal with those crises as best I could. As Ive studied the record between myself and Governor Reagan, Ive been impressed with the stark differences that exist between us. I think the result of this debate indicates that that fact is true. I consider myself in the mainstream of my party. I consider myself in the mainstream even of the bipartisan list of Presidents who served before me. The United States must be a nation strong; the United States must be a nation secure. We must have a society thats just and fair. And we must extend the benefits of our own commitment to peace, to create a peaceful world. I believe that since Ive been in office, there have been six or eight areas of combat evolved in other parts of the world. In each case, I alone have had to determine the interests of my country and the degree of involvement of my country. Ive done that with moderation, with care, with thoughtfulness; sometimes consulting experts. But, Ive learned in this last three and a half years that when an issue is extremely difficult, when the call is very close, the chances are the experts will be divided almost 50-50. And the final judgment about the future of the nation  war, peace, involvement, reticence, thoughtfulness, care, consideration, concern  has to be made by the man in the Oval Office. Its a lonely job, but with the involvement of the American people in the process, with an open Government, the job is a very gratifying one. The American people now are facing, next Tuesday, a lonely decision. Those listening to my voice will have to make a judgment about the future of this country. And I think they ought to remember that one vote can make a lot of difference. If one vote per precinct had changed in 1960, John Kennedy would never have been President of this nation. And if a few more people had gone to the polls and voted in 1968, Hubert Humphrey would have been President; Richard Nixon would not. There is a partnership involved in our nation. To stay strong, to stay at peace, to raise high the banner of human rights, to set an example for the rest of the world, to let our deep beliefs and commitments be felt by others in other nations, is my plan for the future. I ask the American people to join me in this partnership.",1980-10-28,Democrat
Mr. Smith,Governor Reagan?,1980-10-28,Moderator
Mr. Reagan,"Yes, I would like to add my words of thanks, too, to the ladies of the League of Women Voters for making these debates possible. Im sorry that we couldnt persuade the bringing in of the third candidate, so that he could have been seen also in these debates. But still, its good that at least once, all three of us were heard by the people of this country. Next Tuesday is Election Day. Next Tuesday all of you will go to the polls, will stand there in the polling place and make a decision. I think when you make that decision, it might be well if you would ask yourself, are you better off than you were four years ago? Is it easier for you to go and buy things in the stores than it was four years ago? Is there more or less unemployment in the country than there was four years ago? Is America as respected throughout the world as it was? Do you feel that our security is as safe, that were as strong as we were four years ago? And if you answer all of those questions yes, why then, I think your choice is very obvious as to whom you will vote for. If you dont agree, if you dont think that this course that weve been on for the last four years is what you would like to see us follow for the next four, then I could suggest another choice that you have. This country doesnt have to be in the shape that it is in. We do not have to go on sharing in scarcity with the country getting worse off, with unemployment growing. We talk about the unemployment lines. If all of the unemployed today were in a single line allowing two feet for each of them, that line would reach from New York City to Los Angeles, California. All of this can be cured and all of it can be solved. I have not had the experience the President has had in holding that office, but I think in being Governor of California, the most populous state in the Union  if it were a nation, it would be the seventh-ranking economic power in the world  I, too, had some lonely moments and decisions to make. I know that the economic program that I have proposed for this nation in the next few years can resolve many of the problems that trouble us today. I know because we did it there. We cut the cost  the increased cost of government  in half over the eight years. We returned $5.7 billion in tax rebates, credits and cuts to our people. We, as I have said earlier, fell below the national average in inflation when we did that. And I know that we did give back authority and autonomy to the people. I would like to have a crusade today, and I would like to lead that crusade with your help. And it would be one to take Government off the backs of the great people of this country, and turn you loose again to do those things that I know you can do so well, because you did them and made this country great. Thank you.",1980-10-28,Republican
Quijano,"Good evening. From Longwood University in Farmville, Virginia, and welcome to the first, and only, vice presidential debate of 2016, sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates. Im Elaine Quijano, anchor at CBSN, and correspondent for CBS News. Its an honor to moderate this debate between Senator Tim Kaine and Governor Mike Pence. Both are longtime public servants who are also proud fathers of sons serving in the U.S. Marines. The campaigns have agreed to the rules of this 90-minute debate. There will be nine different segments covering domestic and foreign policy issues. Each segment will begin with a question to both candidates who will each have two minutes to answer. Then Ill ask follow-up questions to facilitate a discussion between the candidates. By coin toss, its been determined that Senator Kaine will be first to answer the opening question. Gentlemen, welcome. It truly is a privilege to be with both of you tonight. Id like to start with the topic of presidential leadership. Twenty-eight years ago tomorrow night, Lloyd Bentsen said the vice presidential debate was not about the qualifications for the vice presidency, but about how if tragedy should occur, the vice president has to step in without any margin for error, without time for preparation, to take over the responsibility for the biggest job in the world.",2016-10-04,Moderator
Kaine,"Elaine, thank you for being here tonight, and, Governor Pence, welcome. It is so great to be back at Longwood University in Farmville, Virginia. This is a very special place. Sixty-five years ago, a young, courageous woman, Barbara Johns, led a walkout of her high school, Moton High School. She made history by protesting school segregation. She believed our nation was stronger together. And that walkout led to the Brown v. Board of Education decision that moved us down the path toward equality. I am so proud to be running with another strong, history-making woman, Hillary Clinton, to be president of the United States. Im proud because her vision of stronger together, building an economy that works for all, not just those at the top, being safe in the world not only with a strong military, but also strong alliances to battle terrorism and climate change, and also to build a community of respect, just like Barbara Johns tried to do 65 years ago. Thats why Im so proud to be her running mate. Hillary told me why she asked me to be her running mate. She said the test of a Clinton administration will not be the signing of a bill or the passage of a bill. Itll be whether we can make somebodys life better, whether we can make a classroom better learning environment for schoolkids or teachers, whether we can make a safer  its going to be about results. And she said to me, youve been a missionary and a civil rights lawyer. Youve been a city councilman and mayor. Youve been a lieutenant governor and governor and now a U.S. senator. I think you will help me figure out how to govern this nation so that we always keep in mind that the success of the administration is the difference we make in peoples lives. And thats what I bring to the ticket, that experience having served at all levels of government. But my primary role is to be Hillary Clintons right-hand person and strong supporter as she puts together the most historic administration possible. And I relish that role. Im so proud of her. Ill just say this: We trust Hillary Clinton, my wife and I, and we trust her with the most important thing in our life. We have a son deployed overseas in the Marine Corps right now. We trust Hillary Clinton as president and commander-in-chief, but the thought of Donald Trump as commander-in-chief scares us to death.",2016-10-04,Democrat

Pence,"Well, first off, thank you, Elaine, and thank you to  thank you to Norwood University for their wonderful hospitality and the Commission on Presidential Debates. Its deeply humbling for me to be here, to be surrounded by my  my wonderful family. And, Senator Kaine, its an honor to be here with you, as well. And I just  I also want to say  I want to say thanks to everyone thats looking in tonight, who understands what an enormously important time this is in the life of our nation. For the last seven-and-a-half years, weve seen Americas place in the world weakened. Weve seen an economy stifled by more taxes, more regulation, a war on coal, and a failing health care reform come to be known as Obamacare, and the American people know that we need to make a change. And so I want to thank all of you for being  being with us tonight. I also want to thank Donald Trump for making that call and inviting us to be a part of this ticket. I have to tell you, Im a  Im a small-town boy from a place not too different from Farmville. I grew up with a cornfield in my backyard. My grandfather had immigrated to this country when he was about my sons age. My mom and dad built a  everything that matters in a small town in Southern Indiana. They built a family and  and a good name and a business. And they raised a family. And I dreamed some day of representing my home town in Washington, D.C., but I  honestly, Elaine, I never imagined  never imagined Id have the opportunity to be governor of the state that I love, let alone be sitting at a table like this in this kind of a position. So to answer your question, I would say I  I would hope that if  if the responsibility ever fell to me in this role, that I would meet it with the way that Im going to meet the responsibility should I be elected vice president of the United States. And thats to bring a lifetime of experience, a lifetime growing up in a small town, a lifetime where Ive served in the Congress of the United States, where  where Ive led a state that works in the great state of Indiana, and whatever other responsibilities might follow from this, I  I would hope and, frankly, I would pray to be able to meet that moment with that  that lifetime of experience.",2016-10-04,Republican
Quijano,"Senator Kaine, on the campaign trail, you praised Secretary Clintons character, including her commitment to public service, yet 60 percent of voters dont think shes trustworthy. Why do so many people distrust her? Is it because they have questions about her e-mails and the Clinton Foundation?",2016-10-04,Moderator
Kaine,"Elaine, let me tell you why I trust Hillary Clinton. Heres what people should look at as they look at a public servant. Do they have a passion in their life that showed up before they were in public life? And have they held onto that passion throughout their life, regardless of whether they were in office or not, succeeding or failing? Hillary Clinton has that passion. From a time as a kid in a Methodist youth group in the suburbs of Chicago, she has been focused on serving others with a special focus on empowering families and kids. As a civil rights lawyer in the South, with the Childrens Defense Fund, first lady of Arkansas and this country, senator, secretary of state, its always been about putting others first. And thats a sharp contrast with Donald Trump. Donald Trump always puts himself first. He built a business career, in the words of one of his own campaign staffers, off the backs of the little guy. And as a candidate, he started his campaign with a speech where he called Mexicans rapists and criminals, and he has pursued the discredited and really outrageous lie that President Obama wasnt born in the United States. It is so painful to suggest that we go back to think about these days where an African-American could not be a citizen of the United States. And I cant imagine how Governor Pence can defend the insult-driven selfish me first style of Donald Trump.",2016-10-04,Democrat
Quijano,"Governor Pence, let me ask you, you have said Donald Trump is, quote, thoughtful, compassionate, and steady.

Why do so many Americans think Mr. Trump is simply too erratic?",2016-10-04,Moderator
Pence,"Well, let me  let me say first and foremost that, Senator, you and Hillary Clinton would know a lot about an insult-driven campaign. It really is remarkable.

Pence,"I think the fact that  that under this past administration of which Hillary Clinton was a part, weve almost doubled the national debt is atrocious. I mean, Im very proud of the fact that  I come from a state that works. The state of Indiana has balanced budgets. We cut taxes, weve made record investments in education and in infrastructure, and I still finish my term with $2 billion in the bank. Thats a little bit different than when Senator Kaine was governor here in Virginia. He actually  he actually tried to raise taxes by about $4 billion. He left his state about $2 billion in the hole. In the state of Indiana, weve cut unemployment in half; unemployment doubled when he was governor. But I think hes a very fitting running mate for Hillary Clinton, because in the wake of a season where American families are struggling in this economy under the weight of higher taxes and Obamacare and the war on coal and the stifling avalanche of regulation coming out of this administration, Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine want more of the same. It really is remarkable that they actually are advocating a trillion dollars in tax increases, which I get that. You tried to raise taxes here in Virginia and were unsuccessful. But a trillion dollars in tax increases, more regulation, more of the same war on coal, and more of Obamacare that now even former President Bill Clinton calls Obamacare a crazy plan. But Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine want to build on Obamacare. They want to expand it into a single-payer program. And for all the world, Hillary Clinton just thinks Obamacare is a good start. Look, Donald Trump and I have a plan to get this economy moving again just the way that it worked in the 1980s, just the way it worked in the 1960s, and that is by lowering taxes across the board for working families, small businesses and family farms, ending the war on coal that is hurting jobs and hurting this economy even here in Virginia, repealing Obamacare lock, stock, and barrel, and repealing all of the executive orders that Barack Obama has signed that are stifling economic growth in this economy. We can get America moving again. Put on top of that the kind of trade deals thatll put the American worker first, and youve got a prescription for real growth. And when you get the economy growing, Elaine, thats when you can deal with the national debt. When we get back to 3.5 percent to 4 percent growth with Donald Trumps plan will do, then were going to have the resources to meet our nations needs at home and abroad, and were going to have the ability to bring down the national debt.",2016-10-04,Republican
Quijano,Senator Kaine?,2016-10-04,Moderator
Kaine,"Elaine, on the economy, theres a fundamental choice for the American electorate. Do you want a youre hired president in Hillary Clinton or do you want a youre fired president in Donald Trump? I think thats not such a hard choice. Hillary and I have a plan thats on the table thats a youre hired plan. Five components. First thing we do is we invest in manufacturing, infrastructure, and research in the clean energy jobs of tomorrow. Second thing is we invest in our workforce, from pre-K education to great teachers to debt-free college and tuition-free college for families that make less than $125,000 a year. Third, we promote fairness by raising the minimum wage, so you cant work full-time and be under the poverty level, and by paying women equal pay for equal work. Fourth, we promote small business growth, just as weve done in Virginia, to make it easier to start and grow small businesses. Hillary and I each grew up in small-business families. My dad, who ran an iron working and welding shop, is here tonight. And, fifth, we have a tax plan that targets tax relief to middle- class individuals and small businesses and asks those at the very top whove benefited as weve come out of recession to pay more. The Trump plan is a different plan. Its a youre fired plan. And theres two key elements to it. First, Donald Trump said wages are too high. And both Donald Trump and Mike Pence think we ought to eliminate the federal minimum wage. Mike Pence, when he was in Congress, voted against raising the minimum wage above $5.15. And he has been a one-man bulwark against minimum wage increases in Indiana. The second component of the plan is massive tax breaks for the very top, trillions of dollars of tax breaks for people just like Donald Trump. The problem with this, Elaine, is thats exactly what we did 10 years ago and it put the economy into the deepest recession  the deepest recession since the 1930s. Independent analysts say the Clinton plan would grow the economy by 10.5 million jobs. The Trump plan would cost 3.5 million jobs. And Donald Trump  why would he do this? Because his tax plan basically helps him. And if he ever met his promise and he gave his tax returns to the American public like he said he would, we would see just how much his economic plan is really a Trump-first plan.",2016-10-04,Democrat

And Social Security has enabled people to retire with dignity and overwhelmingly not be in poverty. We have to keep it solvent. And we will keep it solvent. And well look for strategies like adjusting the payroll tax cap upward in order to do that. Heres what Hillary and I will not do. And I want to make this very plain. We will never, ever engage in a risky scheme to privatize Social Security. Donald Trump wrote a book and he said Social Security is a Ponzi scheme and privatization would be good for all of us. And when Congressman Pence was in Congress, he was the chief cheerleader for the privatization of Social Security.

Kaine,"Elaine, I think thats a very fair comment. I think we put a lot on police shoulders. And this is something I got a lot of scar tissue and experience on. I was a city councilman and mayor in Richmond. And when I came in, we had one of the highest homicide rates in the United States. We fought very, very hard over the course of my time in local office with our police department, and we reduced our homicide rate nearly in half. And then when I was governor of Virginia, we worked hard, too. And we did something we had really wanted to do. For the first time ever, we cracked the top 10, 10 safest states, because we worked together. Heres what I learned as a mayor and a governor. The way you make communities safer and the way you make police safer is through community policing. You build the bonds between the community and the police force, build bonds of understanding, and then when people feel comfortable in their communities, that gap between the police and the communities they serve narrows. And when that gap narrows, its safer for the communities and its safer for the police. That model still works across our country, but there are some other models that dont work, an overly aggressive, more militarized model. Donald Trump recently said we need to do more stop-and-frisk around the country. That would be a big mistake because it polarizes the relationship between the police and the community. So heres what well do. Well focus on community policing. We will focus on  and Hillary Clinton has rolled out a really comprehensive mental health reform package that she worked on with law enforcement professionals, and we will also fight the scourge of gun violence in the United States. Im a gun-owner. Im a strong Second Amendment supporter. But Ive got a lot of scar tissue, because when I was governor of Virginia, there was a horrible shooting at Virginia Tech, and we learned that through that painful situation that gaps in the background record check system should have been closed and it could have prevented that crime, and so were going to work to do things like close background record checks. And if we do, we wont have the tragedies that we did. One of those killed at Virginia Tech was a guy named Liviu Librescu. He was a 70-plus-year-old Romanian Holocaust survivor. He had survived the Holocaust. Then he survived the Soviet Union takeover of his country. But then he was a visiting professor at Virginia Tech, and he couldnt survive the scourge of gun violence. We can support the Second Amendment and do things like background record checks and make us safer, and that will make police safer, too.",2016-10-04,Democrat

My three brothers and I would marvel at my uncle when he would come out in his uniform, sidearm at his side. Police officers are the best of us. And the men and women, white, African-American, Asian, Latino, Hispanic, they put their lives on the line every single day. And let me say, at the risk of agreeing with you, community policing is a great idea. Its worked in the Hoosier state. And we fully support that. Donald Trump and I are going to make sure that law enforcement have the resources and the tools to be able to really restore law and order to the cities and communities in this nation. Its probably  probably why the 330,000 members of the Fraternal Order of Police endorsed Donald Trump as the next president of the United States of America, because they see his commitment to them. They see his commitment to law and order. But they also  they also hear the bad mouthing, the bad mouthing that comes from people that seize upon tragedy in the wake of police action shootings as  as a reason to  to use a broad brush to accuse law enforcement of  of implicit bias or institutional racism.

Kaine,"The terrorist threat has decreased in some ways, because bin Laden is dead. The terrorist threat has decreased in some ways because an Iranian nuclear weapons program has been stopped. The terrorist threat to United States troops has been decreased in some ways because theres not 175,000 in a dangerous part of the world. Theres only 15,000. But there are other parts of the world that are challenging. Let me tell you this: To beat terrorism, theres only one candidate who can do it, and its Hillary Clinton. Remember, Hillary Clinton was the senator from New York on 9/11. She was there at the World Trade Center when they were still searching for victims and survivors. Thats seared onto her, the need to beat terrorism. And shes got a plan to do it. She was part of the national security team that wiped out bin Laden. Heres her plan to defeat ISIL. First, weve got to keep taking out their leaders on the battlefield. She was part of the team that got bin Laden, and shell lead the team that will get Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the head of ISIS. Second, weve got to disrupt financing networks, third, disrupt their ability to recruit on the Internet, in their safe havens. But, fourth, we also have to work with allies to share and surge intelligence. Thats the Hillary Clinton plan; shes got the experience to do it. Donald Trump. Donald Trump cant start a Twitter war with Miss Universe without shooting himself in the foot. Donald Trump doesnt have a plan. He said, I have a secret plan, and then he said, Um, I know more than all the generals about ISIL. And then he said, Im going to call the generals to help me figure out a plan. And finally he said, Im going to fire all the generals. He doesnt have a plan. But he does have dangerous ideas. Heres four. He trash talks the military. The military is a disaster, John McCains no hero, the generals need all to be fired, and I know more than them. He wants to tear up alliances. NATO is obsolete, and well only work together with Israel if they pay big league.",2016-10-04,Democrat

And because Hillary Clinton failed to renegotiate a status of forces agreement that would have allowed some American combat troops to remain in Iraq and secure the hard fought gains the American soldier had won by 2009, ISIS was able to be literally conjured up out of the desert, and its overrun vast areas that the American soldier had won in Operation Iraqi Freedom. My heart breaks for the likes of Lance Cpl. Scott Zubowski. He fell in Fallujah in 2005. He fought hard through some of the most difficult days in Operation Iraqi Freedom, and he paid the ultimate sacrifice to defend our freedom and secure that nation. And that nation was secured in 2009. But because Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama failed to provide a status of forces agreement and leave sufficient troops in there, we are back at war. The president just ordered more troops on the ground. We are back at war in Iraq. And Scott Zubowski, whose mom would always come to Memorial Day events in Newcastle, Indiana, to see me, and Id always give her a hug and tell her were never going to forget her son and we never will, Scott Zubowski and the sacrifices the American soldier made were squandered in Iraq because this administration created a vacuum in which ISIS was able to grow.

Its, first, dramatically expanding our intelligence capacities by hiring great professionals, but also weve got some of the best intel and cyber employees in the world right here in the United States working for many of our private sector companies. So it involves increasing our own workforce, but striking great partnerships with some of our cyber and intel experts in the private sector so that we can, consistent with constitutional principles, gather more intelligence. But the second piece of this is really, really important. It also means creating stronger alliances, because you gather intelligence and then you share your intelligence back and forth with allies. And thats how you find out who may be trying to recruit, who may be trying to come from one country to the next. Alliances are critical.

Hillary Clintons top priority when she became secretary of state was the Russian reset, the Russian reset. After the Russian reset, the Russians invaded Ukraine and took over Crimea. And the small and bullying leader of Russia is now dictating terms to the United States to the point where all the United States of America  the greatest nation on Earth  just withdraws from talks about a cease-fire while Vladimir Putin puts a missile defense system in Syria while he marshals the forces and begins  look, we have got to begin to lean into this with strong, broad-shouldered American leadership. It begins by rebuilding our military. And the Russians and the Chinese have been making enormous investments in the military. We have the smallest Navy since 1916. We have the lowest number of troops since the end of the Second World War. Weve got to work with the Congress, and Donald Trump will, to rebuild our military and project American strength in the world. But about Aleppo and about Syria, I truly do believe that what America ought to do right now is immediately establish safe zones, so that families and vulnerable families with children can move out of those areas, work with our Arab partners, real time, right now, to make that happen. And secondly, I just have to tell you that the provocations by Russia need to be met with American strength. And if Russia chooses to be involved and continue, I should say, to be involved in this barbaric attack on civilians in Aleppo, the United States of America should be prepared to use military force to strike military targets of the Assad regime to prevent them from this humanitarian crisis that is taking place in Aleppo.

Donald Trump knew that happened. He basically was saying its not going to happen again. The truth of the matter is that what you have in the rise of aggressive Russia, which has had  increased its influence in Iran, thats now  now because of this deal is on a pathway in the future to obtain a nuclear  the leading state sponsor of terror in the world in Iran now has a closer working relationship with Russia because of Hillary Clinton and Barack Obamas foreign policy and $150 billion and sanctions all being lifted.",2016-10-04,Republican

Kaine,"Im going to talk about the foundation, and then Ill talk about North Korea. So, on the foundation. I am glad to talk about the foundation. The Clinton Foundation is one of the highest- rated charities in the world. It provides AIDS drugs to about 11.5 million people. It helps Americans deal with opioid overdoses. It gets higher rankings for its charity than the American Red Cross does. The Clinton Foundation does an awful lot of good work. Hillary Clinton as secretary of state took no action to benefit the foundation. The State Department did an investigation, and they concluded that everything Hillary Clinton did as secretary of state was completely in the interest of the United States. So the foundation does good work. And Hillary Clinton as secretary of state acted in the interests of the United States. But lets compare this now with the Trump organization and the Trump Foundation. The Trump organization is an octopus-like organization with tentacles all over the world whose conflict of interests could only be known if Donald Trump would release his tax returns. Hes refused to do it. His sons have said that the organization has a lot of business dealings in Russia. And remember, the Trump organization is not a non-profit. Its putting money into Donald Trumps pockets and into the pockets of his children, whereas the Clinton Foundation is a non-profit and no Clinton family member draws any salary.",2016-10-04,Democrat

Kaine,"If we  look, a president should take action to defend the United States against imminent threat. You have to. A president has to do that. Now exactly what action, you would have to determine what your intelligence was, how certain you were of that intelligence, but you would have to take action. You asked the question about how do we deal with a North Korea. Im on the Foreign Relations Committee. We just did an extensive sanctions package against North Korea. And interestingly enough, Elaine, the U.N. followed and did this  virtually the same package. Often China will use their veto in the Security Council to veto a package like that. Theyre starting to get worried about North Korea, too. So they actually supported the sanctions package, even though many of the sanctions are against Chinese firms, Chinese financial institutions. So were working together with China, and we need to. Chinas another one of those relationships where its competitive, its also challenging, and in times like North Korea, we have to be able to cooperate. Hillary understands that very well. She went once famously to China and stood up at a human rights meeting and looked them in the eye and said, Womens rights are human rights. They didnt want her to say that, but she did. But shes also worked on a lot of diplomatic and important diplomatic deals with China. And thats what its going to take. The thing I would worry a little bit about is that Donald Trump owes about $650 million to banks, including the Bank of China. Im not sure he could stand up so tough to the people who have loaned him money.",2016-10-04,Democrat
Quijano,"All right. Id like to turn to our next segment now. And in this, Id like to focus on social issues. You have both been open about the role that faith has played in your lives. Can you discuss in detail a time when you struggled to balance your personal faith and a public policy position? Senator Kaine?",2016-10-04,Moderator
Kaine,"Yeah, thats an easy one for me, Elaine. Its an easy one. Im really fortunate. I grew up in a wonderful household with great Irish Catholic parents. My mom and dad are sitting right here. I was educated by Jesuits at Rockhurst High School in Kansas City. My 40th reunion is in 10 days. And I worked with Jesuit missionaries in Honduras, now nearly 35 years ago, and they were the heroes of my life. I try to practice my religion in a very devout way and follow the teachings of my church in my own personal life. But I dont believe in this nation, a First Amendment nation, where we dont raise any religion over the other, and we allow people to worship as they please, that the doctrines of any one religion should be mandated for everyone. For me, the hardest struggle in my faith life was the Catholic Church is against the death penalty and so am I. But I was governor of a state, and the state law said that there was a death penalty for crimes if the jury determined them to be heinous. And so I had to grapple with that. When I was running for governor, I was attacked pretty strongly because of my position on the death penalty. But I looked the voters of Virginia in the eye and said, look, this is my religion. Im not going to change my religious practice to get one vote, but I know how to take an oath and uphold the law. And if you elect me, I will uphold the law. And I was elected, and I did. It was very, very difficult to allow executions to go forward, but in circumstances where I didnt feel like there was a case for clemency, I told Virginia voters I would uphold the law, and I did. That was a real struggle. But I think it is really, really important that those of us who have deep faith lives dont feel like we could just substitute our own views for everybody else in society, regardless of their views.",2016-10-04,Democrat
Quijano,Governor Pence?,2016-10-04,Moderator
Pence,"Well, its a wonderful question. And my Christian faith is at the very heart of who I am. I was also raised in a wonderful family of faith. It was a church on Sunday morning and grace before dinner. But my Christian faith became real for me when I made a personal decision for Christ when I was a freshman in college. And Ive tried to live that out however imperfectly every day of my life since. And with my wife at my side, weve followed a calling into public service, where weve  weve tried to  weve tried to keep faith with the values that we cherish. And with regard to when I struggle, I appreciate, and  and  and  I have a great deal of respect for Senator Kaines sincere faith. I truly do.",2016-10-04,Republican
Kaine,Thats shared.,2016-10-04,Democrat
Pence,"But for me, I would tell you that for me the sanctity of life proceeds out of the belief that  that ancient principle that  where God says before you were formed in the womb, I knew you, and so for my first time in public life, I sought to stand with great compassion for the sanctity of life. The state of Indiana has also sought to make sure that we expand alternatives in health care counseling for women, non-abortion alternatives. Im also very pleased at the fact were well on our way in Indiana to becoming the most pro-adoption state in America. I think if youre going to be pro-life, you should  you should be pro-adoption. But what I cant understand is with Hillary Clinton and now Senator Kaine at her side is to support a practice like partial-birth abortion. I mean, to hold to the view  and I know Senator Kaine, you hold pro-life views personally  but the very idea that a child that is almost born into the world could still have their life taken from them is just anathema to me. And I cannot  I cant conscience about  about a party that supports that. Or that  I know youve historically opposed taxpayer funding of abortion. But Hillary Clinton wants to  wants to repeal the longstanding provision in the law where we said we wouldnt use taxpayer dollars to fund abortion. So for me, my faith informs my life. I try and spend a little time on my knees every day. But it all for me begins with cherishing the dignity, the worth, the value of every human life.",2016-10-04,Republican
Kaine,"Elaine, this is a fundamental question, a fundamental question. Hillary and I are both people out of religious backgrounds, from Methodist church experience, which was really formative for her as a public servant. But we really feel like you should live fully and with enthusiasm the commands of your faith. But it is not the role of the public servant to mandate that for everybody else. So lets talk about abortion and choice. Lets talk about them. We support Roe v. Wade. We support the constitutional right of American women to consult their own conscience, their own supportive partner, their own minister, but then make their own decision about pregnancy. Thats something we trust American women to do that. And we dont think that women should be punished, as Donald Trump said they should, for making the decision to have an abortion. Governor Pence wants to repeal Roe v. Wade. He said he wants to put it on the ash heap of history. And we have some young people in the audience who werent even born when Roe was decided. This is pretty important. Before Roe v. Wade, states could pass criminal laws to do just that, to punish women if they made the choice to terminate a pregnancy. I think you should live your moral values. But the last thing, the very last thing that government should do is have laws that would punish women who make reproductive choices. And that is the fundamental difference between a Clinton-Kaine ticket and a Trump-Pence ticket that wants to punish women who make that choice.",2016-10-04,Democrat

But we do have to bring the country together. So heres what well do. Hillary Clinton was first lady, then senator for eight years and secretary of state. And I served in the Senate. And Im really amazed, Elaine, as I talk to Republican senators, how well they regard and respect Hillary Clinton. She was on the Armed Services Committee. She was on other committees. She worked across the aisle when she was first lady to get the CHIP program passed so that 8 million low-income kids have health insurance in this country, including 150,000 in Indiana. She worked across the aisle after 9/11 to get health benefits for the first responders who bravely went into the towers and into the Pentagon. She worked to get benefits for  TRICARE benefits for National Guard members, including Hoosiers and Virginians in the National Guard. She has a track record of working across the aisle to make things happen. And, you know, Elaine, I have the same track record. I was a governor of Virginia with two Republican houses. And in the Senate, I have good working relationships across the aisle. Because I think its fine to be a Democrat or Republican or independent, but after Election Day, the goal is work together. And Hillary Clinton has a track record of accomplishment across the aisle that will enable her to do just that when we work with the new Congress in January.",2016-10-04,Democrat

Pence," tonight. Thank you, Senator. This is a very challenging time in the life of our nation. Weakened Americas place in the world after the leadership of Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama on the world stage has been followed by an economy that is truly struggling, stifled by an avalanche of more taxes, more regulation, Obamacare, the war on coal, and the kind of trade deals that have put American workers in the back seat. I think the best way that we can bring people together is through change in Washington, D.C. You know, I served in Washington, D.C., for 12 years in the Congress of the United States. And I served with many Republicans and Democrats, men and women of goodwill. The potential is there to really change the direction of this country, but its going to take leadership to do it. The American people want to see our nation standing tall on the world stage again. They want to see us supporting our military, rebuilding our military, commanding the respect of the world, and they want to see the American economy off to the races again. They want to see an American comeback. And Donald Trumps entire career has been about building. Its been about  its going through hardship just like a businessperson does and finding a way through smarts and ingenuity and resilience to fight forward and  when Donald Trump becomes president of the United States, were going to have a stronger America. When you hear him say he wants to make America great again, when we do that, I truly do believe the American people are going to be standing taller. Theyre going to see that real change can happen after decades of just talking about it. And when that happens, the American people are going to stand tall, stand together, and well have the kind of unity thats been missing for way too long.",2016-10-04,Republican

From Farmville, Virginia, Im Elaine Quijano of CBS News. Good night.",2016-10-04,Moderator
Moderator,"Good evening from the Field House at Washington University in St. Louis. Im Jim Lehrer of the NewsHour on PBS. And I welcome you to this third and final Campaign 2000 debate between the Democratic candidate for president, Vice President Al Gore, and the Republican candidate, Governor George W. Bush of Texas. Lets welcome the candidates now. Before proceeding tonight we would like to observe a moment of silence in memory of Governor Mel Carnahan of Missouri, who along with his son and his former chief of staff, died in a private plane crash last night near St. Louis. A reminder, as we continue now, that these debates are sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates. The formats and the rules were worked out by the commission and the two campaigns. Tonights questions will be asked by St. Louis area voters who were identified as being uncommitted by the Gallup organization. Earlier today each of them wrote a question on a small card like this. Those cards were collected and then given to me this afternoon. My job, under the rules of the evening, was to decide the order the questions will be asked and to call on the questioners accordingly. I also have the option of asking follow-ups which  in order to get to more of the panels questions. For the record, I plan to do sparingly and mostly for clarifications. The audience participants are bound by the following rule. They shall not ask follow-up questions or otherwise participate in the extended discussion. And the questioners microphone will be turned off after he or she completes asking the question. Those are the rules. As in Winston-Salem last week, no single answer or response from a candidate can exceed two minutes. There is an audience here in the hall and they have promised to remain absolutely quiet, as did their predecessors this year in Boston, Danville, and Winston-Salem. Before we begin, a correction from last weeks debate. I was wrong when I said Vice President Gores campaign commercials had called Governor Bush a bumbler. That specific charge was made in a press statement by Gore campaign spokesman Mark Fabiani, not in a TV Guide.",2000-10-17,Moderator
Gore,Im glad you clarified that.,2000-10-17,Democrat
Moderator,"Now, lets go to the first question. Of over the 130 questions we received from this panel, we will begin with one of the 19 on health issues, and it goes to you, Mr. Vice President, and it will be asked by James Hankins. Mr. Hankins?",2000-10-17,Moderator
Gore,"Mr. Hankins, I dont feel good about it, and I think we ought to have a patients bill of rights to take the medical decisions away from the HMOs and give them back to the doctors and nurses. I want to come back and tell you why, but if you will forgive me, I would like to say something right now at the beginning of this debate following on the moment of silence for Mel Carnahan and Randy Carnahan and Chris Sifford. Tipper and I were good friends with Mel and Randy, and I know that all of us here want to extend our sympathy and condolences to Jean and the family and to the Sifford family. And I would just like to say that this debate in a way is a living tribute to Mel Carnahan because he loved the vigorous discussion of ideas in our democracy. He was a fantastic governor of Missouri. This state became one of the top five in the nation for health care coverage for children under his leadership. One of the best in advancing all kinds of benefits for children to grow up healthy and strong. And of course, this debate also takes place at a time when the tragedy of the USS Cole is on our minds and hearts and insofar as the memorial service is tomorrow, I would like to also extend sympathy to the families of those who have died and those who are still missing, and the injured. Now, Mr. Hankins, I think that the situation that you describe has gotten completely out of hand. Doctors are giving prescriptions, theyre recommending treatments, and then their recommendations are being overruled by HMOs and insurance companies. That is unacceptable. I support a strong national patients bill of rights. It is actually a disagreement between us, a national law that is pending on this, the Dingle-Norwood bill, a bipartisan bill, is one that I support and that the governor does not.",2000-10-17,Democrat
Moderator,"Two minutes response, Governor Bush.",2000-10-17,Moderator
Bush,"I, too, want to extend my prayers and blessings, Gods blessings on the families whose lives were overturned yes  tod  last night. Its a tragic moment. Actually, Mr. Vice President, its not true. I do support a national patients bill of rights. As a matter of fact, I brought Republicans and Democrats together to do just that in the State of Texas to get a patients bill of rights through. It requires a different kind of leadership style to do it, though. You see, in order to get something done on behalf of the people, you have to put partisanship aside, and thats what we did in my state. We have one of the most advanced patients bill of rights. It says, for example, that a woman doesnt have to go through a gate keeper to go to her gynecologist. It says that you cant gag a doctor, doctor can advise you. The HMO, the insurance company, cant gag that doctor from giving you full advice. And this particular bill, it allows patients to choose a doctor, their own doctor if they want to. But we did something else that was interesting. Were one of the first states that said you can sue an HMO for denying you proper coverage. Now theres whats called an Independent Review Organization that you have to go through first. It says if youve got a complaint with your insurance company, you can take your complaint to an objective body. If the objective body rules on your behalf, the insurance company must follow those rules. However, if the insurance company doesnt follow the findings of the IRO, then that becomes a cause of action in a court of law. Its time for our nation to come together and do whats right for the people, and I think this is right for the people. You know, I support a national patients bill of rights, Mr. Vice President, and I want all people covered. I dont want the law to supersede good law like weve got in Texas. I think",2000-10-17,Republican

So what I want to make sure is we understand here is before we go on to another question in the health area, would you agree that you two agree on a national patients bill of rights?",2000-10-17,Moderator
Gore,"Absolutely not. I referred to the Dingle-Norwood bill. It is the bipartisan bill that is now pending in the Congress. The HMOs and the insurance companies support the other bill thats pending, the one that the Republican majority has put forward. They like it because it doesnt accomplish what I think really needs to be accomplished to give the decisions back to the doctors and nurses and give you a right of appeal to somebody other than the HMO or insurance company, let you go to the nearest emergency room without having to call an HMO before you call 911, to let you see a specialist if you need to, and it has strong bipartisan support. It is being blocked by the Republican leadership in the Congress.",2000-10-17,Democrat

Bush,"Well, the difference is is that I can get it done. That I can get something positive done on behalf of the people. Thats what the question in this campaign is about. Its not only whats your philosophy and whats your position on issues, but can you get things done? And I believe I can.",2000-10-17,Republican
Gore,What about the Dingle-Norwood bill?,2000-10-17,Democrat
Moderator,All right. Were going to go now to another  all right. Yes.,2000-10-17,Moderator
Bush,"Im not quite through. Let me finish. I talked about the principles and the issues that I think are important in a patients bill of rights. Its kind of Washington, D.C. focus. Well, its in this committee or its got this sponsor. If Im the president, were going to have emergency room care, were going have gag orders, were going to have direct access to OB/GYN. People will be able to take their HMO insurance company to court. Thats what Ive done in Texas and thats the kind of leadership style Ill bring to Washington.",2000-10-17,Republican
Moderator,"All right. Another  the next question also on health issue is from  it will be asked by Marie Payne Kloepy, and it goes to Governor Bush.",2000-10-17,Moderator
Bush,"Well, thats a great question. I think one of the problems we have, particularly for seniors, is there is no prescription drug coverage in Medicare. And therefore, when they have to try to purchase drugs they do so on their own, theres no kind of collective bargaining, no power of purchasing among seniors. So I think step one to make sure prescription drugs is more affordable for seniors, and those are the folks who really rely upon prescription drugs a lot these days, is to reform the Medicare system, is to have prescription drugs as an integral part of Medicare once and for all. The problem we have today is like the patients bill of rights, particularly with health care, theres a lot of bickering in Washington, D.C. Its kind of like a political issue as opposed to a people issue. So what I want to do is I want to call upon Republicans and Democrats to forget all the arguing and finger pointing, and come together and take care of our seniors prescription drug program, that says well pay for the poor seniors, well help all seniors with prescription drugs. In the meantime, I think its important to have whats called Immediate Helping Hand, which is direct money to states so that seniors, poor seniors, dont have to choose between food and medicine. Thats part of an overall overhaul. The purchasing powers. And Im against price controls. I think price controls would hurt our ability to continue important research and development. Drug therapies are replacing a lot of medicines as we used to know it. One of the most important things is to continue the research and development component. And so Im against price controls. Expediting drugs through the FDA makes sense, of course. Allowing the new bill that was passed in the Congress made sense to allow for, you know, drugs that were sold overseas to come back and other countries to come back into the United States. That makes sense. But the best thing to do is to reform Medicare.",2000-10-17,Republican
Moderator,"Vice President Gore, two minutes.",2000-10-17,Moderator
Gore,"All right, here we go again. Now look, if you want someone who will spend a lot of words describing a whole convoluted process and then end up supporting legislation that is supported by the big drug companies, this is your man. If you want someone who will fight for you and who will fight for the middle-class families and working men and women, who are sick and tired of having their parents and grandparents pay higher prices for prescription drugs than anybody else, then I want to fight for you. And you asked a great question because its not only seniors. Listen, for 24 years I have never been afraid to take on the big drug companies. They do some great things. They discover great new cures and thats great. We want them to continue that. But they are now spending more money on advertising and promotion. You see all these ads? Than they are on research and development. And they are trying artificially extend the monopoly patent protection so they can keep charging these very high prices. I want to streamline the approval of the competing generic drugs and the new kinds of treatments that can compete with them so we bring the price down for everybody. Now, briefly, let me tell you how my prescription drug plan works. The governor talked about Medicare. I propose a real prescription drug benefit under Medicare for all seniors, all seniors, and heres how it works. You pick your own doctor, and nobody can take that away from you. The doctor chooses the prescription that you need and nobody can overrule your doctor. You go to your own pharmacy and then Medicare pays half the price. If youre poor, they pay all of it. If you have extraordinarily high cost, then they pay all over $4,000 out-of-pocket. And Ill bring new competition to bring the price down. And if you pass the big drug companies bill, nothing will happen.",2000-10-17,Democrat
Moderator,"All right. Another health question, it comes from Vickie French, and its for you, Vice President Gore. Vickie French, where are you? Oh, there she is.",2000-10-17,Moderator
Gore,"I think that we should move step-by-step toward universal health coverage, but I am not in favor of government doing it all. Weve spent 65 years now on the development of a hybrid system, partly private, partly public, and 85% of our people have health insurance, 15% dont. That adds up to 44 million people. That is a national outrage. We have got to get health coverage for those who do not have it and weve got to improve the quality for those who do with a patients bill of rights thats real and that works, the Dingle-Norwood bill, and we have got to fill in the gaps in coverage by finally bringing parity for the treatment of mental illness, because thats been left out. We have got to deal with long-term care. Now, here are the steps that I would take, first of all. I will make a commitment to bring health care coverage of high quality that is affordable to every single child in America within four years. And then well fill other gaps by covering the parents of those children when the family is poor or up to two and a half times the poverty rate. I want to give a tax credit for the purchase of individual health insurance plans. I want to give small business employers a tax credit, 25%, to encourage the providing of health insurance for the employees in small businesses. I want to give seniors who are, well, the near elderly, I dont like that term because I am just about in that category, but those 55 to 65 ought to be able to buy into Medicare for premiums that are reasonable and fair and significantly below what they have to get now. Now, we have a big difference on this. And you need to know the record here. Under Governor Bush, Texas has sunk to be 50th out of 50 in health care  in health insurance for their citizens. Last week he said that they were spending 3.7 billion dollars, or 4.7 billion dollars on this.",2000-10-17,Democrat
Moderator,Mr. Vice president.,2000-10-17,Moderator
Gore,Okay.,2000-10-17,Democrat
Moderator,"Time is up. Governor Bush, two minutes.",2000-10-17,Moderator
Bush,"Im absolutely opposed to a national health care plan. I dont want the federal government making decisions for consumers or for providers. I remember what the administration tried to do in 1993. They tried to have a national health care plan. And fortunately, it failed. I trust people, I dont trust the federal government. Its going to be one of the themes you hear tonight. I dont want the federal government making decisions on behalf of everybody. There is an issue with the uninsured, there sure is. And we have uninsured people in my state. Ours is a big state, a fast-growing state. We share a common border with another nation. But were providing health care for our people. One thing about insurance, thats a Washington term. The question is, are people getting health care, and we have a strong safety net, and there needs to be a safety net in America. There needs to be more community health clinics where the poor can go get health care. We need a program for the uninsured. Theyve been talking about it in Washington, D.C. The number of uninsured has now gone up for the past seven years. We need a $2,000 credit, rebate for people, working people that dont have insurance, they can get in the marketplace and start purchasing insurance. We need to have  allow small businesses to write insurance across jurisdictional lines so small business can afford health care, small restaurants can afford health care. So health care needs to be affordable and available. We have to trust people to make decisions with their lives. In the Medicare reform I talk about it says if you are a senior, you can stay in Medicare if you like it, and thats fine, but were going to give you other choices to choose if you want to do so, just like they do the federal employees. The people that work in Washington, D.C. for the U.S. Congress or the United States senate. Get a variety of choices to make in their lives. And thats what we ought to do for all people in America.",2000-10-17,Republican

Bush,"Well, you know, its hard to make people love one another. I wish I knew the law because I would darn sure sign it. I wish I knew the law that said all of us would be good parents. One of the things the next president must do is to remind people that if we are going to have a responsible period in America, that each of us must love our children with all our heart and all our soul. I happened to believe strong accountability encourages parental involvement, though. I think when you measure and post results on the Internet or in the town newspapers, most parents say wait a minute, my childs school isnt doing what I want it to do and, therefore, become involved in education. I recognize there are some who just dont seem to care. But there are a lot of parents who feel like everything is going well in their childs school, and all of a sudden they wake up and realize that wait a minute, standards arent being met. Thats why Im so strong for accountability. I believe we ought to measure a lot, three, four, five, six, seven, eighth grade. We do so in my state of Texas. One of the good things weve gone in Texas is we have strong accountability because you cant cure unless you know. You cant solve a problem unless you diagnose it. I strongly believe that one of the best things to encourage parental involvement also is to know that the classrooms will be safe and secure. Thats why I support a teacher liability act at the federal level, that says if a teacher or principal upholds reasonable standards of classroom discipline they cant be sued. They cant be sued. I think parents will be more involved with education when they know their childrens classrooms are safe and secure as well. I also believe that we need to say to people that if you cannot meet standards, there has to be a consequence. Instead of just comes the soft bigotry of low expectations, that there has to be a consequence. We cant continue to shuffle children through school. And one of the consequences to allow parents to have different choices.",2000-10-17,Republican
Moderator,Governor. Vice president Gore.,2000-10-17,Moderator
Gore,"We have huge difference between us on this question. Id like to start by telling you what my vision is. I see a day in the United States of America where all of our public schools are considered excellent, world class. Where there are no failing schools, where the classrooms are small enough in size, number of students, so that the teacher can spend enough one-on-one time with each student. Now that means recruiting new teachers for the public schools. It means in my plan hiring bonuses to get 100,000 new teachers in the public schools within the next four years. It means also helping local school districts that sometimes find the parents of school age children outvoted on bond issues, to give them some help with interest-free bonding authority so that we can build new schools and modernize the classrooms. We need to give teachers the training and professional development that they need, including a paid time off to go visit the classroom of a master teacher to pick up some new skills. I want to give every middle-class family a $10,000 a year tax deduction for college tuition so that middle-class families will always be able to send their kids on to college. I want to work for universal free school because we know from all the studies that the youngsters learn, kids learn more in the first few years of life than any where else. Now, I said there was a contrast. Governor Bush is for vouchers, and in his plan he proposes to drain more money, more taxpayer money out of the public schools for private school vouchers than all of the money that he proposes in his entire budget for public schools themselves. And only one in 20 students would be eligible for these vouchers, and they wouldnt even pay the full tuition to private school. I think thats a mistake. I dont think we should give up on the private schools and leave kids trapped in failing schools. I think we  I think we should make it the number one priority to make our schools the best in the world, all of them.",2000-10-17,Democrat
Moderator,"Governor, what is your position on that?",2000-10-17,Moderator
Bush,"Yeah, I appreciate that. I think any time we end with one of these attacks, its appropriate to respond. Heres what I think. First of all, vouchers are up to states. If you want to do a voucher program in Missouri, fine. I strongly believe in local control of schools. Im a governor of state and I dont like it when the federal government tells us what to do. I believe in local control of schools. But heres what I said. Ive said to the extent we spend federal money on disadvantaged children, we want the schools to show us whether or not the children are learning. Whats unreasonable about that? We expect there to be standards met and we expect there to be measurement. And if we find success well praise it. But when we find children trapped in schools that will not change and will not teach, instead of saying oh, this is okay in America just to shuffle poor kids through schools, there has to be a consequence. And the consequence is that federal portion or federal money will go to the parent, so the parent can go to a tutoring program or another public school or another private school. You see, there has to be a consequence. Weve got a society that says hey, the status quo is fine, just move them through. And guess who suffers.",2000-10-17,Republican
Moderator,"Whats the harm on that, whats the other side on that?",2000-10-17,Moderator
Gore,"Well, the program that hes proposing is not the one that he just described. Described under your plan, Governor Bush, states would be required to pay vouchers to students to match the vouchers so that the federal government would put up. Now, youre  and the way it would happen is that under his plan, if a school was designated as failing, the kids would be trapped there for another three years and then some of them would get federal vouchers and the state would be forced to match those, that money. Under my plan, if a school is failing, we work with the states to give them the authority and the resources to close down that school and reopen it right away with a new principal, a new faculty, a turn-around team of specialists who know what theyre doing. Its based on the plan of Governor Jim Hunt in North Carolina, and it works great.",2000-10-17,Democrat
Moderator,So no vouchers under  in a Gore administration?,2000-10-17,Moderator
Gore,"If I thought that there was no alternative, then I might feel differently. But I have an obligation to fight to make sure there are no failing schools. We have to turn around  most schools are excellent, but we have to make sure that all of them are.",2000-10-17,Democrat

Moderator,"Thats a violation of your rule, Vice President Gore.",2000-10-17,Moderator
Gore,"High school. I mentioned before that the local communities are having a harder time passing bond issues. Traditionally, if youve been involved in a campaign like that, you know that the parents with kids in school are the ones that turn out and vote. Its ironic that there are now  there is now a smaller percentage of the voters made up of parents with children than ever in American history because of the aging of our population, but at the same time weve got the largest generation of students in public schools ever. More than 90% of Americas children go to public schools. And its the largest number ever this year and theyll break the record next year and every year for ten years running. Weve got to do something about this. And local  its not enough to leave it up to the local school districts. Theyre not able to do it and our future depends upon it. Look, were in an information age. Our economic future depends upon whether or not our children are going to get the kind of education that lets them go on to college. And again, I want to make it possible for all middle-class families to send their kids to college and more Pell grants for those who are in the lower income groups also, and then I want to make sure that we have job training on top of that and lifelong learning, but it all starts with the public school teachers. My proposal gives $10,000 hiring bonuses for those teachers who are  who get certified to teach in the areas where theyre most needed. Now, accountability, we basically agree on accountability. My plan requires testing of all students. It also requires something that Governor Bushs plan doesnt. It requires testing of all new teachers, including in the subjects that they teach. We have to start treating teachers like the professionals that they are, and give them the respect and the kind of quality of life that will draw more people into teaching because we need a lot more teachers.",2000-10-17,Democrat
Moderator,"Governor Bush, two minutes.",2000-10-17,Moderator
Bush,"When you total up all the federal spending he wants to do, its the largest increase in federal spending in years. And theres just not going to be enough money. I have been a governor of a big state, I have made education my number one priority. Thats what governors ought to do. They ought to say this is the most important thing we do as a state. The federal government puts about 6% of the money up. They put about, you know, 60% of the strings where you have to fill out the paperwork. I dont know if you have to be a paperwork filler-outer, but most of its because of the federal government. What I want to do is to send flexibility and authority to the local folks so you can choose what to do with the money. One size does not fit all. I worry about federalizing education if I were you. I believe strongly that the federal government can help, we need to fund Headstart. We need to have accountability. The Vice Presidents plan does not have annual accountability, third grade, fourth grade, fifth grade. We need to demand on results. I believe strongly in a teacher protection act like I mentioned. I hear from teachers all the time about the lawsuits and the threats, respect in the classroom. Part of its because you cant  you cant control the classroom. You cant have a consequence for somebody without fear of getting sued under federal law. So Im going to ask the Congress to pass a teacher protection act. So I believe in flexibility, I believe in a national reading initiative for local districts to access with K through 2 diagnostic testing, curriculum that works, phonics works, by the way, it needs to be a part of our curriculum. There needs to be flexibility for teacher training and teacher hiring with federal money. The federal government can be a part, but dont fall prey to all this stuff about money here and money there because education is really funded at the local level. 94% comes from the local level.",2000-10-17,Republican
Moderator,"Vice President Gore, is the governor right when he says that youre proposing the largest federal spending in years?",2000-10-17,Moderator
Gore,"Absolutely not. Absolutely not. Im so glad that I have the chance to knock that down. Look, the problem is that under Governor Bushs plan, $1.6 trillion tax cut, mostly to the wealthy, under his own budget numbers, he proposes spending more money for a tax cut just for the wealthiest 1% than all the new money he budgets for education, health care and national defense combined. Now under my plan well balance the budget every year. Im not just saying this. Im not just talking. I have helped to balance the budget for the first time in 30 years, paid down the debt. And under my plan, in four years, as the percentage of our gross domestic product, federal spending will be the smallest that it has been in 50 years. One reason is, you know, the third biggest spending item in our budget is interest on the national debt? We get nothing for it. We keep the good faith and credit of the United States. I will pay down the debt every single year until it is eliminated early in the next decade. That gets rid of the third biggest intrusion of the federal government in our economy. Now, because the governor has all this money for a tax cut mostly to the wealthy, there is no money left over, so schools get testing and lawsuit reform and not much else.",2000-10-17,Democrat

I dont think thats the role of the president to pick youre right and youre not right. I think if youre going to have tax relief, everybody ought to get it. And therefore, wealthy people are going to get it. But the top 1% will end up paying one-third of the taxes in America and they get one-fifth of the benefits. And thats because we structured the plan so that six million additional American families pay no taxes. If youre a family of four making $50,000 in Missouri, you get a 50% cut in your federal income taxes. What Ive done is set priorities and funded them. And theres extra money.

Because the tax code is unfair for people at the bottom end of the economic ladder. If youre a single mother making $22,000 a year today and youre trying to raise two children, for every additional dollar you earn you pay a higher marginal rate on that dollar than someone making $200,000, and thats not right.

And first let me say that our nation now needs to speak with one voice during this time, and I applaud the president for working hard to diffuse tensions. Our nation needs to be credible and strong. When we say were somebodys friend, everybody has got to believe it. Israel is our friend and well stand by Israel. We need to reach out to moderate Arab nations as well to build coalitions to keep the peace. I also need  the next leader needs to be patient. We cant put the Middle East peace process on our timetable. Its got to be on the timetable of the people that were trying to bring to the peace table. We cant dictate the terms of peace, which means that you have to be steady. You cant worry about polls or focus groups. Youve got to have a clear vision. Thats what a leader does. A leader also understands that the United States must be strong to keep the peace. Saddam Hussein still is a threat in the Middle East. Our coalition against Saddam is unraveling. Sanctions are loosened. The man who may be developing weapons of mass destruction, we dont know because inspectors arent in.

Gore,"I see a future when the world is at peace, with the United States of America promoting the values of democracy and human rights and freedom all around the world. Even in Iran they have had an election that began to bring about some change. We stand for those values and we have to be willing to assert them. Right now our military is the strongest in the entire history of the world. I will  I pledge to you I will do whatever is necessary to make sure that it stays that way. Now, what can I bring to that challenge? When I was a young man, my father was a senator opposed to the Vietnam War. When I graduated from college, there were plenty of fancy ways to get out of going and being a part of that. I went and I volunteered, and I went to Vietnam. I didnt do the most or run the greatest risk by a long shot, but I learned what it was like to be an enlisted man in the United States Army. In the Congress, in the House of Representatives, I served on the House Intelligence Committee and I worked hard to learn the subject of nuclear arms control and how we can diffuse these tensions and deal with non-proliferation and deal with the problems of terrorism and these new weapons of mass destruction. Look, were gonna face some serious new challenges in the next four years. Ive worked on that long and hard. When I went to the United States Senate, I asked for an assignment to the Armed Services Committee. And while I was there I worked on a bipartisan basis, as I did in the House, I worked with former President Reagan on the modernization of our strategic weaponry. In the Senate I was one of only ten Democrats, along with Senator Joe Lieberman, to support Governor Bushs dad in the Persian Gulf War Resolution.

Last week I broke up  I suspended campaigning for two days, or parts of two days, to go back and participate in the meetings that charted the Presidents summit meeting that he just returned from earlier today. And our team of  our countrys team over there did a great job. Its a difficult situation. The United States has to be strong in order to make sure that we can help promote peace and security and stability. And that means keeping our military strong. Now, I said earlier that we are the strongest military, but we need to continue improving readiness and making sure that our military personnel are adequately paid and that the combination of their pay and their benefits and their retirement as veterans is comparable to the stiff competition thats coming in this strong economy from the private sector. And I have supported the largest pay raise in many a year, and I support another one now. I also support modernization of our strategic and tactical weaponry. The governor has proposed skipping a generation of technology. I think that would be a mistake, because I think one of the ways weve been able to be so successful in Kosovo and Bosnia and Haiti and in other places is by having the technological edge. You know, we won that conflict in Kosovo without losing a single human life in combat, a single American life in combat. Now, readiness. The trends before we  before I got my current job were on the decline, the number of divisions were reduced. I argued that we should reverse that trend and take it back up. And Im happy to tell you that we have. Now, in my budget for the next ten years I propose $100 billion for this purpose. The governor proposes $45 billion.

It must be in the national interests, must be in our vital interests whether we ever send troops. The mission must be clear. Soldiers must understand why were going. The force must be strong enough so that the mission can be accomplished. And the exit strategy needs to be well-defined. Im concerned that were overdeployed around the world. See, I think the mission has somewhat become fuzzy. Should I be fortunate enough to earn your confidence, the mission of the United States military will be to be prepared and ready to fight and win war. And therefore prevent war from happening in the first place. There may be some moments when we use our troops as peacekeepers, but not often. The Vice President mentioned my view of long-term for the military. I want to make sure the equipment for our military is the best it can possibly be, of course. But we have an opportunity  we have an opportunity to use our research and development capacities, the great technology of the United States, to make our military lighter, harder to find, more lethal. We have an opportunity, really, if you think about it, if were smart and have got a strategic vision and a leader who understands strategic planning, to make sure that we change the terms of the battlefield of the future so we can keep the peace. This is a peaceful nation, and I intend to keep the peace. Spending money is one thing. But spending money without a strategic plan can oftentimes be wasted. First thing Im going to do is ask the Secretary of Defense to develop a plan so we are making sure were not spending our money on political projects, but on projects to make sure our soldiers are well-paid, well-housed, and have the best equipment in the world.",2000-10-17,Republican

Here is what I believe, sir. I believe law-abiding citizens ought to be allowed to protect themselves and their families. I believe that we ought to keep guns out of the hands of people that shouldnt have them. Thats why Im for instant background checks at gun shows, Im for trigger locks, I think that makes sense. Matter of fact, we distributed free trigger locks in the State of Texas so that people can get them and put them on their guns to make their guns more safe. I think we ought to raise the age at which juveniles can have a gun. But I also believe strongly that we need to enforce laws on the books that the best way to make sure that we keep our society safe and secure is to hold people accountable for breaking the law. If we catch somebody illegally selling a gun, there needs to be a consequence. If we keep somebody  you know, illegally using a gun, there needs to be a consequence. Enforcement of law, and the federal government can help. There is a great program called Project Exile in Richmond, Virginia, where we focused federal taxpayers money and federal prosecutors and went after people who were illegally using guns. To me thats how you make society the safest it can be. And so, yeah, sometimes I agree with some of these groups in Washington and sometimes I dont. Im a pretty independent thinker.

I think that some common sense gun safety measures are certainly needed with the flood of cheap handguns that have sometimes been working their way into the hands of the wrong people. But all of my proposals are focused on that problem, gun safety. None of my proposals would have any effect on hunters, or sportsmen, or people who use rifles. Theyre aimed at the real problem. Lets make our schools safe, lets make our neighborhoods safe. Lets have a three-day waiting period, cooling off, so we can have a background check to make sure that criminals and people who really shouldnt have guns dont get them. But I would like to use my remaining time on this exchange, Jim, to respond to an exchange that took place just a moment ago. Because a couple of times the governor has said that I am for a bigger government. Governor, Im not. And let me tell you what the record shows. For the last eight years I have had the challenge of running the streamlining program called Reinventing Government. And if there are any federal employees in this group, you know what that means. The federal government has been reduced in size by more than 300,000 people. And its now the smallest number that we have had since the  the smallest in size since John Kennedys administration. During the last five years, Texass government has gone up in size. Federal government has gone down, Texass government has gone up. Now, my plan for the future, I see a time when we have smaller, smarter government where you dont have to wait in line because you can get services online cheaper, better, faster.

In the last several years, the so-called Freedom To Farm Law has, in my view, been mostly a failure. I want to change many of its provisions. Now, many here who are not involved in farming dont  wont follow this, so just forgive me. Because the 2% of the country that is involved in farming is important because the rest of us wouldnt eat except for them. And you guys have been having a hard time, and I want to fight for you. I want to change those provisions. I want to restore a meaningful safety net. And I think that you pointed the way in your comments, because when you say there are multiple things accomplished by farmers, youre specifically including conservation and protection of the environment. And yes, farmers are the first environmentalists. And when they decide not to plow a field that is vulnerable to soil erosion, that may cost them a little money, but it helps the environment. I think that we ought to have an expanded conservation reserve program. And I think that the environmental benefits that come from sound management of the land ought to represent a new way for farmers to get some income that will enable them  enable you to make sensible choices in crop rotation, and when you leave the land fallow and the rest. Now, Ill go beyond that and say I think we need much more focus on rural economic development programs. I see a time when the Internet-based activities are more available in the rural areas and where the extra source of income that farm families used to have from shoe factories is replaced by an extra source of income from working in the information economy.

Were the best and the most efficient farmers. I dont want to use food as a diplomatic weapon from this point forward. We shouldnt be using food. It hurts the farmers. Its not the right thing to do. Im for value-added processing. We need more work on value-added processing. You take the raw product you produce, I presume youre a farmer, off your farm, and you convert it. Value-added processing is important. Im for research and development. Spending research and development money so that we can use our technological base to figure out new uses for farm products. Im for getting rid of the death tax, completely getting rid of the death tax. One reason family farmers are forced to sell early is because of the death tax. This is a bad tax. The President shouldnt have vetoed that bill. Its a tax that taxes people twice. It penalizes the family farmer. So should I be fortunate enough to earn your vote, I also understand  I want to open up markets, but I also understand that farming is a part of our national security. Im from a big farm state. Were the second biggest state  farming state in the country. And I hear from my farmers and friends all the time. The Vice President is right, by the way. Every day is earth day if you own the land.

And the vast majority of all family businesses would be completely exempt, and all of the others would have sharply reduced. So 80%  now the problem with completely eliminating it goes back to the wealthiest 1%. The amount of money that has to be raised in taxes for middle-class families to make up for completely eliminating that on the very wealthiest, the billionaires, that would be an extra heavy burden on middle-class families.

Secondly, I think your plan  a lot of fine print in your plan, Mr. Vice President, with all due respect. It is  Im not so sure 80% of the people get the death tax.

Parents are teaching their children right from wrong, and the message oftentimes gets undermined by the popular culture. You bet theres things that government can do. We can work with the entertainment industry to provide family hour. We can have filters on Internets where public money is spent. There ought to be filters in public libraries and filters in public schools so if kids get on the Internet, there is not going to be pornography or violence coming in. I think we ought to have character education in our schools. I know that doesnt directly talk about Hollywood, but it does reinforce the values youre teaching. Greatly expand character education funding so that public schools will teach children values, values which have stood the test of time. Theres afterschool money available. I think that afterschool money ought to be available for faith-based programs and charitable programs that exist because somebody has heard the call to love a neighbor like you would like to be loved yourself. That will help reinforce the values that parents teach at home as well. Ours is a great land, and one of the reasons why is because were free. And so I dont support censorship. But I do believe that we ought to talk plainly to the Hollywood moguls and people who produce this stuff and explain the consequences. I think we need to have rating systems that are clear. I happen to like the idea of having technology for the TV, easy for parents to use so you can tune out these programs you dont want in your house.

She and her husband made us grandparents almost a year-and-a-half ago, and yet if shell forgive me, when she was little, she brought a record home that had some awful lyrics in it and Tipper hit the ceiling. And that launched a campaign to try to get the record companies to put ratings that  warning labels for parents. And Im so proud of what she accomplished in getting them on there. Ive been involved myself in negotiating and helping to move along the negotiations with the Internet service providers to get a parents protection page every time 95% of the pages come up. And a feature that allows parents to automatically check with one click what sites your kids have visited lately. You know, some parents are worried about those filters, that you will have to ask your kids how to put them on there. But if you can check up on them, thats real power. And recently the Federal Trade Commission pointed out that some of these entertainment companies have warned parents that the material is inappropriate for children, and then theyve turned around behind the backs of the parents and advertised that same adult material directly to children. That is an outrage. Joe Lieberman and I gave them six months to clean up their act.

Sometimes people who are very idealistic and have great dreams, as young people do, are apt to stay at arms length from the political process because they think their good hearts might be brittle, and if they invest their hopes and allow themselves to believe, then theyre gonna be let down and disappointed.

The HMOs are against the patients rights bill, the Dingle-Norwood bill that I support, and that Gov. Bush does not support. The big oil companies are against the measures to get more energy independence and renewable fuel.

I dont think its the issues that turn kids off. I think its the tone. I think its the attitude. I think its a cynicism in Washington and it doesnt have to be that way.

I dont like quotas. Quotas tend to pit one group of people against another. Quotas are bad for America. Its not the way America is all about. But policies that give people a helping hand so they can help themselves. For example, in our State of Texas I worked with the legislature, both Republicans and Democrats, to pass a law that said if you come in the top 10% of your high school class, youre automatically admitted to one of our higher institutions of learning, college. And as a result, our universities are now more diverse. It was a smart thing to do. What I called it, I labeled it affirmative access. I think the contracting business in government can help. Not with quotas, but help meet a goal of ownership of small businesses, for example. The contracts need to be smaller, the agencies need to be  need to recruit and to work hard to find people to bid on the state contracts. I think we can do that in a way that represents what America is all about, which is equal opportunity and an opportunity for people to realize their potential.

Its all too easy for somebody in the majority in the population to say oh, were just all the same, without an understanding of the different life experience that youve had, that others have had. Once you have that understanding and mutual respect, then we can transcend the differences and embrace the highest common denominator of the American spirit.

I know what a hate crime statute pending at the national level is all about in the aftermath of James Byrds death. Im for that proposed law, the governor is against it.

This is, with all due respect, Governor, thats a red herring. Affirmative action isnt quotas. Im against quotas, theyre illegal. Theyre against the American way.

And if you have a  if you have an elderly parent or grandparent who needs long-term care, then you will get help with that. $3,000 tax credit to help your expenses in taking care of a loved one who needs long-term care.",2000-10-17,Democrat
Moderator,Governor Bush?,2000-10-17,Moderator
Bush,"Let me just say the first  this business about the entitlement he tried to describe about savings, you know, matching savings here and matching savings there, fully-funded its gonna cost a whole lot of money, a lot more than we have. Youre going to get a tax relief in my plan. Youre not going to be targeted in or targeted out. Everybody that pays taxes is going to get tax relief. If you take care of an elderly in your home, youre going to get the personal exemption increased. I think also what you need to think about is not the immediate, but what about Medicare? You get a plan that will include prescription drugs, a plan that will give you options. Now, I hope people understand that Medicare today is important, but it doesnt keep up with the new medicines. If youre a Medicare person, on Medicare, you dont get the new procedures. Youre stuck in a time warp in many ways. So it will be a modern Medicare system that trusts you to make a variety of options for you. Youre going to live in a peaceful world. It will be a world of peace because were going to have a clear sight of foreign policy based upon a strong military and a mission that stands by our friends. A mission that doesnt try to be all things to all people. A judicious use of the military which will help keep the peace. Youll live in a world, hopefully, that is more educated so its less likely youll be harmed in your neighborhood. See, an educated child is one much more likely to be hopeful and optimistic. Youll be in a world in which fits into my philosophy. The harder you work, the more you can keep. Its the American way. Government shouldnt be a heavy hand. Its what the federal government does to you. It should be a helping hand, and tax relief and the proposals I just described should be a good helping hand.",2000-10-17,Republican
Moderator,"Governor, next question is for you, and Leo Anderson will ask it. Mr. Anderson. You want a mike?",2000-10-17,Moderator
Bush,"No, Im not proud of that. The death penalty is a very serious business, Leo. Its an issue that good people obviously disagree on. I take my job seriously. And if you think I was proud of it, I think you misread me, I do. I was sworn to uphold the laws of my state. During the course of the campaign in 1994 I was asked do you support the death penalty. I said I did if administered fairly and justly. Because I believe it saves lives, Leo, I do. If its administered swiftly, justly and fairly, it saves lives. One of the things that happens when youre a governor, at least oftentimes you have to make tough decisions. You cant let public persuasion sway you, because the job is to enforce the law. And thats what I did, sir. There have been some tough cases come across my desk. Some of the hardest moments since Ive been the governor of the State of Texas is to deal with those cases. But my job is to ask two questions, sir. Is the person guilty of the crime? And did the person have full access to the courts of law? And I can tell you looking at you right now, in all cases those answers were affirmative. Im not proud of any record. Im proud of the fact that violent crime is down in the State of Texas. Im proud of the fact that we hold people accountable. But Im not proud of any record, sir, Im not.",2000-10-17,Republican

Gore,"I support the death penalty. I think that it has to be administered not only fairly with attention to things like DNA evidence, which I think should be used in all capital cases, but also with very careful attention. If, for example, somebody confesses to the crime and somebody is waiting on death row, there has to be alertness to say wait a minute, have we got the wrong guy? If the wrong guy is put to death, then thats a double tragedy. Not only has an innocent person been executed, but the real perpetrator of the crime has not been held accountable for it. And in some cases may be still at large. But I support the death penalty in the most heinous cases.",2000-10-17,Democrat

Gore,"Yes. (LAUGHTER) I am a person who keeps promises. And, you know, weve heard a lot about  from the governor about not much being done in the last eight years, as if the promises that I made eight years ago have not been kept. I think the record shows otherwise. We have gone from the biggest deficits eight years ago to the biggest surpluses in history today. Instead of high unemployment, we now have the lowest African-American unemployment, the lowest Latino unemployment ever measured. 22 million new jobs, very low unemployment nationally. Instead of ballooning the debt and multiplying it four times over, we have seen the debt actually begun to be paid down. Here are some promises that Ill make to you now. I will balance the budget every year. I will pay down the debt every year. I will give middle-class Americans tax cuts, meaningful ones. And I will invest in education, health care, protecting the environment and retirement security. We both made promises in this campaign. I promise you I will keep mine. Let me tell you about one of the governors. He has promised a trillion dollars out of the Social Security Trust Fund for young working adults to invest and save on their own. But hes promised seniors that their Social Security benefits will not be cut, and hes promised the same trillion dollars to them. So this is a show me state. Reminds me of the line from the movie, Show me the money. Which one of those promises will you keep and which will you break, Governor?",2000-10-17,Democrat
Moderator,Governor Bush.,2000-10-17,Moderator
Bush,"Thank you for your question. (LAUGHTER) I  theres an old high school debating trick, which is to answer something and then attack your opponent at the end. You asked about promises. You were promised that Medicare would be reformed, and that Social Security would be reformed. You were promised a middle-class tax cut in 1992. It didnt happen. Theres too much bitterness in Washington. Theres too much wrangling. Its time to have a fresh start. One of the reasons I was successful as the governor of Texas is because I didnt try to be all things to all people. When I campaigned in a race, a lot of folks didnt think I could win including, by the way, my mother. (LAUGHTER) I said Id do four things; tort reform, education reform, welfare reform and juvenile justice reform. And I won. And I had the will of the people in my state behind me. And then I brought folks together to get it done. And thats what we need, I think, in this election. To me thats what its all about. Im sure your 6th grade kids are listening and saying, these guys will say anything to get elected. But theres a record, and thats what I hope people look at. One of my promises is going to be Social Security reform, and you bet, we need to take a trillion dollars out of that $2.4 trillion surplus. Now remember, Social Security revenue exceeds expenses up until 2015. People are going to get paid. But if youre a younger worker, if youre younger, you better hope this country thinks differently, otherwise youre gonna be faced with huge payroll taxes or reduced benefits. And you bet were gonna take a trillion dollars of your own money and let you invest it under safe guidelines so you get a better rate of return on the money than the paltry 2% that the federal government gets for you today. Thats one of my promises. But its gonna require people to bring both Republicans and Democrats together to get it done. Thats what it requires. There was a chance to get this done. It was a bipartisan approach, but its been rejected. Im going to bring them together.",2000-10-17,Republican
Moderator,"Both of you  both of you on this subject. There are other questions that also go to this skepticism, not necessarily about you, but all people in politics. Why is that?",2000-10-17,Moderator
Gore,"Well, first of all, Jim, I would like to respond to what the governor just said. Because the trillion dollars that has been promised to young people has also been promised to older people. And you cannot keep both promises. If youre in your mid-40s under the governors plan, Social Security will be bankrupt by the time you retire, if he takes it out of the Social Security Trust Fund. Under my plan it will be  its solvency will be extended until youre 100. Now that is the difference. And the governor may not want to answer that question, he may want to call it a high school debating trick, but let me tell you this. This election is not about debating tricks, it is about your future. The reason Social Security  he says it gets 2%. You know, its not a bank account that just pays back money thats invested. It is also used to give your mothers and fathers the Social Security checks that they live on. If you take a trillion dollars out of that Social Security Trust Fund, how are the checks going to be  how are you going to keep faith with the seniors? Now let me come directly to your question.",2000-10-17,Democrat

Gore,"Thank you very much, Jim, and Ill begin by answering your questions  your last question. I believe that a lot of people are skeptical about people in politics today because we have seen a time of great challenge for our country. Since the assassination of our best leaders in the 60s, since the Vietnam War, since Watergate, and because we need campaign finance reform. I would like to tell you something about me. I keep my word. I have kept the faith. Ive kept the faith with my country. I volunteered for the Army. I served in Vietnam. I kept the faith with my family. Tipper and I have been married for 30 years. We have devoted ourselves to our children and now our nearly one-and-a-half-year-old grandson. I have kept the faith with our country. Nine times I have raised my hand to take an oath to the Constitution, and I have never violated that oath. I have not spent the last quarter century in pursuit of personal wealth. I have spent the last quarter century fighting for middle-class working men and women in the United States of America. I believe very deeply that you have to be willing to stand up and fight no matter what powerful forces might be on the other side. If you want somebody who is willing to fight for you, I am asking for your support and your vote and, yes, your confidence and your willingness to believe that we can do the right thing in America, and be the better for it. Weve made some progress during the last eight years. We have seen the strongest economy in the history of the United States. Lower crime rates for eight years in a row. Highest private home ownership ever, but Ill make you one promise here. You aint seen nothing yet. And I will keep that promise.",2000-10-17,Democrat

Bush,"Well, Jim, I want to thank you and thank the folks here at Washington University and the vice president. Appreciate the chance to have a good, honest dialogue about our differences of opinion. I think after three debates the good people of this country understand there is a difference of opinion. There is a difference between big federal government and somebody who is coming from outside of Washington who will trust individuals. Ive got an agenda that I want to get done for the country. Its an agenda that says were going to reform Medicare to make sure seniors have got prescription drugs and to give seniors different options from which they can choose. Its an agenda that says were listen to the young voices in Social Security and say were going to think differently about making sure we have a system, but also fulfill the promise to the seniors in America. A promise made will be a promise kept should I be fortunate enough to become your president. I want to have the military keeping the peace. I want to make sure the public school system in America keeps its promise so not one child is left behind. After setting priorities, I want to give some of your money back. I dont think the surplus is the governments money. I think its the peoples money. I dont think the surplus exists because of the ingenuity and hard work of the federal government, I think it exists because of the ingenuity and hard work of the American people. And you ought to have some of this surplus so you can save and dream and build. I look forward to the final weeks of this campaign. Im asking for your vote. For those of you for me, thanks for your help. For those of you for my opponent, please only vote once. (LAUGHTER) But for those who have not made up their mind, I would like to conclude by this promise. Should I be fortunate enough to become your president, when I put my hand on the Bible, I will swear to not only uphold the laws of the land, but I will also swear to uphold the honor and the dignity of the office to which I have been elected, so help me God.

Audience Question,"Well, yeah, uh-huh.",1992-10-15,Moderator
Clinton,"Well, Ive been governor of a small state for 12 years. Ill tell you how its affected me. Every year Congress and the president sign laws that make us do more things and gives us less money to do it with. I see people in my state, middle class people  their taxes have gone up in Washington and their services have gone down while the wealthy have gotten tax cuts. I have seen whats happened in this last 4 years when  in my state, when people lose their jobs theres a good chance Ill know them by their names. When a factory closes, I know the people who ran it. When the businesses go bankrupt, I know them. And Ive been out here for 13 months meeting in meetings just like this ever since October, with people like you all over America, people that have lost their jobs, lost their livelihood, lost their health insurance. What I want you to understand is the national debt is not the only cause of that. It is because America has not invested in its people. It is because we have not grown. It is because weve had 12 years of trickle down economics. Weve gone from first to twelfth in the world in wages. Weve had 4 years where weve produced no private sector jobs. Most people are working harder for less money than they were making ten years ago. It is because we are in the grip of a failed economic theory. And this decision youre about to make better be about what kind of economic theory you want, not just people saying Im going to go fix it but what are we going to do? I think we have to do is invest in American jobs, American education, control American health care costs and bring the American people together again.",1992-10-15,Democrat

Audience Question,"Yes, I do. My name is Ben Smith. I work in the financial field, counseling retirees, and Im personally concerned about three major areas. One is the Social Security Administration or trust fund is projected to be insolvent by the year 2036. And we funded the trust fund with IOUs in the form of Treasury bonds. The Pension Guarantee Fund, which backs up our private retirement plans for retirees, is projected to be bankrupt by the year 2026, not to mention the cutbacks by private companies. And Medicare is projected to be bankrupt maybe as soon as 1997. And I would like from each of you a specific response as to what you intend to do for retirees relative to these issues, not generalities but specifics because I think theyre very disturbing issues.",1992-10-15,Moderator
Simpson,"President Bush, may we start with you?",1992-10-15,Moderator
Bush,"Well, the Social Security  youre an expert and I could, Im sure, learn from you the details of the Pension Guarantee Fund and the Social Security Fund. The Social Security system was fixed about 5 years, and I think its projected out to be sound beyond that. So at least we have time to work with it. But on all of these things, a sound economy is the only way to get it going. Growth in the economy is gonna add to the overall prosperity and wealth. I cant give you a specific answer on Pension Guarantee Fund. All I know is that we have firm government credit to guarantee the pensions. And that is very important. But its  the full faith and credit of the US, in spite of our difficulties, is still pretty good. Its still the most respected credit. So I would simply say, as these dates get close, youre going to have to reorganize and refix as we did with the Social Security Fund. And I think thats the only answer. But the more immediate answer is to do what this lady was suggesting we do, and that is to get this deficit down and get on without adding to the woes, and then restructure. One thing Ive called for that has been stymied, and Ill keep on working for it, is a whole financial reform legislation. It is absolutely essential in terms of bringing our banking system and credit system into the new age instead of having it living back in the dark ages. And its a big fight. And I dont want to give my friend Ross another shot at me here but I am fighting with the Congress to get this through. And you cant just go up and say Im going to fix it. Youve got some pretty strong-willed guys up there that argue with you. But thats what the elections about. I agree with the governor. Thats what the elections about. And sound fiscal policy is the best answer, I think, to all the three problems you mentioned.",1992-10-15,Republican
Simpson,Thank you. Mr. Perot.,1992-10-15,Moderator
Perot,"On the broad issue here, when youre trying to solve a problem, you get the best plans. You have a raging debate about those plans. Then out of that debate, with leadership, comes consensus. Then, if the plans are huge and complex like health care, I would urge you to implement pilot programs. Like the old carpenter says measure twice, cut once. Lets make sure this things as good as we all think it is at the end of the meeting. Then finally, our government passes laws and freezes the plan in concrete. Anybody thats ever built a successful business will tell you you optimize, optimize, optimize after youve put something into effect. The reason Medicare and Medicaid are a mess is we froze them. Everybody knows how to fix them. There are people all over the federal government, if they could just touch it with a screwdriver, could fix it. Now, back over here. See, weve got a $4 trillion debt and only in America would you have $2.8 trillion of it or 70% of it financed 5 years or less. Now, thats another thing for you to think about when you go home tonight. You dont finance long-term debt with short-term money. Why did our government do it? To get the interest rates down. A 1% increase in interest rates in that $2.8 trillion is $28 billion a year. Now, when you look at what Germany pays for money and what we dont pay for money, you realize theres quite a spread, right, and you realize this is a temporary thing and theres going to be another sucking sound that runs our deficit through the roof. You know, and everybodys ducking it so Im gonna say it, that we are not letting that surplus stay in the bank. We are not investing that surplus like a pension fund. We are spending that surplus to make the deficit look smaller to you than it really is. Now, that  put you in jail in corporate America if you kept books that way but in government its just kind of the way things are. Thats because it comes at you, not from you. Now then, that money needs to be  they dont even pay interest on it. They just write a note for the interest.",1992-10-15,Independent

If were $4 trillion down, we should have everything perfect, but we dont. Weve got to pay it off and build money to renew it- -spend money to renew it, and thats going to take a growing, expanding job base. That is priority one in this country.

Clinton,"I think I remember the question. (Laughter.) Let me say first of all, I want to answer your specific question but first of all, we all agree that there should be a growing economy. What you have to decide is whos got the best economic plan. And we all have ideas out there, and Mr. Bush has a record. So I dont want you to read my lips and I sure dont want you to read his. I do hope you will read our plans. Now, specifically, one, on Medicare, it is not true that everyone knows how to fix it. There are different ideas  the Bush plan, the Perot plan, the Clinton  we have different ideas. I am convinced, having studied health care for a year hard and talking to hundreds and hundreds of people all across America, that you cannot control the cost of Medicare until you control the cost of private health care and public health care, with managed competition, ceiling on cost, and radical reorganization of the insurance markets. Youve got to do that; we got to get those costs down. Number 2, with regard to Social Security, that program  a lot of you may not know this  it produces a $70 billion surplus a year. Social Security is in surplus $70 billion. Six increases in the payroll tax  that means people with incomes of $51,000 a year or less pay a disproportionally high share of the federal tax burden, which is why I want some middle-class tax relief. What do we have to do? By the time the century turns, we have got to have our deficit under control, we have to work out of so that surplus is building up so when the baby boomers like me retire, were okay. Number 3, on the pension funds, I dont know as much about it, but I will say this. What I would do is to bring in the pension experts of the country, take a look at it, and strengthen the pension requirements further, because its not just enough to have the guarantee. We had a guarantee on the S&Ls, right? We had a guarantee  and what happened? You picked up a $500-billion bill because of the dumb way the federal government deregulated it. So I think we are going to have to change and strengthen the pension requirements on private retirement plans.",1992-10-15,Democrat

Simpson,Mr. President.,1992-10-15,Moderator
Bush,"Well, we have come to that position. Since I became president, 43, 44 countries have gone democratic, no longer totalitarian, no longer living under dictatorship or communist rule. This is exciting. New world order to me means freedom and democracy. I think we will have a continuing responsibility, as the only remaining superpower, to stay involved. If we pull back in some isolation and say we dont have to do our share, or more than our share, anymore, I believe you are going to just ask for conflagration that well get involved in the future. NATO, for example, has kept the peace for many, many years, and I want to see us keep fully staffed in NATO so well continue to guarantee the peace in Europe. But the exciting thing is, the fear of nuclear war is down. And you hear all the bad stuff thats happened on my watch; I hope people will recognize that this is something pretty good for mankind. I hope theyll think its good that democracy and freedom is on the move. And were going to stay engaged, as long as Im president, working to improve things. You know, its so easy now to say, hey, cut out foreign aid, we got a problem at home. I think the US has to still have the Statue of Liberty as a symbol, caring for others. Right this very minute were sending supplies in to help these little starving kids in Somalia. Its the US thats taken the lead in humanitarian aid into Bosnia. Were doing this all around the world. Yes, we got problems at home. And I think I got a good plan to help fix those problems at home. But because of our leadership, because we didnt listen to the freeze  the nuclear-freeze group, do you remember  freeze it, back in the late 70s  freeze, dont touch it; were going to lock it in now or else well have war. President Reagan said no, peace through strength. It worked. The Soviet Union is no more, and now were working to help them become totally democratic through the Freedom Support Act that I led on, a great Democratic ambassador, Bob Strauss, over there, Jim Baker, all of us got this thing passed  through cooperation, Ross  it worked with cooperation, and youre for that, Im sure, helping Russia become democratic. So the new world order to me means freedom and democracy, keep engaged, do not pull back into isolation. And we are the US, and we have a responsibility to lead and to guarantee the security. If it hadnt been for us, Saddam Hussein would be sitting on top of three-fifths of the oil supply of the world and hed have nuclear weapons. And only the US could do this. Excuse me, Carole.",1992-10-15,Republican
Simpson,Thank you. Mr. Perot.,1992-10-15,Moderator
Perot,"Well, its cost-effective to help Russia succeed in its revolution; its pennies on the dollar compared to going back to the Cold War. Russia is still very unstable; they could go back to square one, and worse. All the nuclear weapons are not dismantled. I am particularly concerned about the intercontinental weapons, the ones that can hit us. Weve got agreements, but they are still there. With all this instability and breaking into republics, and all the Middle Eastern countries going over there and shopping for weapons, weve got our work cut out for us. So we need to stay right on top of that and constructively help them move toward democracy and capitalism. We have to have money to do that. We have to have our people at work. See, for 45 years we were preoccupied with the Red Army. I suggest now that our number one preoccupation is red ink and our country and weve got to put our people back to work so that we can afford to do these things we want to do in Russia. We cannot be the policeman for the world any longer. We spent $300 billion a year defending the world. Germany and Japan spend around $30 billion a piece. If I can get you to defend me and I can spend all my money building industry thats a home run for me. Coming out of World War II it made sense. Now, the other superpowers need to do their part. Ill close on this point. You cant be a superpower unless youre an economic superpower. If were not an economic superpower, were a used to be and we will no longer be a force for good throughout the world. And if nothing else gets you excited about rebuilding our industrial base maybe that will because job one is to put our people back to work.",1992-10-15,Independent
Simpson,"Governor Clinton, the president mentioned Saddam Hussein. Your vice president and you have had some words about the president and Saddam Hussein. Would you care to comment?",1992-10-15,Moderator
Clinton,"Id rather answer her question first and then Ill be glad to. Because the question you ask is important. The end of the Cold War brings an incredible opportunity for change. Winds of freedom blowing around the world, Russia demilitarizing. And it also requires us to maintain some continuity  some bipartisan American commitment to certain principles. And I would just say there are three things that I would like to say  number one  we do have to maintain the worlds strongest defense. We may differ about what the elements of that are. I think that defense needs to be  with fewer people in permanent armed services but with greater mobility on the land, in the air and on the sea, with a real dedication to continuing development of high technology weaponry and well trained people. I think were going to have to work to stop the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Got to keep going until all those nuclear weapons in Russia are gone and the other republics. Number 2, if you dont rebuild the economic strength of this country at home, we wont be a superpower. We cant have any more instances like what happened when Mr. Bush went to Japan and the Japanese prime minister said he felt sympathy for our country. We have to be the strongest economic power in the world. Thats what got me into this race, so we could rebuild the American economy. And number three, we need to be a force for freedom and democracy and we need to use our unique position to support freedom, whether its in Haiti or in China or in any other place, wherever the seeds of freedom are sprouting. We cant impose it, but we need to nourish it and thats the kind of thing that I would do as president  follow those three commitments into the future.",1992-10-15,Democrat

Perot,"Go ahead, sir. Yeah, go ahead.",1992-10-15,Independent
Bush,"Id be delighted to, because you cant do it the old way. You cant do it with the school bureaucracy controlling everything and thats why we have a new program that I hope people have heard about. Its being worked now in 1700 communities  bypassed Congress on this one, Ross  1700 communities across the country. Its called America 2000. And it literally says to the communities, re-invent the schools, not just the bricks and mortar but the curriculum and everything else. Think anew. We have a concept called the New American School Corporation where were doing exactly that. And so I believe that weve got to get the power in the hands of the teachers, not the teachers union. Whats happening up there? (Laughter) And so our America 2000 program also says this. It says lets give parents the choice of a public, private or public school  public, private or religious school. And it works- -it works in Milwaukee. Democratic woman up there  taking the lead in this. The mayor up there, on the program. And the schools that are not chosen are improved  competition does that. So weve got to innovate through school choice. Weve got to innovate through this America 2000 program. But she is absolutely right. The programs that weve been trying where you control everything and mandate it from Washington dont work. The governors  and I believe Governor Clinton was in on this  but maybe  I dont want to invoke him here. But they come to me and they say, please get the Congress to stop passing so many mandates telling us how to control things. We know better how to do it in California or Texas or wherever it is. So this is what our program is all about. And I believe youre right on to something, that if we dont change the education were not going to be able to compete. Federal funding for education is up substantially  Pell grants are up. But it isnt going to get the job done if we dont change K through 12.",1992-10-15,Republican
Simpson,Governor Clinton.,1992-10-15,Moderator
Clinton,"First of all, let me say that Ive spent more of my time and life on this in the last 12 years than any other issue. Seventy percent of my states money goes to the public schools, and I was really honored when Time magazine said that our schools have shown more improvement than any other state in the country except one other  they named 2 states showing real strides forward in the 80s. So I care a lot about this, and Ive spent countless hours in schools. But let me start with what you said. I agree with some of what Mr. Bush said, but its nowhere near enough. We live in a world where what you earn depends on what you can learn, where the average 18- year-old will change jobs 8 times in a lifetime and where none of us can promise any of you that what you now do for a living is absolutely safe from now on. Nobody running can promise that, theres too much change in the world. So what should we do? Let me reel some things off real quick, because you said you wanted specifics. Number one, under my program we would provide matching funds to states to teach everybody with a job to read in the next 5 years and give everybody with a job the chance to get a high school diploma, in big places on the job. Number 2, we would provide 2-year apprenticeship programs to high school graduates who dont go to college. And community colleges are on the job. Number three, wed open the doors to college education to high school graduates without regard to income. They could borrow the money and pay it back as a percentage of their income or with a couple of years of service to our nation here at home. Number 4, we would fully fund the Head Start program to get little kids off to a good start. And, 5, I would have an aggressive program of school reform, more choices  I favor public schools or these new charter schools  we can talk about that if you want. I dont think we should spend tax money on private schools. But I favor public school choice, and I favor radical decentralization in giving more power to better-trained principals and teachers with parent councils to control their schools. Those things would revolutionize American education and take us to the top economically.",1992-10-15,Democrat

Audience Question,What are they going to cost?,1992-10-15,Moderator
Simpson,"The question is, what is it going to cost? What is it going to cost?",1992-10-15,Moderator
Clinton,"In 6 years  I budget all this in my budget, and in 6 years the college program would cost 8 billion dollars over and above what  the present student loan program costs 4; you pay 3 billion dollars for busted loans, because we dont have an automatic recovery system, and a billion dollars in bank fees. So the net cost would be 8 billion 6 years from now in a trillion-plus budget  not very much. The other stuff  all the other stuff I mentioned  costs much less than that. The Head Start program full funding would cost about 5 billion more. And its all covered in my budget from  the plans that Ive laid out  from raising taxes on families with incomes above $200,000 and asking foreign corporations to pay the same tax that American corporations do on the same income, from $140 billion in budget cuts, including what I think are very prudent cuts in the defense budget. Its all covered in the plan.",1992-10-15,Democrat
Simpson,"Thank you. Mr. Perot, you on education, please.",1992-10-15,Moderator
Perot,"Yes, Ive got scars to show for being around education reform. And the first word you need to say in every city and state, and just draw a line in the sand, is public schools exist for the benefit of the children. Youre going to see a lot of people fall over it, because any time youre spending $199 billion dollars a year, somebodys getting it. And the children get lost in the process. So thats step one. Keep in mind in 1960, when our schools were the envy of the world, we were spending $16 billion on them; now we spend more than any other nation in the world  199 billion a year  and rank at the bottom of the industrialized world in terms of education achievement. One more time youve bought a front-row box seat and got a third-rate performance. This is a government that is not serving you. By and large it should be local  the more local, the better. Interesting phenomenon: small towns have good schools, big cities have terrible schools. The best people in a small town will serve on the school board; you get into big cities, its political patronage, stepping stones  you get the job, give your relatives a janitors job at $57,000 a year, more than the teachers make, and with luck they clean the cafeteria once a week. Now, youre paying for that. Those schools belong to you. And we put up with that. Now, as long as we put up with that, thats what youre going to get. And these folks are just dividing up 199 billion bucks and the children get lost. If I could wish for one thing for great public schools, it would be a strong family unit in every home  nothing will ever replace that. You say, well, gee, what are you going to do about that? Well, the White House is a bully pulpit, and I think we ought to be pounding on the table every day. Theres nothing  the most efficient unit of government the world will ever know is a strong loving family unit. Next thing. You need small schools, not big schools. In a little school everybody is somebody; individualism is very important. These big factories? Everybody told me they were cost-effective. I did a study on it; theyre cost- ineffective. 5000 students  why is a high school that big? One reason. Sooner or later you get 11 more boys that can run like the devil that weigh 250 pounds and they might win district. Now, that has nothing to do with learning. Secondly, across Texas, typically half of the school day was non-academic pursuits  in one place it was 35%. In Texas you could have unlimited absences to go to livestock shows. Found a boy  excuse me, but this gives the flavor  a boy in Houston kept a chicken in the bathtub in downtown Houston and missed 65 days going to livestock shows. Finally had to come back to school, the chicken lost its feathers. Thats the only way we got him back. (Laughter) Now, thats your tax money being wasted. Now, neighborhood schools. It is terrible to bus tiny little children across town. And it is particularly terrible to take poor tiny little children and wait until the first grade and bus them across town to Mars, where the children know their numbers, know their letters, have had every advantage. At the end of the first day, that little child wants out. Ill close on this. Youve got to have world class teachers, world class books. If you ever got close to how textbooks were selected, you wouldnt want to go back the second day. I dont have time to tell you the stories.",1992-10-15,Independent

And here youve got, for the disadvantaged children, youve got to have early childhood development. Cheapest money youll ever spend. First contact should be with the money when shes pregnant. That little child needs to be loved and hugged and nurtured and made to feel special, like your children were.

Bush,"I just had a word of clarification because of something Governor Clinton said. My school choice program, GI Bill for Kids, does not take public money and give it to private schools. It does what the GI Bill itself did when I came out of World War II. It takes public money and gives it to families or individuals to choose the school they want. And where its been done, those schools, like in Rochester, those schools that werent chosen find that they then compete and do better. So I think its worth a shot. Weve got a pilot program. It ought to be tried. School choice  public, private or religious. Not to the schools but to  you know, 46% of the teachers in Chicago, public school teachers, send their kids to private school. Now, I think we ought to try to help families and see if it will do what I think  make all schools better.",1992-10-15,Republican
Clinton,I just want to mention if I could,1992-10-15,Democrat
Simpson,Very briefly.,1992-10-15,Moderator
Clinton,"Very briefly. Including the parents in the preschool education of their kids, even if theyre poor and uneducated, can make a huge difference. We have a big program in my state that teaches mothers or fathers to teach their kids to get ready for school. Its the most successful thing weve ever done. Just a fact clarification real quickly. We do not spend a higher percentage of our income on public education than every other country. There are 9 countries that spend more than we do on public education. We spend more on education cause we spend so much more on colleges. But if you look at public education alone and you take into account the fact that we have more racial diversity and more poverty, it makes a big difference. There are great public schools where theres public school choice, accountability and brilliant principals. Ill just mention one  the Beasley Academic Center in Chicago. I commend it to anybody. Its as good as any private school in the country.",1992-10-15,Democrat

And you know, according to my mother and my wife and my daughter, this world would be a lot better place if women were running it most of the time. I do think there are special experiences and judgments and backgrounds and understandings that women bring to this process, by the way. This lady said here, how have you been affected by the economy. I mean, women know whats it like to be paid an unequal amount for equal work. They know what its like not to have flexible working hours. They know what its like not to have family leave or childcare. So I think it would be a good thing for America if it happened. And I think it will happen in my lifetime.",1992-10-15,Democrat

One is to raise taxes. One is to reduce spending  controlling that mandatory spending. Another one is to invest and save and to stimulate growth. I do not want to raise taxes. I differ with the 2 here on that. Im just not going to do that. I do believe that we need to control mandatory spending. I think we need to invest and save more. I believe that we need to educate better and retrain better. I believe that we need to export more so Ill keep working for export agreements where we can sell more abroad and I believe that we must strengthen the family. Weve got to strengthen the family. Now, let me pose this question to America. If in the next 5 minutes a television announcer came on and said, there is a major international crisis  there is a major threat to the world or in this country a major threat  my question is, who, if you were appointed to name 1 of the 3 of us, who would you choose?

If they just want to keep slow dancing and talk about it and not do it, Im not your man. I am results oriented. I am action oriented. Ive dealt my businesses. Getting things done in three months that my competitors took 18 months to do. Everybody says you cant do that with Congress. Sure, you can do that with Congress. Congress  theyre all good people. Theyre all patriots but youve got to link arms and work with them. Sure, youll have arguments. Sure, youll have fights. We have them all day every day. But we get the job done. Now, I have to come back in my clothes to one thing because I am passionate about education. I was talking about early childhood education for disadvantaged little children. And let me tell you one specific pilot program where children who dont have a chance go to this program when theyre 3. Now were going back to when the mothers pregnant and theyll start right after theyre born. Starting when theyre 3 and going to this school until theyre 9 and then going into the public school in the 4th grade. Ninety percent are on the honor role. Now that will change America. Those children will all go to college. They will live the American dream. And I beg the American people, any time they think about reforming education to take this piece of society that doesnt have a chance and take these little pieces of clay that can be shaped and molded and give them the same love and nurture and affection and support you give your children and teach them that theyre unique and that theyre precious and that theres only one person in the world like them and you will see this nation bloom. And we will have so many people who are qualified for the top job that it will be terrific. Now, finally, if you cant pay the bills youre dead in the water. And we have got to put our nation back to work. Now, if you dont want to really do that Im not your man. Id go crazy sitting up there slow dancing that one.

I really tried to be faithful to your request that we answer the questions specifically and pointedly. I thought I owed that to you and I respect you for being here and for the impact youve had on making this a more positive experience. These problems are not easy. Theyre not going to be solved overnight. But I want you to think about just 2 or 3 things. First of all, the people of my state have let me be their governor for 12 years because I made commitments to 2 things  more jobs and better schools. Our schools are now better. Our children get off to a better start from pre-school programs and smaller classes in the early grades, and we have one of the most aggressive adult education programs in the country. We talked about that. This year my state ranks first in the country in job growth, 4th in manufacturing in job growth, 4th in income growth, 4th in the decline of poverty. Im proud of that. It happened because I could work with people  Republicans and Democrats. Thats why weve had 24 retired generals and admirals, hundreds of business people, many of them Republican, support this campaign. You have to decide whether you want to change or not. We do not need 4 more years of an economic theory that doesnt work. Weve had 12 years of trickle down economics. Its time to put the American people first, to invest and grow this economy. Im the only person here whos ever balanced a government budget and Ive presented 12 of them and cut spending repeatedly. But you cannot just get there by balancing the budget. Weve got to grow the economy by putting people first  real people like you. I got into this race because I did not want my child to grow up to be part of the first generation of Americans to do worse than her parents. Were better than that. We can do better than that. I want to make America as great as it can be and I ask for your help in doing it. Thank you very much.",1992-10-15,Democrat

Im Susan Page of USA TODAY. It is my honor to moderate this debate, an important part of our democracy. In Kingsbury Hall tonight we have a small and socially distant audience and weve taken extra precautions during this pandemic. Among other things, everyone in the audience is required to wear a face mask and the candidates will be seated 12 feet apart. The audience is enthusiastic about their candidates, but theyve agreed to express that enthusiasm, only twice. At the end of the debate and now when I introduce the candidates. Please welcome California Senator Kamala Harris and Vice President Mike Pence.",2020-10-07,Moderator

Page,"Senator Harris and Vice President Pence thank you for being here. Were meeting as President Trump and the First Lady continue to undergo treatment in Washington after testing positive for COVID-19. We send our thoughts and prayers to them for their rapid and complete recovery and for the recovery of everyone afflicted by the coronavirus. The two campaigns and the Commission on Presidential Debates have agreed to the ground rules for tonight. Im here to enforce them on behalf of the millions of Americans who are watching. One note, no one in either campaign, or at the commission or anywhere else has been told in advance what topics Ill raise or what questions Ill ask. This ninety-minute debate will be divided into nine segments of about 10 minutes each. Ill begin a segment by posing a question to each of you, sometimes the same question, sometimes a different question on the same topic. You will then have two minutes to answer, without interruption by me or the other candidate. Then well take six minutes or so to discuss the issue. At that point, although there will always be more to say, well move on to the next topic. We want a debate that is lively, but Americans also deserve a discussion that is civil. These are tumultuous times, but we can and will have a respectful exchange about the big issues facing our nation. Lets begin with the ongoing pandemic that has cost our country so much. Senator Harris, the coronavirus is not under control. Over the past week, Johns Hopkins reports that 39 states have had more COVID cases over the past seven days than in the week before.

Harris,"Thank you Susan. Well, the American people have witnessed what is the greatest failure of any presidential administration in the history of our country. And here are the facts. 210,000 dead people in our country in just the last several months. Over 7 million people who have contracted this disease. One in five businesses closed. Were looking at frontline workers who have been treated like sacrificial workers. We are looking at over 30 million people who in the last several months had to file for unemployment. And heres the thing, on January 28, the vice president and the president were informed about the nature of this pandemic. They were informed that its lethal in consequence, that it is airborne, that it will affect young people and that it would be contracted because it is airborne. And they knew what was happening, and they didnt tell you. Can you imagine if you knew on January 28, as opposed to March 13, what they knew what you might have done to prepare? They knew and they covered it up. The president said it was a hoax. They minimized the seriousness of it. The president said youre on one side of his ledger if you wear a mask, youre on the other side of his ledger if you dont. And in spite of all of that, today they still dont have a plan. They still dont have a plan. Well, Joe Biden does. And our plan is about what we need to do around a national strategy for contact tracing, for testing, for administration of the vaccine and making sure that it will be free for all. That is the plan that Joe Biden has and that I have, knowing that we have to get a hold of what has been going on and we need to save our country. And Joe Biden is the best leader to do that and frankly, this administration has forfeited their right to reelection, based on this.",2020-10-07,Democrat

The US death toll as a percentage of our population is higher than that of almost every other wealthy nation on Earth. For instance, our death rate is two and a half times that of Canada, next door.

And you have two minutes to respond, without interruption.",2020-10-07,Moderator
Pence,"Susan thank you. And I want to thank the Commission and the University of Utah for hosting this event. And Senator Harris, its a privilege to be on the stage with you. Our nation has gone through a very challenging time this year. But I want the American people to know that from the very first day, President Donald Trump has put the health of America first. Before there were more than five cases in the United States, all people who had returned from China, President Donald Trump did what no other American president had ever done. And that was he suspended all travel from China, the second largest economy in the world. Now, Senator, Joe Biden opposed that decision. He said it was xenophobic and hysterical, but I can tell you, having led the White House Coronavirus Task Force, that that decision alone by President Trump bought us invaluable time to stand up the greatest national mobilization since World War II. And I believe its saved hundreds of thousands of American lives. Because with that time we were able to reinvent testing. More than 115 million tests have been done to date. We were able to see to the delivery of billions of supplies so our doctors and nurses had the resources and support they needed. And we began, really before the month of February it was hard to develop a vaccine and to develop medicines and therapeutics thatve been saving lives all along the way. And under President Trumps leadership, Operation Warp Speed, we believe, will have literally tens of millions of doses of a vaccine before the end of this year. The reality is, when you look at the Biden plan, it reads an awful lot like what President Trump and I and our task force have been doing every step of the way. And quite frankly, when I look at their plan that talks about advancing testing, creating new PPE, developing a vaccine, umm, it looks a little bit like plagiarism, which is something Joe Biden knows a little bit about. I think the American people know that this is a president who has put the health of America first and the American people, I believe with my heart, can be proud of the sacrifices they have made. Its saved countless American lives.",2020-10-07,Republican

And you know, the vice president is the head of the task force and knew, on January 28, how serious this was. And then, big thanks to Bob Woodward, we learned that they knew about it.

President Trump and I have great confidence in the American people and their ability to take that information and put it into practice. In the height of the epidemic, when we were losing a heartbreaking number of 2,500 Americans a day, we surged resources to New Jersey, and New York, and New Orleans and Detroit. We told the American people what needed to be done and the American people made the sacrifices. When the outbreak in the Sunbelt happened this summer, again, Americans stepped forward.

Donald Trump will be 74-years-old on Inauguration Day. Joe Biden will be 78-years-old. That already has raised concerns among some voters, concerns that have been sharpened by President Trumps hospitalization in recent days.

Pence,"Well, thank you but, I would like to go back. Because the reality is that were going to have a vaccine, Senator, in record time, in unheard of time, in less than a year. We have five companies in phase three clinical trials. And were right now producing tens of millions of doses. So, the fact that you continue to undermine public confidence in a vaccine if the vaccine emerges during the Trump administration, I think is unconscionable. And Senator, I just ask you, stop playing politics with peoples lives. The reality is that we will have a vaccine, we believe, before the end of this year, and it will have the capacity to save countless American lives. And your continuous undermining of confidence in a vaccine is just, its just unacceptable. And let me also say, you know the reality is when you talk about, about failure in this administration, we actually do know what failure looks like in a pandemic. It was 2009. The Swine Flu arrived in the United States. Thankfully, it was, ended up not being as lethal as the coronavirus. But before the end of the year, when Joe Biden was Vice President of the United States, not seven and a half million people contracted the swine flu, 60 million Americans contracted the swine flu. If the swine flu had been as lethal as the coronavirus in 2009 when Joe Biden was vice president, we would have lost 2 million American lives. His own Chief of Staff Ron Klain would say last year that it was pure luck. That they did everything possible wrong. And we learned from that. They left the Strategic National Stockpile empty. They left an empty and hollow plan, but we still learned from it. And I think",2020-10-07,Republican

Harris,"So let me tell you first of all, on the day I got the call from Joe Biden, it was actually a Zoom call, asking me to serve with him on this ticket was probably one of the most memorable, memorable days of my life. I, you know, I thought about my mother, who came to the United States at the age of 19, gave birth to me at the age of 25 at Kaiser Hospital in Oakland, California. And the thought that Id be sitting here right now I know would make her proud and she must be looking down on this. You know Joe and I were raised in a very similar way. We were raised with values that are about hard work, about the value and the dignity of public service and about the importance of fighting for the dignity of all people. And I think Joe asked me to serve with him because I have a career that included being elected the first woman District Attorney of San Francisco, where I created models of innovation for law enforcement, in terms of reform of the criminal justice system. I was elected the first woman of color, and black woman, to be elected Attorney General of the state of California, where I ran the second largest Department of Justice in the United States, second only to the United States Department of Justice. There I took on everything from transnational criminal organizations, to the big banks that were taking advantage of homeowners, to for profit colleges that were taking advantage of veterans. And then, of course, now I serve in the United States Senate as only the second black woman ever elected to the United States Senate. I serve on the Senate Intelligence Committee where Ive been in regular receipt of classified information about threats to our nation and hotspots around the world. Ive traveled the world. Ive met with our soldiers in our, in war zones. And I think Joe has asked me to serve with him because he knows that we share, we share a purpose, which is about lifting up the American people. And after the four years that we have seen of Donald Trump, unifying our country around our common values and principles.",2020-10-07,Democrat

You know neither, neither President Trump nor Vice President Biden has released the sort of detailed health information that had become the modern norm until the 2016 election.

And my question to each of you, in turn, is, is this information voters deserve to know? Vice President Pence, would you like to go first?",2020-10-07,Moderator
Pence,"Well, Susan, thank you. And let me, let me say on behalf of the President and the First Lady, how moved weve all been by the outpouring of prayers and concern for the President. And I do believe its emblematic of the prayers and the concern that have ushered forth for every American impacted by the coronavirus. But the care the president received at Walter Reed Hospital, White House doctors, was exceptional. And the transparency that they practiced all along the way will continue because the American people have a right to know about the health and well-being of their President. And well continue to do that. But Im just extremely grateful and was more than, more than a little moved by the broad and bipartisan support.

I wanna give Senator Harris a chance to respond to the same question I asked, which is do voters have a right to know more detailed health information about presidential candidates, and especially about presidents, especially when theyre facing some kind of challenge?",2020-10-07,Moderator
Harris,"Absolutely. And thats why Joe Biden has been so incredibly transparent. And certainly, by contrast, the President has not, both in terms of health records, but also lets look at taxes. We now know because of great investigative journalism that Donald Trump paid $750 in taxes. When I first heard about it, I literally said You mean $750,000?. And it was like no, $750. We now know Donald Trump owes and is in debt for $400 million. And just so everyone is clear, when we say in debt it means you owe money to somebody. And itd be really good to know who the President of the United States, the Commander in Chief, owes money to because the American people have a right to know what is influencing the presidents decisions. And is he making those decisions on the best interest of the American people, of you, or self interest. So, Susan, Im glad you asked about transparency, because it has to be across the board. Joe has been incredibly transparent over many, many years. The one thing we all know about Joe, he puts it all out there. He, he is honest. He is forthright. But Donald Trump on the other hand, has been about covering up everything.",2020-10-07,Democrat

On Friday, we learned that the unemployment rate had declined to 7.9% in September, but the job growth had stalled, and that was before the latest round of layoffs and furloughs in the airline industry, at Disney and elsewhere. Hundreds of thousands of discouraged workers have stopped looking for work. Nearly 11 million jobs that existed at the beginning of the year, havent been replaced. Those hardest hit include Latinos, blacks and women. Senator Harris, the Biden-Harris campaign has proposed new programs to boost the economy and you would pay for that new spending by raising $4 trillion in taxes on wealthy individuals and corporations. Some economists warn that could curb entrepreneurial ventures that fuel growth and create jobs. Would raising taxes put the recovery at risk? And you have two minutes to answer, uninterrupted.",2020-10-07,Moderator
Harris,"Thank you. On the issue of the economy, I think there couldnt be a more fundamental difference between Donald Trump and Joe Biden. Joe Biden believes you measure the health and the strength of Americas economy based on the health, and the strength of the American worker and the American family. On the other hand, you have Donald Trump, who measures the strength of the economy based on how rich people are doing. Which is why he passed a tax bill benefitting the top 1% and the biggest corporations of America, leading to a $2 trillion deficit that the American people are gonna have to pay for. On day one, Joe Biden will repeal that tax bill. Hell get rid of it. And what hell do with the money is invest it in the American people. And through a plan that is about investing in infrastructure, something that Donald Trump said he would do. I remember hearing about some infrastructure week, I dont think it ever happened. But Joe Biden will do that. Hell invest in infrastructure. Its about upgrading our roads and bridges, but also investing in clean energy and renewable energy. Joe is gonna invest that money in what we need to do around innovation. There was a time when our country believed in science and invested in research and development so that we were an innovation leader on the globe. Joe Biden will use that money to invest in education. So for example, for folks who want to go to a two year Community College, it will be free. If you come from a family that makes less than $125,000, youll go to a public university for free. And across the board, well make sure that if you have student loan debt its cut by $10,000. Thats how Joe Biden thinks about the economy, which is its about investing in the people of our country, as opposed to passing a tax bill, which had the benefit of letting American corporations go offshore to do their business.",2020-10-07,Democrat

When Joe Biden was vice president they tried to tax, and spend, and regulate, and bail our way back to a growing economy. President Trump cut taxes, across the board. Despite what Senator Harris says, the average American family of four had $2,000 in savings in taxes. And with the rise in wages that occurred, most predominantly for blue-collar, hardworking Americans, the average household income for a family of four increased by $4,000 following President Trumps tax cuts.

We literally have spared no expense to help the American people and the American worker through this. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris want to raise taxes. They want to bury our economy under a $2 trillion Green New Deal, which you were one of the original co-sponsors of in the United States Senate. They want to abolish fossil fuels and ban fracking, which would cost hundreds of thousands of American jobs all across the Heartland.

Joe Biden looked his supporter in the eye and pointed and said I guarantee, I guarantee that we will abolish fossil fuels. We have a $2 trillion version of the Green New Deal, Susan, that your newspaper USA TODAY said really wasnt that very different from the original Green New Deal. More taxes, more regulation, banning fracking, abolishing fossil fuel, crushing American energy and economic surrender to China is a prescription for economic decline. President Trump and I will keep America growing. The V-shape recovery thats underway right now will continue with four more years of President Donald Trump in the White House.",2020-10-07,Republican
Page,"Thank you very, very much, Vice President Pence. Once again you provided the perfect segue to a new topic, which is climate change. And Vice President Pence, Id like to pose the first question to you. This year weve seen record-setting hurricanes in the south. Another one, Hurricane Delta is now threatening the gulf. And we have seen record-setting wildfires in the West. Do you believe, as the scientific community has concluded, that man-made climate change has made wildfires bigger, hotter and more deadly? And it made hurricanes wetter, slower and more damaging? You have two minutes, uninterrupted.",2020-10-07,Moderator
Pence,"Thank you Susan. Well first, Im very proud of our record on the environment and on conservation. According to all of the best estimates, our, our air and land are cleaner than any time ever recorded. And our water is among the cleanest in the world. And just a little while ago, the president signed the Outdoors Act, the largest investment in our public lands and public parks in 100 years. So, President Trump has made a commitment to conservation and to the environment. Now with regard to climate change, the climate is changing. But the issue is, whats the cause and what do we do about it. President Trump has made it clear that were going to continue to listen to the science. Now Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, would put us back in the Paris Climate Accord. Theyd impose the Green New Deal, which would crush American energy, would increase the energy cost of American families in their homes and literally would crush American jobs. President Trump and I believe that the progress that we have made in a cleaner environment has been happening precisely because we have a strong free market economy. You know whats remarkable is the United States has reduced CO2 more than the countries that are still in the Paris Climate Accord, but weve done it through innovation. And weve done it through natural gas and fracking, which, Senator, the American people can go look at the record. I know Joe Biden says otherwise now, as you do, but the both of you repeatedly committed to abolishing fossil fuel and banning fracking.",2020-10-07,Republican
Harris,Thats not true.,2020-10-07,Democrat
Pence,"And so by creating the kind of American innovation, were actually steering toward a stronger and better environment. With regard to wildfires, President Trump and I believe that forest management has to be front and center, and even Governor Gavin Newsome from your state has agreed weve got to work on forest management.

Senator Harris, as the Vice President mentioned, you co-sponsored the Green New Deal in Congress, but Vice President Biden said in last weeks debate that he does not support the Green New Deal. But if you look at the Biden Harris campaign website it describes the Green New Deal as a crucial framework. What exactly would be the stance of a Biden Harris Administration toward the Green New Deal? You have two minutes, uninterrupted.",2020-10-07,Moderator
Harris,"Alright, so first of all, I will repeat, and the American people know, that Joe Biden will not ban fracking. That is a fact. That is a fact. I will repeat that Joe Biden has been very clear that he thinks about growing jobs, which is why he will not increase taxes for anyone who makes less than $400,000 a year. Joe Bidens economic plan  Moodys, which is a reputable Wall Street firm  has said will create 7 million more jobs than Donald Trumps. And part of those jobs, that will be created by Joe Biden, are going to be about clean energy and renewable energy. Because you see, Joe understands that the West Coast of our country is burning, including my home state of California. Joe sees what is happening on the Gulf states, which are being battered by storms. Joe has seen and talked with the farmers in Iowa, whose entire crops have been destroyed because of floods. And so Joe believes, again, in science. Ill tell you something, Susan, I served, when I first got to the Senate, on the committee thats responsible for the environment. Do you know this administration took the word science off the website? And then took the phrase climate change off the website? This We have seen a pattern with this administration which is they dont believe in science. And Joes plan is about saying were going to deal with it, but were also going to create jobs. Donald Trump, when asked about the wildfires in California and the question was, you know, the science is telling us this, you know what Donald Trump said? Science doesnt know. So, lets talk about who is prepared to lead our country over the course of the next four years on what is an existential threat to us as human beings. Joe is about saying were going to invest that in renewable energy, were going to be about the creation of millions of jobs, we will achieve net zero emissions by 2050, carbon neutral by 2035 Joe has a plan. This has been a lot of talk from the Trump administration, and really it has been to go backward instead of forward. We will also reenter the climate agreement with pride.",2020-10-07,Democrat

Pence,"As I said, Susan, the climate is changing. Well follow the science, but, once again, Senator Harris is denying the fact that theyre gonna raise taxes on every American. Joe Biden said twice in the debate last week that on day one he was going to repeal the Trump tax cuts. Those tax cuts delivered $2,000 in tax relief to the average family of four across America. And with regard to banning fracking, I just recommend that people look at the record. You yourself said repeatedly that you would ban fracking. You were the first senate co-sponsor of the Green New Deal. And while Joe Biden denied the Green New Deal, Susan, thank you for pointing out, the Green New Deal is on their campaign website. And as USA TODAY said, its essentially the same plan as you co-sponsored with AOC when she submitted it in the Senate. And you just heard the senator say that shes going to resubmit America to the Paris Climate Accord. Look, the American people have always cherished our environment. We will continue to cherish it. Weve made great progress reducing CO2 emissions through American innovation and the development of natural gas through fracking. We dont need a massive, $2 trillion Green New Deal that would impose all new mandates on American businesses and American families, Joe Biden wants us to retrofit 4 million",2020-10-07,Republican

It is a huge market for American agricultural goods. Its a potential partner in dealing with climate change and North Korea.

Competitors? Adversaries? Enemies? You have two minutes.",2020-10-07,Moderator
Pence,"Thank you Susan. Well let me, before I leave that, let me, let me speak to voting records, if I can. You know, everybody knows that NAFTA caused literally thousands of American factories to close. We saw automotive jobs go south of the border. President Trump fought to renegotiate NAFTA, and the United States, Mexico, Canada agreement is now the law of the land. American people deserve to know Senator Kamala Harris was one of only 10 members of the Senate to vote against the USMCA. It was a huge win for American auto workers. It was a huge win for American farmers, especially dairy in the upper Midwest. But, Senator, you said it didnt go far enough on climate change, that you put your, your radical environmental agenda ahead of American auto workers and ahead of American jobs. I think the American people deserve to know that. Its probably why Newsweek magazine said that, that Kamala Harris was the most liberal member of the United States Senate in 2019, more liberal than Bernie Sanders, more, more liberal than any of the others in the United States Senate. So, now with regard to China, Susan, first and foremost  China is to blame for the coronavirus. And President Trump is not happy about it. Hes made that very clear. He made it clear again today. China and the World Health Organization did not play straight with the American people. They did not let our personnel into China to get information on the coronavirus until the middle of February. Fortunately, President Trump, in dealing with China from the outset of this administration  standing up to China, that had been taking advantage of America for decades  in the wake of Joe Bidens cheerleading for China, President Trump made that decision before the end of January to suspend all travel from China. And again, the American people deserve to know, Joe Biden opposed President Trumps decision to suspend all travel from China.

Harris,"Susan, the Trump administrations perspective, and approach to China has resulted in the loss of American lives, American jobs and Americas standing. There is a weird obsession that President Trump has had with getting rid of whatever accomplishment was achieved by President Obama and Vice President Biden. For example, they created, within the White House, an office that basically was responsible for monitoring pandemics. They got away, they got rid of it.",2020-10-07,Democrat
Pence,Not true.,2020-10-07,Republican
Harris,"There was a team of disease experts that President Obama and Vice President Biden dispatched to China to monitor what is now predictable and what might happen. They pulled them out. We now are looking at 210,000 Americans who have lost their lives. Lets look at the job situation we mentioned before, the trade deal  the trade war, they wanted to call it  with China. It resulted in the loss of over 300 manufacturing jobs, and a manufacturing recession, and the American consumer paying thousands of dollars more for goods, because of that failed war, that they called it. And lets talk about standing. Pew, a reputable research firm, has done an analysis that shows that leaders of all of our formerly allied countries have now decided that they hold in greater esteem and respect Xi Jinping, the head of the Chinese Communist Party, than they do Donald Trump, the President of the United States, the commander in chief of the United States. This is where we are today, because of a failure of leadership by this administration.",2020-10-07,Democrat

Whats your definition  weve seen strains with China, of course, as the Vice President mentioned, weve seen strains with our traditional allies in NATO and elsewhere. What is your definition of the role of American leadership in 2020?",2020-10-07,Moderator
Harris,"So, you know Joe is  I love talking with Joe about a lot of these issues, and you know, Joe, I think, he said it, quite well. He says, you know, Foreign policy: it might sound complicated, but really its relationships, theyre  just think about it as relationships. And so we know this, in our personal, professional relationships  you gotta keep your word to your friends. Got to be loyal to your friends. People who have stood with you, got to stand with them. You got to know who your adversaries are, and keep them in check. But what we have seen with Donald Trump is that he has betrayed our friends and embraced dictators around the world. Lets take for example, Russia. So, Russia  I serve on the Intelligence Committee of the United States Senate. Americas intelligence community told us Russia interfered in the election of the President of the United States in 2016 and is playing in 2020. Christopher Wray, the director of the FBI, said the same, but Donald Trump, the commander in chief of the United States of America prefers to take the word of Vladimir Putin over the word of the American intelligence community. You look at our friends at NATO. He has walked away from agreements  you can look at the Iran nuclear deal, which now has put us in a position where we are less safe, because they are building up what might end up being a significant nuclear arsenal. We were in that deal, guys, we were in the Iran nuclear deal with friends, with allies around the country, and because of Donald Trumps unilateral approach to foreign policy, coupled with his isolationism, he pulled us out and has made America less safe. So Susan, its about relationships. And the thing that has always been part of the strength of our nation, in addition to our great military, has been that we keep our word. But Donald Trump doesnt understand that, because he doesnt understand what it means to be honest.",2020-10-07,Democrat

Pence,"Well, thank you. Well, President Trump kept his word when we moved the American Embassy to Jerusalem, the capital of the State of Israel. When Joe Biden was vice president, they promised to do that and never did. Weve stood strong with our allies, but weve been demanding. NATO is now contributing more to our common defense than ever before. Thanks to President Trumps leadership, weve strengthen our alliances across the Asia Pacific. And weve stood strong against those who would do us harm. You know when President Trump came into office, ISIS had captured an area of the Middle East, the size of Pennsylvania. President Trump unleashed the American military, and our armed forces destroyed the ISIS caliphate and took down their leader al Baghdadi without one American casualty. al Baghdadi was responsible for the death of thousands. But notably, Americas hearts today are with the family of Kayla Mueller, the parents of which are here with us tonight in Salt Lake City. Today, two of the ISIS killers responsible for Kayla Muellers murder, were brought to justice in the United States. Jihadi John was killed on the battlefield, along with the other few. The reality is that when Joe Biden was vice president, we had an opportunity to save Kayla Mueller. Breaks my heart to reflect on it, but the military came into the Oval Office, presented a plan. They said they knew where Kayla was. Baghdadi had held her for 18 months, abused her mercilessly before they killed her. But when Joe Biden was vice president, they hesitated for a month. And when Armed Forces finally went in, it was clear shed been moved two days earlier, and her family says  with a heart that broke the heart of every American  that if President Donald Trump had been president, they believe Kayla would be alive today.",2020-10-07,Republican

And I know Joe feels the same way. And I know that President Obama feels the same way. But you mentioned Soleimani. Lets start there. So, after the strike on Soleimani, there was a counter strike on our troops in Iraq. And they suffered serious brain injuries, and do you know what Donald Trump dismissed them as? Headaches. And this is about a pattern of Donald Trumps, where he has referred to our men who are serving in our military, as suckers and losers. Donald Trump, who went to Arlington Cemetery, and stood above the graves of our fallen heroes and said, Whats in it for them? Because, of course, you know he only thinks about whats in it for him. Lets take what he said about John McCain. A great American hero. And Donald Trump says he doesnt deserve to be called a hero because he was a prisoner of war. Take  and this is, this is very important. When you want to talk about who is the current commander in chief, and what they care about and what they dont care about. Public reporting that Russia had bounties on the heads of American soldiers, and you know what a bounty is? Somebody puts a price on your head, and they will pay it if you are killed. And Donald Trump had talked at least six times to Vladmir Putin, and never brought up the subject. Joe Biden would never do that.

So I want to go ahead and move to the next topic, which is an important one, as the last topic was, and that is the Supreme Court. On Monday, the Senate Judiciary Committee is scheduled to open hearings on Amy Coney Barretts nomination to the Supreme Court. Senator Harris, youll be there as a member of the committee. Her confirmation would cement the courts conservative majority, and make it likely open to more abortion restrictions, even to overturning the landmark Roe v Wade ruling. Access to abortion would then be up to the states. Vice President Pence, youre the former governor of Indiana. If Roe v Wade is overturned, what would you want Indiana to do? Would you want your home state to ban all abortions? You have two minutes, uninterrupted.",2020-10-07,Moderator
Pence,"Well thank you for the question, but Ill use a little bit of my time to respond to that very important issue before. The American people deserve to know, Quasem Soleimani, the Iranian general, was responsible for the death of hundreds of American servicemembers. When the opportunity came, we saw him headed to Baghdad to kill more Americans, President Trump didnt hesitate and Quasem Soleimani is gone. But you deserve to know that Joe Biden and Kamala Harris actually criticized the decision to take out Quasem Soleimani. Its really inexplicable, but with regard to Joe Biden its explainable, because history records that Joe Biden actually opposed the raid against Osama bin Laden. Its absolutely essential that we have a commander in chief who will not hesitate to act to protect American lives and to protect American servicemembers, and thats what you have in President Donald Trump. Now with regard to the Supreme Court of the United States. Let me say, President Trump and I could not be more enthusiastic about the opportunity to see Judge Amy Coney Barrett become Justice Amy Coney Barrett. Shes a brilliant woman, and she will bring a lifetime of experience and a sizable American family, to the Supreme Court of the United States. And our hope is, in the hearing next week, unlike Justice Kavanaugh received with treatment from you and others. We hope she gets a fair hearing. And we particularly hope that we dont see the kind of attacks on her Christian faith that we saw before. Democratic Chairman of the Judiciary Committee before, when Judge Barrett was being confirmed for the Court of Appeals, expressed concern that the dogma of her faith lived loudly in her. Dick Durbin of Illinois said that it was a concern. Senator, I know one of our judicial nominees, you actually attacked because they were a member of the Catholic Knights of Columbus, just because the Knights of Columbus holds pro-life views.",2020-10-07,Republican

If Roe v Wade is overturned, what would you want California to do? Would you want your home state to enact no restrictions on access to abortion? And you have two minutes, uninterrupted.",2020-10-07,Moderator
Pence,"Thank you, Susan. First of all, Joe Biden and I are both people of faith. And its insulting to suggest that we would knock anyone for their faith, and in fact, Joe if elected will be only the second practicing Catholic, as President of the United States. On the issue of this nomination  Joe and I are very clear, as are the majority of the American people. We are 27 days before the decision about who will be the next president of the United States. And you know before, when this conversation has come up, you know its been about election year or election time. Were literally in an election. Over 4 million people have voted. People are in the process of voting right now. And so Joe has been very clear, as the American people are: Let the American people fill that seat in the White House, and then well fill that seat on the United States Supreme Court. And to your point, Susan, the issues before us couldnt be more serious. Theres the issue of choice, and I will always fight for a womans right to make a decision about her own body. It should be her decision and not that of Donald Trump, and the Vice President, Michael Pence. But lets also look at what else is before the court. Its the Affordable Care Act. Like, literally in the midst of a public health pandemic  when over 210,000 people have died and 7 million people probably have what will be in the future considered a pre-existing condition because you contracted the virus  Donald Trump is in court right now trying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act. And Ive said it before and it bears repeating: This means that there will be no more protections, if they win, for people with pre-existing conditions. This means that over 20 million people will lose your coverage. It means that if youre under the age of 26, you cant stay on your parents coverage anymore. And heres the thing. The contrast couldnt be more clear. Theyre trying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act. Joe Biden is saying lets expand coverage, lets give you a choice of a public option or private coverage, lets bring down premiums, lets lower Medicare eligibility to 60. Thats true leadership.",2020-10-07,Republican
Page,"You know, you mentioned earlier, Vice President Pence, that the President was committed to maintaining protections for people with pre-existing conditions and  but you do have this court case that you are supporting, your administration is supporting, that would strike down the Affordable Care Act. The president says, President Trump says, that hes going to protect people with pre-existing conditions, but he has not explained how he will do that. And that was one of the toughest nuts to crack, when they were passing the Affordable Care Act. So, tell us, specifically  how would your administration protect Americans with pre-existing conditions, have access to affordable insurance if the Affordable Care Act is struck down.",2020-10-07,Moderator
Pence,"Well, thank you, Susan. Let me just say, addressing your very first question, I couldnt be more proud to serve as vice president to a President who stands without apology for the sanctity of human life. Im pro-life. I dont apologize for it. And this is another one of those cases where theres such a dramatic contrast. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris support taxpayer funding of abortion, all the way up to the moment of birth, late-term abortion. They want to increase funding to Planned Parenthood of America. Now for our part, I would never presume how Judge Amy Coney Barrett would rule on the Supreme Court of the United States but well continue to stand strong for the right to life. When you speak about the Supreme Court, though, I think the American people really deserve an answer, Senator Harris. Are you and Joe Biden gonna pack the court if Judge Amy Coney Barrett is confirmed? I mean, there have been 29 vacancies on the Supreme Court during presidential election years, from George Washington to Barack Obama. Presidents have nominated in all 29 cases. But your party is actually openly advocating adding seats to the Supreme Court, which has had nine seats for 150 years, if you dont get your way. This is a classic case of if you cant win by the rules, youre going to change the rules. Now youve refused to answer the question, Joe Biden has refused to answer the question. I think the American people would really like to know. If Judge Amy Coney Barrett is confirmed to the Supreme Court of the United States, are you and Joe Biden, if somehow you win this election, going to pack the Supreme Court to get your way?",2020-10-07,Republican

Pence,"Well, Id like you to answer the question.",2020-10-07,Republican
Harris,"Mr. Vice President, Im speaking. Im speaking. In 1864, one of the, I think, political heroes  certainly of the president, and I assume of you also, Mr. Vice President  is Abraham Lincoln. Abraham Lincoln was up for reelection, and it was 27 days before the election, and a seat became open on the United States Supreme Court. Abraham Lincolns party was in charge, not only in the White House, but the Senate. But honest Abe said its not the right thing to do. The American people deserve to make the decision about who will be the next President of the United States, and then that person can select who will serve for a lifetime on the highest court of our land. And so Joe and I are very clear: the American people are voting right now. And it should be their decision about who will serve on this most important body for a lifetime.",2020-10-07,Democrat

And Ive witnessed the appointments, for lifetime appointments to the federal courts, district courts, Courts of Appeal  people who are purely ideological people who have been reviewed by legal professional organizations and found to have been not competent, are substandard. And do you know that of the 50 people who President Trump appointed to the Court of Appeals for lifetime appointments, not one is Black? This is what theyve been doing.

Page,"Thank you, Vice President. In March, Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old emergency room technician in Louisville, was shot and killed after police officers executing a search warrant on a narcotics investigation broke into her apartment. The police said they identified themselves. Taylors boyfriend said he didnt hear them do that. He used a gun registered to him to fire a shot, which wounded an officer. The officers then fired more than 20 rounds into the apartment. They say they were acting in self-defense. None of them have been indicted in connection with her death. Senator Harris, in the case of Breonna Taylor, was justice done? You have two minutes.",2020-10-07,Moderator
Harris,"I dont believe so, and Ive talked with Breonnas mother, Tamika Palmer, and her family, and her family deserves justice. She was a beautiful young woman. She had as her life goal to become a nurse, and she wanted to become an EMT to first learn whats going on out on the street, so she could then become a nurse and save lives. And her life was taken, unjustifiably and tragically and violently. And it just, it brings me to, you know, the eight minutes and 46 seconds that America witnessed, during which an American man was tortured and killed under the knee of an armed, uniformed police officer. And people around our country, of every race, of every age, of every gender  perfect strangers to each other  marched shoulder to shoulder, arm and arm, fighting for us to finally achieve that ideal of equal justice under law. And I was a part of those peaceful protests. And I believe strongly that, first of all, we are never going to condone violence, but we always must fight for the values that we hold dear, including the fight to achieve our ideals. And thats why Joe Biden and I have said on this subject, look, and Im a former career prosecutor. I know what Im talking about. Bad cops are bad for good cops. We need reform of our policing in America and our criminal justice system, which is why Joe and I will immediately ban chokeholds and carotid holds. George Floyd would be alive today if we did that. We will require a national registry for police officers who break the law, we will  on the issue of criminal justice reform  get rid of private prisons and cash bail and we will decriminalize marijuana, and we will expunge the records of those who have been convicted of marijuana. This is a time for leadership. On a tragic, tragic issue",2020-10-07,Democrat

Pence,"Well our heart breaks for the loss of any innocent American life, and the family of Breonna Taylor has our sympathies. But I trust our justice system, a grand jury that reviews the evidence. And it really is remarkable, that as a former prosecutor, you would assume that in a panel grand jury, looking at all the evidence, got it wrong. But youre entitled to your opinion, Senator. And with regard to George Floyd, theres no excuse for what happened to George Floyd. Justice will be served. But theres also no excuse for the rioting and looting that followed. I mean, it really is astonishing. Flora Westbrook is with us here tonight in Salt Lake City. Just a few weeks ago, I stood at what used to be her salon, was burned to the ground. By rioters and looters. And Flora is still trying to put her life back together. And I must tell ya, this, this presumption that you hear consistently from Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, that America is systemically racist. That as Joe Biden said, that he believes that law enforcement has an implicit bias against minorities, is a great insult to the men and women who serve in law enforcement. And I want everyone to know, who puts on the uniform of law enforcement every day, that President Trump and I stand with you. It is remarkable that when Senator Tim Scott tried to pass a police reform bill, brought together a group of Republicans and Democrats  Senator Harris, you got up and walked out of the room. And then you filibustered Senator Tim Scotts bill on the Senate floor that would have provided new accountability, new resources. But we dont have to choose between supporting law enforcement, improving public safety, and supporting our African American neighbors and all of our minorities.

He, on the issue of Charlottesville, where people were peacefully protesting the need for racial justice, where a young woman was killed and on the other side there were neo-Nazis carrying tiki torches shouting racial epithets, anti semitic slurs.

Senator Harris conveniently omitted, after the President made comments about people on either side of the debate over monuments, he condemned the KKK, neo-Nazis and white supremacists and has done so repeatedly.

We were the first to initiate a requirement that there would be a training for law enforcement on implicit bias, because yes, Joe Biden and I recognize that implicit bias does exist, Mr. Vice President, contrary to what you may believe. We did the work of instituting reforms that were about investing in reentry. This is the work that we have done and the work we will do going forward and, again, I will not be lectured by the Vice President, on our record of what we have done in terms of law enforcement and keeping our community safe and a commitment to reforming the criminal justice system of America.",2020-10-07,Democrat

President Trump has, several times, refused to commit himself to a peaceful transfer of power after the election. If your ticket wins and President Trump refuses to accept a peaceful transfer of power, what steps would you and Vice President Biden then take? What would happen next? You have two minutes.",2020-10-07,Moderator
Harris,"So, Ill tell you. Joe and I are particularly proud of the coalition that weve built around our campaign. We probably have one of the broadest coalitions of folks that youve ever seen in a presidential race. Of course we have the support of Democrats, but also independents and Republicans, in fact, seven members of President George W. Bushs cabinet are supporting our ticket. We have the support of Colin Powell, Cindy McCain, John Kasich, over 500 generals, retired generals, and former national security experts and advisors are supporting our campaign. And I believe they are doing that because they know that Joe Biden has a deep, deep seated commitment to fight for our democracy, and to fight for the integrity of our democracy, and to bring integrity back to the White House. And so, we believe in the American people. We believe in our democracy. And heres what Id like to say to everybody: vote. Please vote, vote early, come up with a plan to vote, go to IWillVote.com. You can also go to Joe Biden.com. We have it within our power in these next 27 days to make the decision about what will be the course of our country for the next four years. And it is within our power, and if we use our vote, and we use our voice, we will win. And we will not let anyone subvert our democracy, with what Donald Trump has been doing as he did on the debate stage last week, when again in front of 70 million people, he openly attempted to suppress the vote. Joe Biden, on the other hand, on that same debate stage  because clearly Donald Trump doesnt think he can run on a record because its a failed record  Joe Biden on that stage, said, Hey, just please vote. So Ill repeat what Joe said. Please vote.",2020-10-07,Democrat

If Vice President Biden is declared the winner and President Trump refuses to accept a peaceful transfer of power, what would be your role and responsibility as Vice President? What would you personally do? You have two minutes.",2020-10-07,Moderator
Pence,"Well, Susan, first and foremost, I think were gonna win this election. Because while Joe Biden and Kamala Harris rattle off a long litany, the establishment in Washington DC and the establishment Joe Bidens been a part of for 47 years. President Donald Trump has launched a movement of everyday Americans from every walk of life. And I have every confidence that the same Americans that delivered that historic victory in 2016, they see this Presidents record, where we rebuild our military, we revived our economy through tax cuts and rolling back regulation, fighting for fair trade, unleashing American energy. We appointed conservatives to our federal courts at every level. And we stood with the men and women of law enforcement every single day, and I think, I think that movement of Americans has only grown stronger in the last four years. When you talk about accepting the outcome of the election, I must tell you, Senator, your party has spent the last three and a half years trying to overturn the results of the last election. Its amazing. When Joe Biden was vice president of the United States, the FBI actually spied on President Trump and my campaign. I mean there were documents released this week that the CIA actually made a referral to the FBI documenting that those allegations were coming from the Hillary Clinton campaign, and of course, weve all seen the avalanche with the  what, what you put the country through, for the better part of three years, until it was found that there was no obstruction, no collusion, case closed. And then Senator Harris, you and your colleagues in the Congress tried to impeach the President of the United States, over a phone call. And now Hillary Clinton has actually said to Joe Biden that under, in her words, under no circumstances should he concede the election. So let me just say, I think were gonna win this election. President Trump and I are fighting every day in courthouses to prevent Joe Biden and Kamala Harris from changing the rules and creating this universal mail-in voting, thatll create a massive opportunity for voter fraud. We have a free and fair election; we know were going to have confidence in it. And I believe in all my heart that President Donald Trumps gonna be reelected for four more years.",2020-10-07,Republican

Shes an eighth grader at Springville Junior High in Springville, Utah, and heres what she wrote. Quote  When I watch the news, all I see is arguing between Democrats and Republicans. When I watch the news, all I see is citizen fighting against citizen. When I watch the news, all I see are two candidates from opposing parties, trying to tear each other down. If our leaders cant get along, how are the citizens supposed to get along? And then she added, Your examples could make all the difference to bring us together  end quote.

Pence,"Brecklynn, its a wonderful question. And let me just commend you for taking an interest in public life. I started following the news when I was very young. And in America, we believe in a free and open exchange of debate. And we celebrate that, and its how weve created literally the freest and most prosperous nation in the history of the world. I would tell you that  dont assume that what youre seeing on your local news networks is synonymous with the American people. You know, I look at the relationship between Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the late justice who we just lost from the Supreme Court, and the late Justice Antonin Scalia. They were on polar opposites, on the Supreme Court of the United States  one very liberal, one very conservative. But whats been learned since her passing was the two of them and their families were the very closest of friends. Here in America, we can disagree, we can debate vigorously as Senator Harris and I have on this stage tonight. But when the debate is over, we come together as Americans. And thats what people do in big cities and small towns all across this country, so I just want to encourage you, Brecklynn, I want to tell you that were going to work every day to have a government as good as our people, the American people, each and every day. We love a good debate. We love a good argument. But we always come together and are always there for one another in times of need. And weve especially learned that through the difficulties of this year.",2020-10-07,Republican
Page,"Thank you, Vice President. Senator Harris, what would you say to Brecklynn?",2020-10-07,Moderator
Harris,"First of all, I love hearing from our young leaders, and when I hear her words, when I hear your words, Brecklynn, I know our future is bright, because it is that perspective on who we are and who we should be  that is a sign of leadership and is something we should all aspire to be. And that you know that brings me to Joe. Joe Biden  one of the reasons that Joe decided to run for president, is after Charlottesville, which we talked about earlier, it so troubled him and upset him, like it did all of us, that there was that kind of hate and division. What propelled Joe to run for president was to see that, over the course of the last four years, what Brecklynn described has been happening. Joe has a long-standing reputation of working across the aisle and working in a bipartisan way. And thats what hes going to do as President. Joe Biden has a history of lifting people up and fighting for their dignity. You mean you have to know Joes story to know that Joe has known pain, he has known suffering, and he has known love. And so, Brecklynn, when you think about the future, I do believe the future is bright. And it will be because of your leadership, and it will be, because we fight for each persons voice through their vote. And we get engaged in this election, because you have the ability through your work, and through, eventually, your vote. To determine the future of our country, and what its leadership looks like.",2020-10-07,Democrat

Ms. Frederick,"Good evening. Im Pauline Frederick of NPR, moderator of this second of the historic debates of the 1976 campaign between Gerald R, Ford of Michigan, Republican candidate for president, and Jimmy Carter of Georgia, Democratic candidate for president. Thank you, President Ford and thank you, Governor Carter, for being with us tonight. This debate takes place before an audience in the Palace of Fine Arts Theater in San Francisco. An estimated one hundred million Americans are watching on television as well. San Francisco was the site of the signing of the United Nations Charter, thirty one years ago. Thus, it is an appropriate place to hold this debate, the subject of which is foreign and defense issues. The questioners tonight are Max Frankel, associate editor of the New York Times, Henry L. Trewhitt, diplomatic correspondent of the Baltimore Sun, and Richard Valeriani, diplomatic correspondent of NBC News. The ground rules are basically the same as they were for the first debate two weeks ago. The questions will be alternated between candidates. By the toss of a coin, Governor Carter will take the first question. Each question sequence will be as follows: The question will be asked and the candidate will have up to three minutes to answer. His opponent will have up to two minutes to respond. And prior to the response, the questioner may ask a follow-up question to clarify the candidates answer when necessary with up to two minutes to reply. Each candidate will have three minutes for a closing statement at the end. President Ford and Governor Carter do not have notes or prepared remarks with them this evening, but they may take notes during the debate and refer to them. Mr. Frankel, you have the first question for Governor Carter.",1976-10-06,Moderator
Mr. Frankel,"Governor, since the Democrats last ran our foreign policy, including many of the men who are advising you, country has been relieved of the Vietnam agony and the military draft, weve started arms control negotiations with the Russians, weve opened relations with China, weve arranged the disengagement in the Middle East, weve regained influence with the Arabs without deserting Israel, now, maybe weve even begun a process of peaceful change in Africa. Now youve objected in this campaign to the style with which much of this was done, and youve mentioned some other things that  that you think ought to have been done. But do you really have a quarrel with this Republican record? Would you not have done any of those things?",1976-10-06,Moderator
Mr. Carter,"Well I think this Republican administration has been almost all style, and spectacular, and not substance. Weve uh  got a chance tonight to talk about, first of all, leadership, the character of our country, and a vision of the future. In every one of these instances, the Ford administration has failed, and I hope tonight that I and Mr. Ford will have a chance to discuss the reasons for those failures. Our country is not strong anymore; were not respected anymore. We can only be strong overseas if were strong at home; and when I became president well not only be strong in those areas but also in defense  a defense capability second to none. Weve lost in our foreign policy, the character of the American people. Weve uh  ignored or excluded the American people and the Congress from participation in the shaping of our foreign policy. Its been one of secrecy and exclusion. In addition to that weve had a chance to became now, contrary to our long-standing beliefs and principles, the arms merchant of the whole world. Weve tried to buy success from our enemies, and at the same time weve excluded from the process the normal friendship of our allies. In addition to that weve become fearful to compete with the Soviet Union on an equal basis. We talk about detente. The Soviet Union knows what they want in detente, and theyve been getting it. We have not known what weve wanted and weve been out-traded in almost every instance. The other point I wanna make is about our defense. Weve got to be a nation blessed with a defense capability thats efficient, tough, capable, well organized, narrowly focused  fighting capability. The ability to fight, if necessary, is the best way to avoid the chance for, or the requirement to fight. And the last point I wanna make is this: Mr. Ford, Mr. Kissinger have uh  continued on with the policies and failures of Richard Nixon. Even the Republican platform has criticized the lack of leadership in Mr. Ford and theyve criticized the foreign policy of this administration. This is one instance where I agree with  with the Republican platform. I might say this in closing, and that is that as far as foreign policy goes, Mr. Kissinger has been the president of this country. Mr. Ford has shown an absence of leadership, and an absence of a grasp of what this country is and what it ought to be. Thats got to be changed. And thats one of the major issues in this uh  campaign of 1976.",1976-10-06,Democrat
Ms. Frederick,"President Ford, would you like to respond?",1976-10-06,Moderator
Mr. Ford,"Governor Carter again is talking in broad generalities. Let me take just one question that he raises  the military strength and capability of the United States. Governor Carter in November of 1975 indicated that he wanted to cut the defense budget by $15 billion. A few months later, he said he wanted to cut the defense budget by eight or nine billion dollars. And more recently, he talks about cutting the defense budget by five to seven billion dollars. There is no way you can be strong militarily and have those kind of reductions in our military uh  appropriation. Now let me just tell you a little story. About uh  late October of 1975, I asked the then Secretary of Defense, Mr. Schlesinger, to tell me what had to be done if we were going to reduce the defense budget by uh  three to five billion dollars. A few days later, Mr. Schlesinger came back and said if we cut the defense budget by three to five billion dollars, we will have to cut military personnel by two hundred and fifty thousand, civilian personnel by a hundred thousand, jobs in America by a hundred thousand. We would have to stretch out our aircraft procurement, we would have to reduce our naval construction program, we would have to reduce the uh  research and development for the Army, the Navy, the Air Force and Marines by 8 percent. We would have to close twenty military bases in the United States immediately. Thats the kind of defense program that uh  Mr. Carter wants. Let me tell you this straight from the shoulder. You dont negotiate with Mr. Brezhnev from weakness. And the kind of defense program that Mr. Carter wants will mean a weaker defense and a poor negotiating position.",1976-10-06,Republican
Ms. Frederick,"Mr. Trewhitt, a question for President Ford.",1976-10-06,Moderator
Mr. Trewhitt,"Mr. President, my question really is the other side of the coin from Mr. Frankels. For a generation the United States has had a foreign policy based on containment of Communism. Yet we have lost the first war in Vietnam; we lost a shoving match in Angola. Uh  the Communists threatened to come to power by peaceful means in Italy and relations generally have cooled with the Soviet Union in the last few months. So le- let me ask you first, what do you do about such cases as Italy? And secondly, does this general drift mean that were moving back toward something like an old cold  cold-war relationship with the Soviet Union?",1976-10-06,Moderator
Mr. Ford,"I dont believe we should move to a cold-war relationship. I think its in the best interest of the United States, and the world as a whole that the United States negotiate rather than go back to the cold-war relationship with the Soviet Union. I dont uh  look at the picture as bleakly as you have indicated in your question, Mr. Trewhitt. I believe that the United States ha- had many successes in recent years, in recent months, as far as the Communist movement is concerned. We have been successful in Portugal, where a year ago it looked like there was a very great possibility that the uh  Communists would take over in Portugal. It didnt happen. We have a democracy in Portugal today. A few uh  months ago, or I should say, maybe two years ago, the Soviet Union looked like they had continued strength in the Middle East. Today, according to Prime Minister Rabin, the Soviet Union is weaker in the Middle East than they have been in many, many years. The facts are, there  the Soviet Union relationship with Egypt is uh  at a low level. The Soviet Union relationship with Syria is at a very low point. The United States today, according to Prime Minister Rabin of Israel, is a- at a peak in its uh  influence and power in the Middle East. But lets turn for a minute to the uhh  southern African operations that are now going on. The United States of America took the initiative in southern Africa. We wanted to end the bloodshed in southern Africa. We wanted to have the right of self-determination in southern Africa. We wanted to have majority rule with the full protection of the rights of the minority. We wanted to preserve human dignity in southern Africa. We have taken the initiative, and in southern Africa today the United States is trusted by the black front-line nations and black Africa. The United States is trusted by other elements in southern Africa. The United States foreign policy under this administration has been one of progress and success. And I believe that instead of talking about Soviet progress, we can talk about American successes. And may I make an observation  part of the question you asked, Mr. Trewhitt? I dont believe that its in the best interest of the United States and the NATO nations to have a Communist government in NATO. Mr. Carter has indicated he would look with sympathy to a Communist government in NATO. I think that would destroy the integrity and the strength of NATO, and I am totally opposed to it.",1976-10-06,Republican
Mr. Carter,"Well, Mr. Ford, unfortunately, has just made a statement thats not true. I have never advocated a Communist government for Italy. That would obviously be a ridiculous thing for anyone to do who wanted to be president of this country. I think that this is uh  an instance of uh  deliberate distortion, and this has occurred also in the question about defense. As a matter of fact, uh  Ive never advocated any cut of $15 billion in our defense budget. As a matter of fact, Mr. Ford has made a political football out of the defense budget. About a year ago he cut the Pentagon budget six point eight billion dollars. After he fired James Schlesinger, the political heat got so great that he added back about $3 billion. When Ronald Reagan won the Texas primary election, Mr. Ford added back another one and a half billion dollars. Immediately before the Kansas City convention, he added back another one point eight billion dollars in the defense budget. And his own uh  Office of Management and Budget testified that he had a $3 billion cut insurance added to the defense budget  defense budget under the pressure from the Pentagon. Obviously, this is another indication of trying to use the defense budget for political purposes, which hes trying to do tonight. Now, we went into south Africa late, after Great Britain, Rhodesia, the black nations had been trying to solve this problem for many, many years. We didnt go in until right before the election, similar to what was taking place in 1972, when Mr. Kissinger announced peace is at hand just before the election at that time. And we have weakened our position in NATO because the other countries in Europe supported the democ- democratic forces in Portugal long before we did; we stuck to the Portugal dictatorships much longer than other democracies did in this world.",1976-10-06,Democrat
Ms. Frederick,"Mr. Valeriani, a question for Governor Carter.",1976-10-06,Moderator
Mr. Valeriani,"Governor Carter, much of what the United States does abroad is done in the name of the national interest. What is your concept of the national interest? What should the role of the United States in the world be? And in that connection, considering your limited experience in foreign affairs, and the fact that you take same pride in being a Washington outsider, dont you think it would be appropriate for you to tell the American voters before the election the people that you would like to have in key positions, such as Secretary of State, Secretary of Defense, national security affairs advisor at the White House?",1976-10-06,Moderator
Mr. Carter,"Well, Im not gonna name my cabinet before I get elected. Ive got a little ways to go before I start doing that. But I have uh  an adequate background, I believe. I am a graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy, the first military graduate since uh  Eisenhower. Ive served as the Governor of Georgia and have traveled extensively in foreign countries and South America, Central America, Europe, the Middle East and in Japan. Ive traveled the last twenty-one months among the people of this country. Ive talked to them and Ive listened. And Ive seen at first hand, in a very vivid way, the deep hurt thats come to this country in the aftermath of Vietnam and Cambodia, Chile, and Pakistan, and Angola, and Watergate, CIA revelations. What we were formerly so proud of  the strength of our country, its uh  moral integrity, the representation in foreign affairs of what our people are, what our Constitution stands for, has been gone. And in the secrecy that has surrounded our foreign policy in the last few years, uh  the American people, the Congress have been excluded. I believe I know what this country ought to be. Ive uh  been one whos loved my nation as many Americans do, and I believe that theres no limit placed on what we can be in the future, if we can harness the tremendous resources  militarily, economically, and the stature of our people, the meaning of the Constitution, in the future. Every time weve made a serious mistake in foreign affairs, its been because the American people have been excluded from the process. If we can just tap the intelligence and ability, the sound common sense and the good judgment of the American people, we can once again have a foreign policy to make us proud instead of ashamed. And Im not gonna exclude the American people from that process in the future, as Mr. Ford and Kissinger have done. This is what it takes to have a sound foreign policy strong at home, strong defense, permanent commitments, not betray the principles of our country, and involve the American people and the Congress in the shaping of our foreign policy. Every time Mr. Ford speaks from a position of secrecy in negotiations, in secret  in secret treaties thatve been uh  pursued and achieved, in supporting dictatorships, in ignoring human rights, we are weak and the rest of the world knows it. So these are the ways that we can restore the strength of our country, and they dont require long experience in foreign policy. Nobody has that except a president who has served a long time or a secretary of state. But my background, my experience, my knowledge of the people of this country, my commitment to our principles that dont change  those are the best bases to correct the horrible mistakes of this administration and restore our own country to a position of leadership in the world.",1976-10-06,Democrat
Mr. Valeriani,"How specifically, uh  Governor, are you going to bring the American people into the decision-making process in foreign policy? What does that mean?",1976-10-06,Moderator
Mr. Carter,"First of all, I would quit conducting the decision-making process in secret, as has been a characteristic of Mr. Kissinger and Mr. Ford. In many instances weve made agreements, like in Vietnam, uh  that have uh  been revealed later on to our uh  embarrassment. Recently Ian Smith, the uh  president of uh  Rhodesia, announced that he had unequivocal commitments from Mr. Kissinger that he could not reveal. The American people dont know what those commitments are. Weve seen uh  in the past the destruction of elected governments, like in Chile, and the strong support of military dictatorship there. These kinds of things have hurt us very much. I would restore the concept of the fireside chat, which was an integral part of the administration of Franklin Roosevelt. And I would also restore the involvement of the Congress. When Harry Truman was president he was not afraid to have a strong secretary of defense. Dean Acheson, George Marshall were strong secretaries of uh  state  excuse me  state. But he also made sure that there was a bipartisan support. The members of Congress, Arthur Vandenberg, Walter George, were part of the process, and before our nation made a secret agreement, or before we made a bluffing statement, we were sure that we had the backing not only of the president and the secretary of state, but also of the Congress and the people. This is a responsibility of the president. And I think its very damaging to our country for Mr. Ford to have turned over this responsibility to the secretary of state.",1976-10-06,Democrat

Mr. Ford,"Governor Carter again contradicts himself. He complains about secrecy and yet he is quoted as saying that in the attempt to find a solution in the Middle East that he would hold unpublicized meetings with the Soviet Union  I presume for the purpose of an  imposing a settlement on Israel and the Arab nations. But let me talk just a minute about what weve done to avoid secrecy in the Ford administration. After the United States took the initiative in working with Israel and with Egypt and achieving the Sinai II agreement  and Im proud to say that not a single Egyptian or Israeli soldier has lost his life since the signing of the Sinai agreement. But at the time that uh  I submitted the Sinai agreement to the Congress of the United States, I submitted every single document that was applicable to the Sinai II agreement. It was the most complete documentation by any president of any agreement signed by a president on behalf of the United States. Now as far as meeting with the Congress is concerned, during the twenty-four months that Ive been the president of the United States I have averaged better than one meeting a month with responsible groups or committees of the Congress  both House and Senate. The secretary of state has appeared in the several years that hes been the secretary before eighty different uh  committee hearings in the House and in the Senate. The secretary of state has made better than fifty speeches all over the United States explaining American foreign policy. I have made myself at least ten uh  speeches in various parts of the country where I have discussed with the American people defense and foreign policy.",1976-10-06,Republican
Ms. Frederick,"Mr. Frankel, a question for President Ford.",1976-10-06,Moderator
Mr. Frankel,"Mr. President, Id like to explore a little more deeply our relationship with the Russians. They used to brag back in Khrushchevs day that because of their greater patience and because of our greed for  for business deals that they would sooner or later get the better of us. Is it possible that despite some setbacks in the Middle East, theyve proved their point? Our allies in France and Italy are now flirting with Communism. Weve recognized the permanent Communist regime in East Germany. Weve virtually signed, in Helsinki, an agreement that the Russians have dominance in Eastern Europe. Weve bailed out Soviet agriculture with our huge grain sales. Weve given them large loans, access to our best technology and if the Senate hadnt interfered with the Jackson Amendment, maybe we  you wouldve given them even larger loans. Is that what you call a two-way street of traffic in Europe?",1976-10-06,Moderator
Mr. Ford,"I believe that we have uh  negotiated with the Soviet Union since Ive been president from a position of strength. And let me cite several examples. Shortly after I became president in uh  December of 1974, I met with uh  General Secretary Brezhnev in Vladivostok and we agreed to a mutual cap on the ballistic missile launchers at a ceiling of twenty-four hundred  which means that the Soviet Union, if that becomes a permanent agreement, will have to make a reduction in their launchers that they now have or plan to have. Ive negotiated at Vladivostok with uh  Mr. Brezhnev a limitation on the MIRVing of their ballistic missiles at a figure of thirteen-twenty, which is the first time that any president has achieved a cap either on launchers or on MIRVs. It seems to me that we can go from there to uh  the uh  grain sales. The grain sales have been a benefit to American agriculture. We have achieved a five and three quarter year uh  sale of a minimum six million metric tons, which means that they have already bought about four million metric tons this year and are bound to buy another two million metric tons to take the grain and corn and wheat that the American farmers have produced in order to uh  have full production. And these grain sales to the Soviet Union have helped us tremendously in meeting the costs of the additional oil and  the oil that we have bought from overseas. If we turn to Helsinki  Im glad you raised it, Mr. uh  Frankel. In the case of Helsinki, thirty-five nations signed an agreement, including the secretary of state for the Vatican  I cant under any circumstances believe that the  His Holiness, the Pope would agree by signing that agreement that the thirty-five nations have turned over to the Warsaw Pact nations the domination of the  Eastern Europe. It just isnt true. And if Mr. Carter alleges that His Holiness by signing that has done it, he is totally inaccurate. Now, what has been accomplished by the Helsinki agreement? Number one, we have an agreement where they notify us and we notify them of any uh  military maneuvers that are to be be undertaken. They have done it. In both cases where theyve done so, there is no Soviet domination of Eastern Europe and there never will be under a Ford administration.",1976-10-06,Republican

Mr. Ford,"I dont believe, uh  Mr. Frankel that uh  the Yugoslavians consider themselves dominated by the Soviet Union. I dont believe that the Rumanians consider themselves dominated by the Soviet Union. I dont believe that the Poles consider themselves dominated by the Soviet Union. Each of those countries is independent, autonomous: it has its own territorial integrity and the United States does not concede that those countries are under the domination of the Soviet Union.

Ms. Frederick,"Governor Carter, may I have your response?",1976-10-06,Moderator
Mr. Carter,"(chuckle) Well, in the first place, Im not criticizing His Holiness the Pope. I was talking about Mr. Ford. The uh  fact is that secrecy has surrounded the decisions made by the Ford administration. In the case of the Helsinki agreement  it may have been a good agreement at the beginning, but we have failed to enforce the so-called basket three part, which insures the right of people to migrate, to join their families, to be free, to speak out. The Soviet Union is still jamming Radio Free Europe  Radio  uh- uh  Radio Free Europe is being jammed. Weve also seen a very serious uh  problem with the so-called Sonnenfeldt document, which apparently Mr. Ford has just endorsed, which said that theres an organic linkage between the Eastern European countries and the Soviet Union. And I would like to see Mr. Ford convince the Polish-Americans and the Czech-Americans and the Hungarian-Americans in this country that those countries dont live under the domination and supervision of the Soviet Union behind the Iron  uh  Curtain. We also have seen Mr. Ford exclude himself from access to the public. He hasnt had a tough cross-examination-type press conference in over thirty days. One press conference he had without sound. Hes also shown a weakness in yielding to pressure. The Soviet Union, for instance, put pressure on Mr. Ford and he refused to see a symbol of human freedom recognized around the world, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn. The Arabs have put pressure on Mr. Ford, and hes yielded, and has permitted a boycott by the Arab countries of American businesses who trade with Israel, or who have American Jews owning or taking part in the management of American  companies. His own secretary of commerce had to be subpoenaed by the Congress to reveal the names of businesses who were subject to this boycott. They didnt volunteer the information. He had to be subpoenaed. And the last thing Id like to say is this: This grain deal with the Soviet Union in 72 was terrible, and Mr. Ford made up for it with three embargoes, one against our own ally in Japan. Thats not the way to run our foreign policy, including international trade.",1976-10-06,Democrat
Ms. Frederic,"Mr. Trewhitt, a question for Governor Carter.",1976-10-06,Moderator
Mr. Trewhitt,"Governor, Id like to pick up on that point, actually, and on your appeal for a greater measure of American idealism in foreign affairs. Foreign affairs come home to the American public pretty much in such issues as oil embargoes and grain sales, that sort of thing. Would you be willing to  to risk an oil embargo in order to promote human rights in Iran and Saudi Arabia, withhold arms from Saudi Arabia for the same purpose? Uh  or uh  I think you  matter of fact, youve perhaps answered this final part, but would you withhold grain from the Soviet Union in order to promote civil rights in the  in the Serviette Union?",1976-10-06,Moderator
Mr. Carter,"I would never single out food as a trade embargo item. If I ever decided to impose an embargo because of a crisis in international relationships, it would include all shipments of all equipment. For instance, if the Arab countries ever again declare an embargo against our nation on oil I would consider that not a military but an economic declaration of war, and I would respond instantly and in kind. I would not ship that Arab country anything  no weapons, no spare parts for weapons, no oil-drilling rigs, no oil pipe, no nothing. I wouldnt single out just food. Another thing that Id like to say is this: In our international trade, as I said in my op- opening statement, we have become the arms merchant of the world. When this Republican administration came into office we were shipping about $1 billion worth of arms overseas, now ten to twelve billion dollars worth of arms overseas to countries that quite often use these weapons to fight each other. The shift in emphasis has been very disturbing to me, speaking about the Middle East. Under the last Democratic administration 60 percent of all weapons that went into the Middle East were for Israel. Nowadays  75 percent were for Israel before. Now 60 percent go to the Arab countries, and this does not include Iran. If you include Iran, our present shipment of weapons to the Middle East, only 20 percent goes to Israel. This is a deviation from idealism; its a deviation from a commitment to our major ally in the Middle East, which is Israel; its a yielding to economic pressure on the part of the Arabs on the oil issue; and its also a tremendous indication that under the Ford administration we have not addressed the energy policy adequately. We still have no comprehensive energy policy in this country. And its an overall sign of weakness. When we are weak at home economically  high unemployment, high inflation, a confused government, a wasteful defense establishment, this encourages the kind of pressure thats been put on us successfully. It wouldve been inconceivable ten  fifteen years ago, for us to be brought to our knees with an Arab oil embargo. But it was done three years ago and theyre still putting pressure on us from the Arab countries to our discredit around the world. These are the weaknesses that I see, and I believe its not just a matter of idealism. Its a matter of being tough. Its a matter of being strong. Its a matter of being consistent. Our priorities ought to be first of all to meet our own military needs, secondly to meet the needs of our allies and friends, and only then should we ship military equipment to foreign countries. As a matter of fact, Iran is gonna get eighty F-14s before we even meet our own Air Force orders for F-l4s. And the shipment of Spruance-class destroyers to Iran are much more highly sophisticated than the Spruance-class destroyers that are present being delivered to our own Navy. This is ridiculous and it ought to be changed.",1976-10-06,Democrat
Mr. Trewhitt,"Governor, let me pursue that if I may. If I understand you correctly you would in fact to use my examples, withhold arms from Iran and Saudi Arabia even if the risk was an oil embargo and if they should be securing those arms from somewhere else, and then if the embargo came, then youd respond in kind. Do I have it correctly?",1976-10-06,Moderator
Mr. Carter,"If  Iran is not an Arab country, as you know, it is a Moslem country  but if Saudi Arabia should declare an oil embargo against us, then I would consider that an economic declaration of war. And I would make sure that the uh  Saudis understood this ahead of time so there would be no doubt in their mind. I think under those circumstances they would refrain from pushing us to our knees as they did in 1973 with their previous oil embargo.",1976-10-06,Democrat
Ms. Frederick,President Ford?,1976-10-06,Moderator
Mr. Ford,"Governor Carter uh  apparently doesnt realize that since Ive been president we have sold to the Israelis over $4 billion in military hardware. We have made available to the Israelis over 45 percent of the total economic and military aid since the establishment of Israel twenty-seven years ago. So the Ford administration has done a good job in helping our good ally, Israel, and were dedicated to the survival and security of Israel. I believe that Governor Carter doesnt realize the need and necessity for arms sales to Iran. He indicates he would not make those. Iran is bordered very extensively by the Soviet Union. Iran has Iraq as one of its neighbors. The Soviet Union and the Communist-dominated government of Iraq are neighbors of Iran, and Iran is an ally of the United States. Its my strong feeling that we ought to sell arms to Iran for its own national security, and as an ally  a strong ally of the United States. The history of our relationship with Iran goes back to the days of President Truman when he decided that it was vitally necessary for our own security as well as that of Iran, that we should help that country, and Iran has been a good ally. In 1973 when there was an oil embargo, Iran did not participate. Iran continued to sell oil to the United States. I believe that its in our interest and in the interest of Israel and Iran, and Saudi Arabia, for the United States to sell arms to those countries.

And that means establishing at some point full diplomatic relations and obviously doing something about the mutual defense treaty with Taiwan.

And, as a corollary, would you provide mainland China with military equipment if the Chinese were to ask for it?",1976-10-06,Moderator
Mr. Ford,"Our relationship with the Peoples Republic of China is based upon the Shanghai Communique, of 1972, and that communique, calls for the normalization of relations between the United States and the Peoples Republic. It doesnt set a times schedule. It doesnt uh  make a determination as to how uh  that relationship should be achieved in relationship to our current uhh  diplomatic recognition and obligations to the Taiwanese Government. The Shanghai Communique, does say that the differences between the Peoples Republic on the one hand and Taiwan on the other shall be settled by peaceful means. The net result is this administration, and during my time as the president for the next four years, we will continue to move for normalization of relations in the traditional sense, and we will insist that the disputes between Taiwan and the Peoples Republic be settled peacefully, as was agreed in the Shanghai Communique, of 1972. The Ford administration will not let down, will not eliminate or forget our obligation to the people of Taiwan.

As a matter of fact, during this current year uh we are shipping Iran, or have contracted to ship to Iran, about seven and a half billion dollars worth of arms and also to Saudi Arabia, about seven and a half billion dollars worth of arms. Also in 1975, we almost brought Israel to their knees after the uh  Yom Kippur War by the so-called reassessment of our relationship to Israel. We in effect tried to make Israel the scapegoat for the problems in the Middle East. And this weakened our relationships with Israel a great deal and put a cloud on the total commitment that our people feel toward the Israelis. There ought to be a clear, unequivocal commitment without change to Israel. In the Far East I think we need to continue to be uh  strong and uh  I would certainly uh  pursue the uh  normalization of uh  relationships with the Peoples Republic of China. We opened a great opportunity in l972, which has pretty well been frittered  frit- frittered away under Mr. Ford, that ought to be a constant uh  inclination toward  uh  toward friendship.

Mr. Frankel,"Governor, we always seem in our elections, and maybe in between too, to argue about uh  who can be tougher in the world. Give or take a  a few billion dollars, give or take one weapons systems, our leading politicians, and I think you, too, gentlemen, seem to settle roughly on the same strategy in the world at roughly the same Pentagon budget cost. How bad do things have to get in our own economy, or how much backwardness and hunger would it take in the world to persuade you that our national security and our survival required very drastic cutbacks in arms spending and dramatic new efforts in other directions?",1976-10-06,Moderator
Mr. Carter,"Well, always in the past weve had an ability to have a strong defense and also have  to have a strong uh  domestic economy, and also to be strong in our reputation and influence within the community of nations. These uh  characteristics of our country have been endangered under Mr. Ford. Were no longer respected in a showdown vote in the United Nations or in  in any other international council were lucky to get 20 percent of the other nations to vote with us. Our allies feel that weve neglected them. The so-called Nixon shock against Japan had weakened our relationships there. Under this administration weve also had an inclination to keep separate the European countries, thinking that if they are separate, then we can dominate them and proceed with our secret, Lone Ranger-type diplomatic efforts. I would uh  also like to point out that we, in this country, have let our economy go down the drain. The worst inflation since the Great Depression. The highest unemployment of any developed nation of the world. We have a higher unemployment rate in this country than Great Britain, and West Germany. Our unemployment rate is twice as high as it is in Italy; its three or four times as high as it is  as it is in Japan. And that terrible circumstance in this country is exported overseas. We comprise about 30 percent of the worlds economic trade power influence. And when were weak at home  weaker than all our allies  that weakness weakens the whole free world. So strong economy is very important. Another thing that we need to do is to reestablish the good relationships that we ought to have between the United States and our natural allies and friends. They have felt neglected. And using that base of strength, and using the idealism, the honesty, the predictability, the commitment, the integrity of our own country, thats where our strength lies. And that would permit us to deal with the developing nations in a position of strength. Under this administration weve had a continuation of the so-called balance of power politics, where everything is looked on as a struggle between us on the one side, the Soviet Union on the other. Our allies  the smaller countries get trampled in the rush. What we need is to try to seek individualized bilateral relationships with countries, regardless of their size, and to establish world-order politics, which means that we want to preserve peace through strength. We also wanna revert back to the stature and the respect that our country had in previous administrations. Now, I cant say when this can come. But I can guarantee it will not come if Gerald Ford is reelected and this present policy is continued; it will come if Im elected.",1976-10-06,Democrat

Mr. Carter,"Well let me say very quickly that under President Johnson, in spite of the massive investment in the Vietnam War, he turned over a balanced budget to Mr. Nixon. The unemployment rate was less than 4 percent. The inflation rate under Kennedy and Johnson was about 2 percent  one-third what it is under this administration. So we did have at that time with good management, the ability to do both. I dont think that anybody can say that Johnson and Kennedy neglected the poor and the destitute people in this country or around the world. But I can say this: The number one responsibility of any president, above all else, is to guarantee the security of our nation  an ability to be free of the threat of attack, or blackmail and to carry out our obligations to our allies and friends, and to carry out a legitimate foreign policy. They must go hand in hand, but the security of this nation has got to come first.",1976-10-06,Democrat

In 1975 he wanted to cut the budget $15 billion. Hes now down to a figure of five to seven billion dollars. Reductions of that kind will not permit the United States to be strong enough to deter aggression and maintain the peace. Governor Carter apparently doesnt know the facts. As soon as I became president, I initiated a meeting with the NATO heads of state and met with them in Brussels to discuss how we could improve the re- defense relationship in Western Europe. In uh  November of 1975 I met with the leaders of the five industrial nations in France for the purpose of seeing what we could do acting together to meet the problems of uh  the coming recession. In Puerto Rico this year, I met with six of the leading industrial nations heads of state to meet the problem of inflation so we would be able to solve it before it got out of hand. I have met with the heads of government bilaterally as well as multilaterally. Our relations with Japan have never been better. I was the first United States president to visit Japan.

Mr. Trewhitt,"Mr. President, uh  you referred earlier to your meeting with Mr. Brezhnev at Vladivostok in 1974. At  you agreed on that occasion to try to achieve another strategic arms limitation  SALT  agreement, ah  within the year. Ah  nothing happened in l975, or not very much publicly at least. And those talks are still dragging and things got quieter as the current season approached. Is there  is there a bit of politics involved there, perhaps on both sides? Or perhaps more important are interim weapons developments  and Im thinking of such things as the cruise missile and the Soviet SS-20, an intermediate-range rocket  making SALT irrelevant, bypassing the SALT negotiations?",1976-10-06,Moderator
Mr. Ford,"First we have to understand that SALT I expires October third 1977. Uh  Mr. Brezhnev and I met in Vladivostok in December of 1974 for the purpose of trying to take the initial step so we could have a SALT II agreement that would go to l985. As I indicated earlier, we did agree on a twenty-four-hundred limitation on uh  uh  launchers of ballistic missiles. Uh  that would mean a cutback in the Soviet program; it would not interfere with our own program. At the same time, we put a limitation of thirteen hundred and twenty on MIRVs. Our technicians have been working since that time in Geneva, trying to put into technical language a  an agreement that can be verified by both parties. In the meantime, there has developed the problem of the Soviet Backfire  their high-performance aircraft which they say is not a long-range aircraft and which some of our people say is a intercontinental aircraft. In the interim, there has been the development on our part primarily, the cruise missiles; cruise missiles that could be launched from land-based mobile installations; cruise missiles that could be launched  launched from high-performance aircraft, like the B-52s or the B-1s, which I hope we proceed with; cruise missiles which could be launched from either surface or submarine uh  naval vessels. Those gray-area weapons systems are creating some problems in a  the agreement for a SALT II negotiation. But I can say that I am dedicated to proceeding, and I met just last week with the foreign minister of the Soviet Union, and he indicated to me that uh  the Soviet Union was interested in narrowing the differences and making a realistic and a sound compromise. I hope and trust, in the best interest of both countries, and in the best interests of all people throughout this globe, that the Soviet Union and the United States can make a mutually beneficial agreement. Because if we do not and SALT I expires on October three, 1977, you will unleash again an all-out nuclear arms race with the potential of a nuclear holocaust of unbelievable dimensions. So its the obligation of the president to do just that, and I intend to do so.",1976-10-06,Republican
Mr. Trewhitt,"Mr. President, let me follow that up by  Ill submit that the cruise missile adds a  a whole new dimension to the  to the arms competition  and then cite a statement by your office to the Arms Control Association a few days ago in which you said the cruise missile might eventually be included in a comprehensive arms limitation agreement but that in the meantime it was an essential of the American strategic arsenal. Now, uh  may I assume that from that youre tending to exclude the cruise missile from the next SALT agreement, or is it still negotiable in that context?",1976-10-06,Moderator
Mr. Ford,"I believe that the cruise missiles which we are now developing in research and development across the spectrum from air, from the sea, or from the land, uh  can be uh  included within a SALT II agreement. They are a new weapons system that has a great potential, both conventional and nuclear armed. At the same time, we have to make certain that the Soviet Unions Backfire, which they claim is not an intercontinental aircraft and which some of our people contend is, must also be included if we are to get the kind of agreement which is in the best interest of both countries. And I really believe that it  its far better for us and for the Soviet Union, and more importantly for the people around the world, that these two superpowers find an answer for a SALT II agreement before October three, 1977. I think good will on both parts, hard bargaining by both parties and a reasonable compromise will be in the best interests of all parties.",1976-10-06,Republican

Mr. Carter,"Well, Mr. Ford acts like hes uh  running for president for the first time. Hes been in office two years, and there has been absolutely no progress made toward a new SALT agreement. He has learned the date of the expiration of SALT I, apparently. Weve seen, in this world, a development of a tremendous threat to us. As a nuclear engineer myself, I know the limitations and capabilities of atomic power. I also  know that as far as the human beings on this earth are concerned that the nonproliferation of atomic weapons is number one. Only the last few days with the election approaching, has Mr. Ford taken any interest in a nonproliferation movement. I advocated last May in a speech at the United Nations that we move immediately as a nation to declare a complete moratorium on the testing of all nuclear devices, both weapons and peaceful devices; that we not ship any more atomic fuel to a country that refuses to comply with strict controls over the waste which can be reprocessed into explosives. Ive also advocated that we stop the sale by Germany and France of  processing plants for Pakistan and Brazil. Mr. Ford hasnt moved on this. We also need to provide an adequate supply of enriched uranium. Mr. Ford, again, under pressure from the atomic energy lobby, has insisted that this reprocessing or rather re-en- enrichment be done by private industry and not by the existing uh  government uh  plants. This kind of confusion and absence of leadership has let us drift now for two years with a constantly increasing threat of atomic weapons throughout the world. We now have five nations that have atomic bombs that we know about. If we continue under Mr. Fords policy by 1985 or 90 well have twenty nations that have the capability of exploding atomic weapons. This has got to be stopped. That is one of the major challenges and major undertakings that I will assume as the next president.",1976-10-06,Democrat
Ms. Frederick,"Mr. Valeriani, a question for Governor Carter.",1976-10-06,Moderator
Mr. Valeriani,"Governor Carter, earlier tonight you said America is not strong any more; America is not respected any more. And I feel that I must ask you: Do you really believe that the United States is not the strongest country in the world, do you really believe that the United States is not the most respected country in the world? Or is that just campaign rhetoric?",1976-10-06,Moderator
Mr. Carter,"No, its not just campaign rhetoric. I think that militarily we are as strong as any nation on earth. I think we got to stay that way and continue to increase our capabilities to meet any potential threat. But as far as strength derived from commitment to principles, as far as strength derived from the unity within our country, as far as strength derived from the people, the Congress, the secretary of state, the president, sharing in the evolution and carrying-out of a foreign policy, as far as strength derived from the respect of our own allies and friends, their assurance that we will be staunch in our commitment, that we will not deviate and that well give them adequate attention, as far as  as strength derived from doing whats right  caring for the poor, providing food, becoming the breadbasket of the world instead of the arms merchant of the world  in those respects, were not strong. Also, well never be strong again overseas, unless were strong at home. And with our economy in such terrible disarray and getting worse by the month. Weve got five-hundred thousand more Americans unemployed today than we had three months ago. Weve got two and a half million more Americans out of work now than we had when Mr. Ford took office. This kind of deterioration in our economic strength is bound to weaken us around the world. And we not only have uh problems at home but we export those problems overseas. So as far as the respect of our own people toward our own government, as far as participating in the shaping of uh  concepts and commitments, as far as the trust of our country among the nations of the world, as far as dependence of our country in meeting the needs and obligations that weve expressed to our allies, as far as the respect of our country  even among our potential adversaries  we are weak. Potentially were strong. Under this administration that strength has not been realized.",1976-10-06,Democrat
Ms. Frederick,President Ford.,1976-10-06,Moderator
Mr. Ford,"Governor Carter uh  brags about the unemployment during Democratic administrations and condemns the unemployment at the present time. I must remind him that were at peace and during the period that he brags about unemployment being low, the United States was at war. Now let me correct one other comment that uh  Governor Carter has made. I have recommended to the Congress that we develop the uranium enrichment plant at Portsmouth, Ohio, which is a publicly owned  U.S. government facility and have indicated that the private program which would follow on in Alabama is one that may or may not uhh  be constructed. But I am committed to the one at Portsmouth, Ohio. The governor also talks about morality in foreign policy. The foreign policy of the United States meets the highest standards of morality. What is more moral than peace, and the United States is at peace today? What is more moral in foreign policy than for the administration to take the lead in the World Food Conference in Rome in 1974 when the United States committed six million metric tons of food  over 60 percent of the food committed for the disadvantaged and underdeveloped nations of the world? The Ford administration wants to eradicate hunger and disease in our underdeveloped countries throughout the world. What is more moral than for the United States under the Ford administration to take the lead in southern Africa, in the Middle East? Those are initiatives in foreign policy which are of the highest moral standard and that is indicative of the foreign policy of this country.",1976-10-06,Republican
Ms. Frederick,"Mr. Frankel, a question for President Ford.",1976-10-06,Moderator
Mr. Frankel,"Mr. President, can we stick with morality? Uh  for a lot of people it seems to cover uh  a bunch of sins. Uh  Mr. Nixon and Mr. Kissinger used to tell us that instead of morality we had to worry in the  in the world about living and letting live all kinds of governments that we really dont like. North and South Korean dictators, Chilean fascists, uh  Chinese Communists, Iranian emperors and so on. They said the only way to get by in a wicked world was to treat others on the basis of how they treated us and not how they treated their own people. But more recently, uhh  we seemed tove taken a different tack. Uhh  weve seemed to have decided that it  that it is part of our business to tell the Rhodesians, for instance, that the way theyre treating their own black people is wrong and theyve got to change their government and weve put pressure an them. We were rather liberal in our advice to the Italians as to how to vote. Umm  is this a new Ford foreign policy in the making? Can we expect that you are now going to turn to South Africa and force them to change their governments, to intervene in similar ways to end the bloodshed, as you called it, say, in Chile or Chilean prisons, and throw our weight around for the  for the values that  that we hold dear in the world?",1976-10-06,Moderator
Mr. Ford,"I believe that uh  our foreign policy must express the highest standards of morality. And the initiatives that we took in southern Africa are the best examples of what this administration is doing and will continue to do in the next four years. If the United States had not moved when we did in southern Africa, theres no doubt there would have been an acceleration of bloodshed in that tragic part of the world. If we had not taken our initiative, its very, very possible that uh  the government of Rhodesia would have been overrun and that the Soviet Union and the Cubans would have dominated uh  southern Africa. So the United States, seeking to preserve the principle of self-determination, to eliminate the possibility of bloodshed, to protect the rights of the minority as we insisted upon the rights of the majority, uh  I believe followed the good conscience of the American people in foreign policy. And I believe that we used our skill. Secretary of State Kissinger has done a superb job in working with the black African nations, the so-called front-line nations. He has done a superb job in getting the prime minister of South Africa, Mr. Vorster, to agree that the time had come for a solution to the problem of Rhodesia. Secretary Kissinger, in his meeting with uh  Prime Minister Smith of Rhodesia, was able to convince him that it was in the best interests of whites as well as blacks in Rhodesia to find an answer for a transitional government and then a majority government. This is a perfect example of the kind of leadership that the United States, under this administration, has taken. And I can assure you that this administration will follow that high moral principle in our future efforts in foreign policy, including our efforts in the Middle East where it is vitally important because the Middle East is the crossroads of the world. Thereve been more disputes in its area where theres more volatility than any other place in the world. But because Arab nations and the Israelis trust the United States, we were able to take the lead in the Sinai II Agreement. And I can assure you that the United States will have the leadership role in moving toward a comprehensive settlement of the Middle Eastern problems, I hope and trust as soon as possible. And we will do it with the highest moral principles.",1976-10-06,Republican
Mr. Frankel,"Mr. President, just clarify one paint: There are lots of majorities in the world that feel theyre being pushed around by minority governments. And are you saying they can now expect to look to us for not just good cheer but throwing our weight on their side  in South Africa, or on Taiwan, or in Chile, uh  to help change their governments, as in Rhodesia?",1976-10-06,Moderator
Mr. Ford,"I would hope that as we move to one area of the world from another  and the United States must not spread itself too thinly  that was one of the problems that helped to create the circumstances in Vietnam  but as we as a nation find that we are asked by the various parties, either one nation against another or individuals within a nation, that the United States will take the leadership and try to resolve the differences. Let me take uh  South Korea as an example. I have personally told President Pack that the United States does not condone the kind of repressive measures that he has taken in that country. But I think in all fairness and equity we have to recognize the problem that South Korea has. On the north they have North Korea with five hundred thousand well-trained, well-equipped troops  they are supported by the Peoples Republic of China; they are supported by the Soviet Union. South Korea faces a very delicate situation. Now the United States, in this case, this administration, has recommended a year ago and we have reiterated it again this year, that the United States, South Korea, North Korea and the uh  Peoples Republic of China sit down at a conference table to resolve the problems of the Korean peninsula. This is a leadership role that the United States under this administration is carrying out, and if we do it, and I think the opportunities and the possibilities are getting better, we will have solved many of the internal domestic problems that exist in South Korea at the present time.",1976-10-06,Republican
Ms. Frederick,Governor Carter.,1976-10-06,Moderator
Mr. Carter,"I notice that Mr. Ford didnt comment on the uh  prisons in Chile. This is an  a typical example, maybe of many others, where this administration overthrew an elected government and helped to establish a military dictatorship. This has not been an ancient history story. Last year under Mr. Ford, of all the Food for Peace that went to South America, 85 percent went to the military dictatorship in Chile. Another point I wanna make is this. He says we have to move from one area of the world to another. Thats one of the problems with this administrations so-called shuttle diplomacy. While the secretary of states in one country, there are almost a hundred and fifty others that are wondering what were gonna do next, what will be the next secret agreement. We dont have a comprehensive understandable foreign policy that deals with world problems or even regional problems. Another thing that concerned me was what Mr. Ford said about unemployment, that  insinuating that under Johnson and Kennedy that unemployment could only be held down when this country is at war. Karl Marx said that the free enterprise system in a democracy can only continue to exist when they are at war or preparing far war. Karl Marx was the grandfather of Communism. I dont agree with that statement. I hope Mr. Ford doesnt either. He has put pressure on the Congress  and I dont believe Mr. Ford would even deny this  to hold up on nonproliferation legislation until the Congress agreed for an $8 billion program for private industry to start producing enriched uranium. And the last thing I wanna make is this. He talks about peace and Im thankful for peace. We were peaceful when Mr. Ford went into office. But he and Mr. Kissinger and others tried to start a new Vietnam in Angola, and it was only the outcry of the American people and the Congress when their secret deal was discovered that prevented our involvement in that conflagration which was taking place there.",1976-10-06,Democrat

Mr. Trewhitt, a question for Governor Carter.",1976-10-06,Moderator
Mr. Trewhitt,"Governor Carter, before this event the most communications I received concerned Panama. Is  would you as president be prepared to sign a treaty which at a fixed date yielded administrative and economic control of the Canal Zone and shared defense, which, as I understand it, is the position the United States took in 1974?",1976-10-06,Moderator
Mr. Carter,"Well, here again, uh  the Panamanian question is one thats been confused by Mr. Ford. Uh  he had directed his uh  diplomatic relation  uh  uh  representative to yield to the Panamanians full sovereignty over the Panama Canal Zone at the end of a certain period of time. When Mr. Reagan raised this uh  question in Florida uh  Mr. Ford not only disavowed his instructions, but he also even dropped, parenthetically, the use of the word detente. I would never give up complete control or practical control of the Panama Canal Zone, but I would continue to negotiate with the Panamanians. When the original treaty was signed back in the early 1900s, when Theodore Roosevelt was president, Panama retained sovereignty over the Panama Canal Zone. We retained control as though we had sovereignty. Now I would be willing to go ahead with negotiations. I believe that we could share more fully responsibilities for the Panama Canal Zone with Panama. I would be willing to continue to raise the payment for shipment of goods through the Panama Canal Zone. I might even be willing to reduce to some degree our military emplacements in the Panama Canal Zane, but I would not relinquish practical control of the Panama Canal Zane any time in the foreseeable future.",1976-10-06,Democrat

Mr. Ford,"The United States must and will maintain complete access to the Panama Canal. The United States must maintain a defense capability of the Panama Canal. And the United States will maintain our national security interest in the Panama Canal. The negotiations far the Panama Canal started under President Johnson and have continued up to the present time. I believe those negotiations should continue. But there are certain guidelines that must be followed, and Ive just defined them. Let me take just a minute to comment on something that Governor Carter said. On non  nu- oh  uh  nonproliferation, in May of l975, I called for a conference of uh  nuclear suppliers. That conference has met six times. In May of this year, Governor Carter took the first initiative, approximately twelve months after I had taken my initiative a year ago.",1976-10-06,Republican
Ms. Frederick,"Mr. Valeriani, a question for President Ford.",1976-10-06,Moderator
Mr. Valeriani,"Mr. President, the Government Accounting Office has just put out a report suggesting that you shot from the hip in the Mayaguez rescue mission and that you ignored diplomatic messages saying that a peaceful solution was in prospect. Uh  why didnt you do more diplomatically at the time; and a related question: Did the White House try to prevent the release of that report?",1976-10-06,Moderator
Mr. Ford,"The White House did not uh  prevent the release of that report. On July twelfth of this year, we gave full permission for the release of that report. I was very disappointed in the fact that the uh  GAO released that report because I think it interjected political partisan politics at the present time. But let me comment on the report. Somebody who sits in Washington, D.C., eighteen months after the Mayaguez incident, can be a very good grandstand quarterback. And let me make another observation. This morning, I got a call from the skipper of the Mayaguez. He was furious because he told me that it was the action of me, President Ford, that saved the lives of the crew of the Mayaguez. And I can assure you that if we had not taken the strong and forceful action that we did, we would have been uh  criticized very, very uh  severely for sitting back and not moving. Captain Miller is thankful. The crew is thankful. We did the right thing. It seems to me that those who sit in Washington eighteen months after the incident are not the best judges of the decision-making process that had to be made by the National Security Council and by myself at the time the incident was developing in the Pacific. Let me assure you that we made every possible overture to the Peoples Republic of China and through them to the Cambodian Government. We made uh  diplomatic uh  protests to the Cambodian government through the United Nations. Every possible diplomatic means was utilized. But at the same time, I had a responsibility, and so did the National Security Coun- Council, to meet the problem at hand. And we handled it responsibly and I think Captain Millers testimony to that effect is the best evidence.",1976-10-06,Republican
Ms. Frederick,Governor Carter.,1976-10-06,Moderator
Mr. Carter,"Well, Im reluctant to uh comment on the recent report  I havent read it. I think the American people have only one  uh requirement  that the facts about Mayaguez be given to them accurately and completely. Mr. Ford has been there for eighteen months. He had the facts that were released today immediately after the Mayaguez incident. I understand that the report today is accurate. Mr. Ford has said, I believe, that it was accurate, and that the White House made no attempt to block the issuing of that report. I dont know if thats exactly accurate or not. I understand that both the  the uh  Department of State and the Defense Department have approved the accuracy of todays report, or yesterdays report, and also the National Security Agency. I dont know what was right, or what was wrong, or what was done. The only thing I believe is that whatever the  the knowledge was that Mr. Ford had should have been given to the American people eighteen months ago, immediately after the Mayaguez uh  incident occurred. This is uh  what the American people want. When something happens that endangers our security, or when something happens that threatens our stature in the world, or when American people are endangered by the actions of a foreign country, uh  just forty uh sailors on the Mayaguez, we obviously have to move aggressively and quickly to rescue them. But then after the immediate action is taken, I believe the president has an obligation to tell the American people the truth and not wait eighteen months later for the report to be issued.",1976-10-06,Democrat

Mr. Frankel,"Governor Carter, if the price of uh  gaining influence among the Arabs is closing our eyes a little bit to their boycott against Israel, how would you handle that?",1976-10-06,Moderator
Mr. Carter,"I believe that the boycott of American businesses by the Arab countries because those businesses trade with Israel or because they have American Jews who are owners or directors in the company is an absolute disgrace. This is the first time that Ive  remember in the history of our country when weve let a foreign country circumvent or change our Bill of Rights. Ill do everything I can as president to stop the boycott of American businesses by the Arab countries. Its not a matter of diplomacy or trade with me. Its a matter of morality. And I dont believe that Arab countries will pursue it when we have a strong president who will protect the integrity of our country, the commitment of our Constitution and Bill of Rights and protect people in this country who happen to be Jews. It may later be Catholics; it may be  later be Baptists who are threatened by some foreign country. But we ought to stand staunch. And I think its a disgrace that so far Mr. Fords administration has blocked the passage of legislation that wouldve revealed by law every instance of the boycott and it wouldve prevented the boycott from continuing.",1976-10-06,Democrat
Ms. Frederick,President Ford.,1976-10-06,Moderator
Mr. Ford,"Again Governor Carter is inaccurate. The Arab boycott action was first taken in 1952. And in November of 1975 I was the first president to order the executive branch to take action, affirmative action, through the Department of Commerce and other cabinet departments, to make certain that no American businessman or business organization should discriminate against Jews because of an Arab boycott. And I might add that uh  my administration  and Im very proud of it  is the first administration that has taken an antitrust action against companies in this country that have allegedly cooperated with the Arab boycott. Just on Monday of this week I signed a tax bill that included an amendment that would prevent companies in the United States from taking a tax deduction if they have in any way whatsoever cooperated with the Arab boycott. And last week when we were trying to get the Export Administration Act through the Congress  necessary legislation  my administration went to Capitol Hill and tried to convince the House and the Senate that we should have an amendment on that legislation which would take strong and effective action against those who uh  participate or cooperate with the Arab uh boycott. One other point. Because the Congress failed to act, I am going to announce tomorrow that the Department of Commerce will disclose those companies that have uh  participated in the Arab boycott. This is something that we can do; the Congress failed to do it, and we intend to do it.",1976-10-06,Republican

Mr. Ford,"Let me restate uh  our policy. As long as Vietnam, North Vietnam, does not give us a full and complete accounting of our missing in action, I will never uh  go along with the admission of Vietnam to the United Nations. If they do give us a bona fide, complete uh  accounting of the eight hundred MIAs, then I believe that the United States should begin negotiations for the uh  admission of Vietnam to the United Nations.

This is what the families of MIAs want. So far, Mr. Ford has not done it. Weve had several fragmentary efforts by members of the Congress and by  by private citizens. Several months ago the Vietnam government said, We are ready to sit down and negotiate for release of information on MIAs. So far, Mr. Ford has not responded. I would never normalize relationships with Vietnam, nor permit them to join the United Nations until theyve taken this action. But thats not enough. We need to have an active and aggressive action on the part of the president, the leader of his country, to seek out every possible way to get that information which has kept the MIA families in despair and doubt, and Mr. Ford has just not done it.",1976-10-06,Democrat

Mr. Carter,"The purpose of this debate and the outcome of the election will determine three basic things: Leadership, upholding the principles of our country, and proper priorities and commitments for the future. This election will also determine what kind of world we leave our children. Will it be a nightmare world threatened with the proliferation of atomic bombs, not just in five major countries but dozens of smaller countries that have been permitted to develop atomic weapons because of a failure of our top leadership to stop proliferation? Will we have a world of hunger and  and hatred, and will we be living in an armed camp stripped of our friendship and allies hiding behind a tight defense thats been drawn in around us because we are fearful of the outside world? Will we have a government of secrecy that excludes the American people from participation in making basic decisions and therefore covers up mistakes and makes it possible for our government  our government  to depart from the principles of our Constitution and Bill of Rights? Or will we have a world of peace with the threat of atomic weapons eliminated, with full trade, with our people at work, inflation controlled, openness in government, our people proud once again, Congress, citizens, president, secretary of state working in harmony and unity toward a common future? Or world where people have enough to eat and a world where we care about those who dont? Can we become a breadbasket of the world instead of the arms merchant of the world? I believe we can and we ought to. Now weve been hurt in recent years in this country. In the aftermath of Vietnam, Cambodia, Chile, Pakistan, Angola, Watergate, CIA, weve been hurt. Our people feel that weve lost something precious. Thats not necessary. I wanna see our nation  return to a posture and an image and a standard to make us proud once again. I remember the world with NATO, and the world of Point Four, and the world of the Marshall Plan, and the world of the Peace Corps. Why cant we have that once again? We ought to be a beacon for nations who search for peace and who search for freedom, who search for individual liberty, who search for basic human rights. We havent been lately. We can be once again. Well never have that world leadership until we are strong at home, and we can have that strength if we return to the basic principles. It ought not to be a strength of bombast and threats.

Ms. Walters,"Thank you, Dorothy. A few words as we begin tonights debate about the format. The position of the candidates  that is, who answers questions first and who gives the last statement  was determined by a toss of a coin between the two candidates. Mr. Mondale won, and that means that he chose to give the final closing statement. It means, too, that the President will answer the first question first. I hope thats clear. If it isnt, it will become clear as the debate goes on. Further, the candidates will be addressed as they each wanted and will, therefore, be called Mr. President and Mr. Mondale. Since there will also be a second debate between the two Presidential candidates, tonight will focus primarily on the economy and other domestic issues. The debate, itself, is built around questions from the panel. In each of its segments, a reporter will ask the candidates the same general question. Then  and this is important  each candidate will have the chance to rebut what the other has said. And the final segment of the debate will be the closing segment, and the candidates will each have 4 minutes for their closing statements. And as I have said, Mr. Mondale will be the last person on the program to speak. And now I would like to add a personal note if I may. As Dorothy Ridings pointed out, I have been involved now in four Presidential debates, either as a moderator or as a panelist. In the past, there was no problem in selecting panelists. Tonight, however, there were to have been four panelists participating in this debate. The candidates were given a list of almost 100 qualified journalists from all the media and could agree on only these three fine journalists. As moderator, and on behalf of my fellow journalists, I very much regret, as does the League of Women Voters, that this situation has occurred.

Mr. Wieghart,"Mr. President, in 1980 you promised the American people  in your campaign  a balanced budget by 1983. Weve now had more and bigger deficits in the 4 years youve been in office. Mr. President, do you have a secret plan to balance the budget sometime in a second term, and if so, would you lay out that plan for us tonight? The President. I have a plan  not a secret plan. As a matter of fact, it is the economic recovery program that we presented when I took office in 1981. It is true that earlier, working with some very prominent economists, I had come up, during the campaign, with an economic program that I thought could rectify the great problems confronting us  the double-digit inflation, the high tax rates that I think were hurting the economy, the stagflation that we were undergoing. Before even the election day, something that none of those economists had even predicted had happened, that the economy was so worsened that I was openly saying that what we had thought on the basis of our plan could have brought a balanced budget  no, that was no longer possible. So, the plan that we have had and that we are following is a plan that is based on growth in the economy, recovery without inflation, and reducing the share that the Government is taking from the gross national product, which has become a drag on the economy. Already, we have a recovery that has been going on for about 21 months to the point that we can now call it an expansion. Under that, this year, we have seen a $21 billion reduction in the deficit from last year, based mainly on the increased revenues the Government is getting without raising tax rates. Our tax cut, we think, was very instrumental in bringing about this economic recovery. We have reduced inflation to about a third of what it was. The interest rates have come down about 9 or 10 points and, we think, must come down further. In the last 21 months, more than 6 million people have gotten jobs  there have been created new jobs for those people to where there are now 105 million civilians working, where there were only 99 million before; 107, if you count the military. So, we believe that as we continue to reduce the level of government spending  the increase, rate of increase in government spending, which has come down from 17 to 6 percent, and, at the same time, as the growth in the economy increases the revenues the Government gets, without raising taxes, those two lines will meet. And when they meet, that is a balanced budget.",1984-10-07,Moderator
Mr. Wieghart,"Mr. President, the Congressional Budget Office has some bad news. The lines arent about to meet, according to their projections. They project that the budget deficit will continue to climb. In the year 1989 they project a budget deficit of $273 billion. The President. The deficit is the result of excessive government spending. I do not, very frankly, take seriously the Congressional Budget Office projections, because they have been wrong on virtually all of them, including the fact that our recovery wasnt going to take place to begin with. But it has taken place. But, as I said, we have the rate of increase in government spending down to 6 percent. If the rate of increase in government spending can be held at 5 percent  were not far from there  by 1989 that would have reduced the budget deficits down to a $30 or $40 billion level. At the same time, if we can have a 4-percent recovery continue through that same period of time, that will mean  without an increase in tax rates  that will mean $400 billion more in government revenues. And so, I think that the lines can meet. Actually, in constant dollars, in the domestic side of the budget, there has been no spending increase in the 4 years that we have been here.",1984-10-07,Moderator
Mr. Wieghart,"Mr. Mondale, the Carter-Mondale administration didnt come close to balancing the budget in its 4 years in office either, despite the fact that President Carter did promise a balanced budget during his term.",1984-10-07,Moderator
Mr. Mondale,"One of the key tests of leadership is whether one sees clearly the nature of the problems confronted by our nation. And perhaps the dominant domestic issue of our times is what do we do about these enormous deficits. I respect the President; I respect the Presidency, and I think he knows that. But the fact of it is, every estimate by this administration about the size of the deficit has been off by billions and billions of dollars. As a matter of fact, over 4 years, theyve missed the mark by nearly $600 billion. We were told we would have a balanced budget in 1983. It was $200 billion deficit instead. And now we have a major question facing the American people as to whether well deal with this deficit and get it down for the sake of a healthy recovery. Virtually every economic analysis that Ive heard of, including the distinguished Congressional Budget Office, which is respected by, I think, almost everyone, says that even with historically high levels of economic growth, we will suffer a $263 billion deficit. In other words, it doesnt converge as the President suggests. It gets larger even with growth. What that means is that we will continue to have devastating problems with foreign trade. This is the worst trade year in American history by far. Our rural and farm friends will have continued devastation. Real interest rates  the real cost of interest  will remain very, very high, and many economists are predicting that were moving into a period of very slow growth because the economy is tapering off and may be a recession. I get it down to a level below 2 percent of gross national product with a policy thats fair. Ive stood up and told the American people that I think its a real problem, that it can destroy long-term economic growth, and Ive told you what I think should be done. I think this is a test of leadership, and I think the American people know the difference.",1984-10-07,Democrat
Mr. Wieghart,"Mr. Mondale, one other way to attack the deficit is further reductions in spending. The President has submitted a number of proposals to Congress to do just that, and in many instances the House, controlled by the Democrats, has opposed them. Isnt it one aspect of leadership for prominent Democrats such as yourself to encourage responsible reductions in spending, and thereby reduce the deficit?",1984-10-07,Moderator
Mr. Mondale,"Absolutely, and I proposed over a hundred billion dollars in cuts in Federal spending over 4 years, but I am not going to cut it out of Social Security and Medicare and student assistance and things  [applause]  that people need. These people depend upon all of us for the little security that they have, and Im not going to do it that way. The rate of defense spending increase can be slowed. Certainly we can find a coffeepot that costs something less than $7,000. And there are other ways of squeezing this budget without constantly picking on our senior citizens and the most vulnerable in American life. And thats why the Congress, including the Republicans, have not gone along with the Presidents recommendations.",1984-10-07,Democrat
Ms. Walters,"I would like to ask the audience please to refrain from applauding either side; it just takes away from the time for your candidates. And now it is time for the rebuttal. Mr. President, 1 minute for rebuttal.",1984-10-07,Moderator
Reagan,"Yes. I dont believe that Mr. Mondale has a plan for balancing the budget; he has a plan for raising taxes. And, as a matter of fact, the biggest single tax increase in our nations history took place 1977. And for the 5 years previous to our taking office, taxes doubled in the United States, and the budgets increased $318 billion. So, there is no ratio between taxing and balancing a budget. Whether you borrow the money or whether you simply tax it away from the people, youre taking the same amount of money out of the private sector, unless and until you bring down governments share of what it is taking. With regard to Social Security, I hope therell be more time than just this minute to mention that, but I will say this: A President should never say never. But Im going to violate that rule and say never. I will never stand for a reduction of the Social Security benefits to the people that are now getting them.",1984-10-07,Republican
Ms. Walters,Mr. Mondale?,1984-10-07,Moderator
Mr. Mondale,"Well, thats exactly the commitment that was made to the American people in 1980: He would never reduce benefits. And of course, what happened right after the election is they proposed to cut Social Security benefits by 25 percent  reducing the adjustment for inflation, cutting out minimum benefits for the poorest on Social Security, removing educational benefits for dependents whose widows were trying  with widows trying to get them through college. Everybody remembers that; people know what happened. Theres a difference. I have fought for Social Security and Medicare and for things to help people who are vulnerable all my life, and I will do it as President of the United States.",1984-10-07,Democrat
Ms. Walters,"Thank you very much. Well now begin with segment number two with my colleague, Diane Sawyer.",1984-10-07,Moderator
Ms. Sawyer,"Mr. President, Mr. Mondale, the public opinion polls do suggest that the American people are most concerned about the personal leadership characteristics of the two candidates, and each of you has questioned the others leadership ability. Mr. President, you have said that Mr. Mondales leadership would take the country down the path of defeatism and despair, and Vice President Bush has called him whining and hoping for bad news. And, Mr. Mondale, you have said that President Reagan offers showmanship, not leadership, that he has not mastered what he must know to command his government. Id like to ask each of you to substantiate your claims  Mr. Mondale first. Give us specifics to support your claim that President Reagan is a showman, not a leader; has not mastered what he must know to be President after 4 years, and then, second, tell us what personal leadership characteristics you have that he does not.",1984-10-07,Moderator
Mr. Mondale,"Well, first of all, I think the first answer this evening suggests exactly what Im saying. There is no question that we face this massive deficit, and almost everybody agrees unless we get it down, the chances for long-term, healthy growth are nil. And its also unfair to dump these tremendous bills on our children. The President says it will disappear overnight because of some reason. No one else believes thats the case. I do, and Im standing up to the issue with an answer thats fair. I think thats what leadership is all about. Theres a difference between being a quarterback and a cheerleader, and when theres a real problem, a President must confront it. What I was referring to, of course, in the comment that you referred to was the situation in Lebanon. Now, for three occasions, one after another, our Embassies were assaulted in the same way by a truck with demolitions. The first time  and I did not criticize the President, because these things can happen  once, and sometimes twice  the second time the barracks in Lebanon were assaulted, as we all remember. There was two or three commission reports, recommendations by the CIA, the State Department, and the others, and the third time there was even a warning from the terrorists themselves. Now, I believe that a President must command that White House and those who work for him. Its the toughest job on Earth, and you must master the facts and insist that things that must be done are done. I believe that the way in which I will approach the Presidency is whats needed, because all my life that has been the way in which I have sought to lead. And thats why in this campaign Im telling you exactly what I want to do. I am answering your questions. I am trying to provide leadership now, before the election, so that the American people can participate in that decision.",1984-10-07,Democrat
Ms. Sawyer,"You have said, Mr. Mondale, that the polls have given you lower ratings on leadership than President Reagan because your message has failed to get through. Given that you have been in public office for so many years, what accounts for the failure of your message to get through?",1984-10-07,Moderator
Mr. Mondale,"Well, I think were getting better all the time. And I think tonight, as we contrast for the first time our differing approach to government, to values, to the leadership in this country, I think as this debate goes forward, the American people will have for the first time a chance to weigh the two of us against each other. And I think, as a part of that process, what I am trying to say will come across, and that is that we must lead, we must command, we must direct, and a President must see it like it is. He must stand for the values of decency that the American people stand for, and he must use the power of the White House to try to control these nuclear weapons and lead this world toward a safer world.",1984-10-07,Democrat
Ms. Sawyer,"Mr. President, the issue is leadership in personal terms. First, do you think, as Vice President Bush said, that Mr. Mondales campaign is one of whining and hoping for bad news? And second, what leadership characteristics do you possess that Mr. Mondale does not?",1984-10-07,Moderator
Reagan,"Well, whether he does or not, let me suggest my own idea about the leadership factor, since youve asked it. And, incidentally, I might say that with regard to the 25-percent cut in Social Security  before I get to the answer to your question  the only 25-percent cut that I know of was accompanying that huge 1977 tax increase, was a cut of 25 percent in the benefits for every American who was born after 1916. Now, leadership. First of all, I think you must have some principles you believe in. In mine, I happen to believe in the people and believe that the people are supposed to be dominant in our society  that they, not government, are to have control of their own affairs to the greatest extent possible, with an orderly society. Now, having that, I think also that in leadership  well, I believe that you find people, positions such as Im in who have the talent and ability to do the things that are needed in the various departments of government. I dont believe that a leader should be spending his time in the Oval Office deciding whos going to play tennis on the White House court. And you let those people go with the guidelines of overall policy, not looking over their shoulder and nitpicking the manner in which they go at the job. You are ultimately responsible, however, for that job. But I also believe something else about that. I believe that  and when I became Governor of California, I started this, and I continue it in this office  that any issue that comes before me, I have instructed Cabinet members and staff they are not to bring up any of the political ramifications that might surround the issue. I dont want to hear them. I want to hear only arguments as to whether it is good or bad for the people  is it morally right? And on that basis and that basis alone, we make a decision on every issue. Now, with regard to my feeling about why I thought that his record bespoke his possible taking us back to the same things that we knew under the previous administration, his record is that he spoke in praise of deficits several times, said they werent to be abhorred  that, as a matter of fact, he at one time said he wished the deficit could be doubled, because they stimulate the economy and helped reduce unemployment.",1984-10-07,Republican
Ms. Sawyer,"As a followup, let me draw in another specific, if I could  a specific that the Democrats have claimed about your campaign  that it is essentially based on imagery. And one specific that they allege is that, for instance, recently you showed up at the opening ceremony of a Buffalo old-age housing project, when in fact, your policy was to cut Federal housing subsidies for the elderly. Yet you were there to have your picture taken with them.",1984-10-07,Moderator
Reagan,"Our policy was not to cut subsidies. We have believed in partnership, and that was an example of a partnership between, not only local government and the Federal Government but also between the private sector that built that particular structure. And this is what weve been trying to do, is involve the Federal Government in such partnerships. We are today subsidizing housing for more than 10 million people, and were going to continue along that line. We have no thought of throwing people out into the snow, whether because of age or need. We have preserved the safety net for the people with true need in this country, and it has been pure demagoguery that we have in some way shut off all the charitable programs or many of them for the people who have real need. The safety net is there, and were taking care of more people than has ever been taken care of before by any administration in this country.",1984-10-07,Republican
Ms. Walters,"Mr. Mondale, an opportunity for you to rebut.",1984-10-07,Moderator
Mr. Mondale,"Well, I guess Im reminded a little bit of what Will Rogers once said about Hoover. He said, Its not what he doesnt know that bothers me; its what he knows for sure that just aint so. [Laughter] The fact of it is: The Presidents budget sought to cut Social Security by 25 percent. Its not an opinion; its a fact. And when the President was asked the other day, What do you want to cut in the budget?, he said, Cut those things I asked for but didnt get. Thats Social Security and Medicare. The second fact is that the housing unit for senior citizens that the President dedicated in Buffalo was only made possible through a Federal assistance program for senior citizens that the Presidents budget sought to terminate. So, if hed had his way, there wouldnt have been any housing project there at all. This administration has taken a meat cleaver out, in terms of Federal-assisted housing, and the record is there. We have to see the facts before we can draw conclusions.",1984-10-07,Democrat
Ms. Walters,Mr. President?,1984-10-07,Moderator
Reagan,"Well, let me just respond with regard to Social Security. When we took office, we discovered that the program that the Carter-Mondale administration had said would solve the fiscal problems of Social Security for the next 50 years wouldnt solve them for 5. Social Security was due to go bankrupt before 1983. Any proposals that I made at that time were at the request of the chairman, a Democrat, of one of the leading committees, who said we have to do something before the program goes broke and the checks bounce. And so, we made a proposal. And then in 1982, they used that proposal in a demagogic fashion for the 1982 campaign. And 3 days after the election in 1982, they came to us and said, Social Security, we know, is broke. Indeed, we had to borrow $17 billion to pay the checks. And then I asked for a bipartisan commission, which Id asked for from the beginning, to sit down and work out a solution. And so, the whole matter of what to do with Social Security has been resolved by bipartisan legislation, and it is on a sound basis now for as far as you can see into the next century.",1984-10-07,Republican
Ms. Walters,"Mr. President, we begin segment number three with Fred Barnes.",1984-10-07,Moderator
Mr. Barnes,"Mr. President, would you describe your religious beliefs, noting particularly whether you consider yourself a born-again Christian, and explain how these beliefs affect your Presidential decisions?",1984-10-07,Moderator
Reagan,"Well, I was raised to have a faith and a belief and have been a member of a church since I was a small boy. In our particular church, we did not use that term, born again, so I dont know whether I would fit that  that particular term. But I have  thanks to my mother, God rest her soul  the firmest possible belief and faith in God. And I dont believe  I believe, I should say, as Lincoln once said, that I could not  I would be the most stupid man in the world if I thought I could confront the duties of the office I hold if I could not turn to someone who was stronger and greater than all others. And I do resort to prayer. At the same time, however, I have not believed that prayer should be introduced into an election or be a part of a political campaign  or religion a part of that campaign. As a matter of fact, I think religion became a part of this campaign when Mr. Mondales running mate said I wasnt a good Christian. So, it does play a part in my life. I have no hesitancy in saying so. And, as I say, I dont believe that I could carry on unless I had a belief in a higher authority and a belief that prayers are answered.",1984-10-07,Republican
Mr. Barnes,"Given those beliefs, Mr. President, why dont you attend services regularly, either by going to church or by inviting a minister to the White House, as President Nixon used to do, or someone to Camp David, as President Carter used to do?",1984-10-07,Moderator
Reagan,"The answer to your question is very simple about why I dont go to church. I have gone to church regularly all my life, and I started to here in Washington. And now, in the position I hold and in the world in which we live, where Embassies do get blown up in Beirut  were supposed to talk about that on the debate the 21st, I understand  but I pose a threat to several hundred people if I go to church.",1984-10-07,Republican
Ms. Walters,"May I ask you, please  [applause]  may I ask the audience please to refrain from applause. Fred, your second question.",1984-10-07,Moderator
Mr. Barnes,"Mr. Mondale, would you describe your religious beliefs and mention whether you consider yourself a born-again Christian, and explain how those beliefs would affect your decisions as President?",1984-10-07,Moderator
Mr. Mondale,"First of all, I accept President Reagans affirmation of faith. Im sure that we all accept and admire his commitment to his faith, and we are strengthened, all of us, by that fact. I am a son of a Methodist minister. My wife is the daughter of a Presbyterian minister. And I dont know if Ive been born again, but I know I was born into a Christian family. And I believe I have sung at more weddings and more funerals than anybody ever to seek the Presidency. Whether that helps or not, I dont know. I have a deep religious faith. Our family does. It is fundamental. Its probably the reason that Im in politics. I think our faith tells us, instructs us, about the moral life that we should lead. And I think were all together on that. What bothers me is this growing tendency to try to use ones own personal interpretation of faith politically, to question others faith, and to try to use the instrumentalities of government to impose those views on others. All history tells us that thats a mistake. When the Republican platform says that from here on out, were going to have a religious test for judges before theyre selected for the Federal court, and then Jerry Falwell announces that that means they get at least two Justices of the Supreme Court, I think thats an abuse of faith in our country. This nation is the most religious nation on Earth  more people go to church and synagogues than any other nation on Earth  and its because we kept the politicians and the state out of the personal exercise of our faith. Thats why faith in the United States is pure and unpolluted by the intervention of politicians. And I think if we want to continue  as I do  to have a religious nation, lets keep that line and never cross it.",1984-10-07,Democrat

Mr. Barnes,"Yes, Mr. Mondale, youve complained, just now, about Jerry Falwell, and youve complained other times about other fundamentalists in politics. Correct me if Im wrong, but I dont recall your ever complaining about ministers who are involved in the civil rights movement or in the anti-Vietnam war demonstrations or about black preachers whove been so involved in American politics. Is it only conservative ministers that you object to?",1984-10-07,Moderator
Mr. Mondale,"No. What I object to  [applause]  what I object to  what I object to is someone seeking to use his faith to question the faith of another or to use that faith and seek to use the power of government to impose it on others. A minister who is in civil rights or in the conservative movement, because he believes his faith instructs him to do that, I admire. The fact that the faith speaks to us and that we are moral people, hopefully, I accept and rejoice in. Its when you try to use that to undermine the integrity of private political  or private religious faith and the use of the state is where  for the most personal decisions in American life  thats where I draw the line.",1984-10-07,Democrat
Ms. Walters,"Thank you. Now, Mr. President, rebuttal.",1984-10-07,Moderator
Reagan,"Yes, its very difficult to rebut, because I find myself in so much agreement with Mr. Mondale. I, too, want that wall that is in the Constitution of separation of church and state to remain there. The only attacks I have made are on people who apparently would break away at that wall from the government side, using the government, using the power of the courts and so forth to hinder that part of the Constitution that says the government shall not only not establish a religion, it shall not inhibit the practice of religion. And they have been using these things to have government, through court orders, inhibit the practice of religion. A child wants to say grace in a school cafeteria and a court rules that they cant do it because its school property. These are they types of things that I think have been happening in a kind of a secular way that have been eroding that separation, and I am opposed to that. With regard to a platform on the Supreme Court, I can only say one thing about that. I have appointed one member to the Supreme Court: Sandra Day OConnor. Ill stand on my record on that. And if I have the opportunity to appoint any more, Ill do it in the same manner that I did in selecting her.",1984-10-07,Republican

Mr. Mondale,"The platform to which the President refers, in fact, calls for a religious test in the selection of judges. And Jerry Falwell says that means we get two or three judges. And it would involve a religious test for the first time in American life.

We dont want that.",1984-10-07,Democrat

Mr. Wieghart,"After that discussion, this may be like going from the sublime to the ridiculous, but here goes. I have a political question for you, Mr. Mondale. [Laughter] Polls indicate a massive change in the electorate, away from the coalition that has long made the Democratic Party a majority. Blue-collar workers, young professionals, their children, and much of the middle class now regard themselves as Independents or Republican instead of Democrats, and the gap  the edge the Democrats had in party registration seems to be narrowing.",1984-10-07,Moderator
Mr. Mondale,"My answer is that this campaign isnt over yet. And when people vote, I think youre going to see a very strong verdict by the American people that they favor the approach that Im talking about. The American people want arms control. They dont want this arms race. And they dont want this deadly new effort to bring weapons into the heavens. And they want an American foreign policy that leads toward a safer world. The American people see this debt, and they know its got to come down. And if it wont come down, the economys going to slow down, maybe go into a recession. They see this tremendous influx and swamping of cheap foreign imports in this country that has cost over 3 million jobs, given farmers the worst year in American history. And they know this debt must come down as well, because its unfair to our children. The American people want this environment protected. They know that these toxic waste dumps should have been cleaned up a long time ago, and they know that peoples lives and health are being risked, because weve had an administration that has been totally insensitive to the law and the demand for the protection of the environment. The American people want their children educated. They want to get our edge back in science, and they want a policy headed by the President that helps close this gap thats widening between the United States and Europe and Japan. The American people want to keep opening doors. They want those civil rights laws enforced. They want the equal rights amendment ratified. They want equal pay for comparable effort for women. And they want it because theyve understood from the beginning that when we open doors, were all stronger, just as we were at the Olympics. I think as you make the case, the American people will increasingly come to our cause.",1984-10-07,Democrat

I think the American people will draw their own conclusions. Secondly, Ive said that I will not support the cuts in Social Security and Medicare and the rest that the President has proposed. The President answers that it didnt happen or, if it did, it was resolved later in a commission. As the record develops, I think its going to become increasingly clear that what I am saying and where I want to take this country is exactly where the country wants to go, and the comparison of approaches is such that I think will lead to further strength.",1984-10-07,Democrat
Mr. Wieghart,"Mr. President, you and your party are benefiting from what appears to be an erosion of the old Democratic coalition, but you have not laid out a specific agenda to take this shift beyond November 6th. What is your program for America for the next decade, with some specificity?",1984-10-07,Moderator
Reagan,"Well, again, Im running on the record. I think sometimes Mr. Mondales running away from his. But Im running on the record of what we have asked for. Well continue to try to get things that we didnt get in a program that has already brought the rate of spending of government down from 17 percent to 6.1 percent, a program of returning authority and autonomy to the local and State governments that has been unjustly seized by the Federal Government. And you might find those words in a Democratic platform of some years ago  I know, because I was a Democrat at that time. And I left the party eventually, because I could no longer follow the turn in the Democratic leadership that took us down an entirely different path, a path of centralizing authority in the Federal Government, lacking trust in the American people. I promised, when we took office, that we would reduce inflation. We have, to one-third of what it was. I promised that we would reduce taxes. We did, 25 percent across the board. That barely held even with  if it did that much  with the gigantic tax increase imposed in 1977. But at least it took that burden away from them. I said that we would create jobs for our people, and we did  6 million in the last 20 or 21 months. I said that we would become respected in the world once again and that we would refurbish our national defense to the place that we could deal on the world scene and then seek disarmament, reduction of arms, and, hopefully, an elimination of nuclear weapons. We have done that. All of the things that I said we would do, from inflation being down, interest rates being down, unemployment falling, all of those things we have done. And I think this is something the American people see. I think they also know that we had a commission that came in a year ago with a recommendation on education  on excellence in education. And today, without the Federal Government being involved other than passing on to them, the school districts, the words from that commission, we find 35 States with task forces now dealing with their educational problems. We find that schools are extending the curriculum to now have forced teaching of mathematics and science and so forth. All of these things have brought an improvement in the college entrance exams for the first time in some 20 years. So, I think that many Democrats are seeing the same thing this Democrat saw: The leadership isnt taking us where we want to go.",1984-10-07,Republican
Mr. Wieghart,"Mr. President, much of what you said affects the quality of life of many Americans  their income, the way they live, and so forth  but theres an aspect to quality of life that lies beyond the private sector which has to do with our neighborhoods, our cities, our streets, our parks, our environment. In those areas, I have difficulty seeing what your program is and what you feel the Federal responsibility is in these areas of the quality of life in the public sector that affects everybody, and even enormous wealth by one individual cant create the kind of environment that he might like.",1984-10-07,Moderator
Reagan,"There are tasks that government legitimately should enforce and tasks that government performs well, and youve named some of them. Crime has come down the last 2 years, for the first time in many, many decades that it has come down  or since weve kept records  2 consecutive years, and last year it came down the biggest drop in crime that weve had. I think that weve had something to do with that, just as we have with the drug problem nationwide. The environment? Yes, I feel as strongly as anyone about the preservation of the environment. When we took office, we found that the national parks were so dirty and contained so many hazards, lack of safety features, that we stopped buying additional park land until we had rectified this with what was to be a 5-year program  but its just about finished already  a billion dollars. And now were going back to budgeting for additional lands for our parks. We have added millions of acres to the wilderness lands, to the game refuges.

Now, maybe we made a wrong turn with Kennedy, but Ill be proud of supporting him all of my life.

The President just said that his government is shrinking. Its not. Its now the largest peacetime government ever in terms of the take from the total economy.

And so, my change had come earlier than that. I hadnt gotten around to reregistering as yet. I found that was rather difficult to do. But I finally did it. There are some other things that have been said here  back, and you said that I might be able to dredge them up. Mr. Mondale referred to the farmers worst year. The farmers are not the victims of anything this administration has done. The farmers were the victims of the double-digit inflation and the 21\1/2\-percent interest rates of the Carter-Mondale administration and the grain embargo, which destroyed our reliability nationwide as a supplier. All of these things are presently being rectified, and I think that we are going to salvage the farmers. As a matter of fact, there has been less than one-quarter of 1 percent of foreclosures of the 270,000 loans from government that the farmers have.",1984-10-07,Republican
Ms. Walters,"Thank you, Mr. President. Well now turn to Diane Sawyer for her round of questions.",1984-10-07,Moderator
Ms. Sawyer,"Id like to turn to an area that I think few people enjoy discussing, but that we probably should tonight because the positions of the two candidates are so clearly different and lead to very different policy consequences  and that is abortion and right to life. Im exploring for your personal views of abortion and specifically how you would want them applied as public policy.",1984-10-07,Moderator
Reagan,"I have believed that in the appointment of judges that all that was specified in the party platform was that they respect the sanctity of human life. Now, that I would want to see in any judge and with regard to any issue having to do with human life. But with regard to abortion, and I have a feeling that this is  theres been some reference without naming it here in the remarks of Mr. Mondale tied to injecting religion into government. With me, abortion is not a problem of religion, its a problem of the Constitution. I believe that until and unless someone can establish that the unborn child is not a living human being, then that child is already protected by the Constitution, which guarantees life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness to all of us. And I think that this is what we should concentrate on, is trying  I know there were weeks and weeks of testimony before a Senate committee, there were medical authorities, there were religious  there were clerics there  everyone talking about this matter of prolife. And at the end of all of that, not one shred of evidence was introduced that the unborn child was not alive. We have seen premature births that are now grown-up, happy people going around. Also, there is a strange dichotomy in this whole position about our courts ruling that abortion is not the taking of a human life. In California, sometime ago, a man beat a woman so savagely that her unborn child was born dead with a fractured skull, and the California State Legislature unanimously passed a law that was signed by the then-Democratic Governor  signed a law that said that any man who so abuses a pregnant woman that he causes the death of her unborn child shall be charged with murder. Now, isnt it strange that that same woman could have taken the life of her unborn child, and it was abortion and not murder, but if somebody else does it, thats murder? And it used the term death of the unborn child. So, this has been my feeling about abortion, that we have a problem now to determine  and all the evidence so far comes down on the side of the unborn child being a living human being.",1984-10-07,Republican
Ms. Sawyer,"A two-part followup. Do I take it from what youve said about the platform, then, that you dont regard the language and dont regard in your own appointments, abortion position a test of any kind for justices  that it should be? And also, if abortion is made illegal, how would you want it enforced? Who would be the policing units that would investigate? And would you want the women who have abortions to be prosecuted?",1984-10-07,Moderator
Reagan,"The laws regarding that always were State laws. It was only when the Supreme Court handed down a decision that the Federal Government intervened in what had always been a State policy. Our laws against murder are State laws. So, I would think that this would be the point of enforcement on this. As I say, I feel that we have a problem here to resolve. And no one has approached it from that matter. It does not happen that the church that I belong to had that as part of its dogma. I know that some churches do. Now, it is a sin if youre taking a human life. At the same time, in our Judeo-Christian tradition, we recognize the right of taking a human life in self-defense. And therefore, Ive always believed that a mother, if medically it is determined that her life is at risk if she goes through with the pregnancy, she has a right then to take the life of even her own unborn child in defense of her own.",1984-10-07,Republican
Ms. Sawyer,"Mr. Mondale, to turn to you, do you consider abortion a murder or a sin? And bridging from what President Reagan said, he has written that if society doesnt know whether life does  human life, in fact, does begin at conception, as long as there is a doubt, that the unborn child should at least be given the benefit of the doubt and that there should be protection for that unborn child.",1984-10-07,Moderator
Mr. Mondale,"This is one of the most emotional and difficult issues that could possibly be debated. I think your questions, however, underscore the fact there is probably no way that government should or could answer this question in every individual case and in the private lives of the American people. The constitutional amendment proposed by President Reagan would make it a crime for a woman to have an abortion if she had been raped or suffered from incest. Is it really the view of the American people, however you feel on the question of abortion, that government ought to be reaching into your livingrooms and making choices like this? I think it cannot work, wont work, and will lead to all kinds of cynical evasions of the law. Those who can afford to have them will continue to have them. The disadvantaged will go out in the back alley as they used to do. I think these questions are inherently personal and moral, and every individual instance is different. Every American should be aware of the seriousness of the step. But there are some things that government can do and some things they cannot do. Now, the example that the President cites has nothing to do with abortion. Somebody went to a woman and nearly killed her. Thats always been a serious crime and always should be a serious crime. But how does that compare with the problem of a woman who is raped? Do we really want those decisions made by judges whove been picked because they will agree to find the person guilty? I dont think so, and I think its going in exactly the wrong direction. In America, on basic moral questions we have always let the people decide in their own personal lives. We havent felt so insecure that weve reached for the club of state to have our point of view. Its been a good instinct. And were the most religious people on Earth. One final point: President Reagan, as Governor of California, signed a bill which is perhaps the most liberal proabortion bill of any State in the Union.",1984-10-07,Democrat
Ms. Sawyer,"But if I can get you back for a moment on my point, which was the question of when human life begins  a two-part followup. First of all, at what point do you believe that human life begins in the growth of a fetus? And second of all, you said that government shouldnt be involved in the decisions. Yet there are those who would say that government is involved, and the consequence of the involvement was 1.5 million abortions in 1980. And how do you feel about that?",1984-10-07,Moderator
Mr. Mondale,"The basic decision of the Supreme Court is that each person has to make this judgment in her own life, and thats the way its been done. And its a personal and private, moral judgment. I dont know the answer to when life begins. And its not that simple, either. Youve got another life involved. And if its rape, how do you draw moral judgments on that? If its incest, how do you draw moral judgments on that? Does every woman in America have to present herself before some judge picked by Jerry Falwell to clear her personal judgment? It wont work. [Applause]",1984-10-07,Democrat
Ms. Walters,"Im sorry to do this, but I really must talk to the audience. Youre all invited guests. I know Im wasting time in talking to you, but it really is very unfair of you to applaud  sometimes louder, less loud  and I ask you, as people who were invited here, and polite people, to refrain. We have our time now for rebuttal. Mr. President.",1984-10-07,Moderator
Reagan,"Yes. Well, with regard to this being a personal choice, isnt that what a murderer is insisting on, his or her right to kill someone because of whatever fault they think justifies that? Now, Im not capable, and I dont think you are, any of us, to make this determination that must be made with regard to human life. I am simply saying that I believe that thats where the effort should be directed  to make that determination. I dont think that any of us should be called upon here to stand and make a decision as to what other things might come under the self-defense tradition. That, too, would have to be worked out then, when you once recognize that were talking about a life. But in this great society of ours, wouldnt it make a lot more sense, in this gentle and kind society, if we had a program that made it possible for when incidents come along in which someone feels they must do away with that unborn child, that instead we make it available for the adoption? There are a million and a half people out there standing in line waiting to adopt children who cant have them any other way.",1984-10-07,Republican
Ms. Walters,Mr. Mondale.,1984-10-07,Moderator
Mr. Mondale,"I agree with that, and thats why I was a principal sponsor of a liberal adoption law, so that more of these children could come to term, so that the young mothers were educated, so we found an option, an alternative. Im all for that. But the question is whether this other option proposed by the President should be pursued. And I dont agree with it. Since Ive got about 20 seconds, let me just say one thing. The question of agriculture came up a minute ago. Net farm income is off 50 percent in the last 3 years, and every farmer knows it. And the effect of these economic policies is like a massive grain embargo, which has caused farm exports to drop 20 percent. Its been a big failure. I opposed the grain embargo in my administration. Im opposed to these policies as well.",1984-10-07,Democrat
Ms. Walters,"Im sitting here like the great schoolteacher, letting you both get away with things  because one did it, the other one did it. May I ask in the future that the rebuttal stick to what the rebuttal is. And also, foreign policy will be the next debate. Stop dragging it in by its ear into this one. [Laughter] Now, having admonished you, I would like to say to the panel, you are allowed one question and one followup. Would you try, as best you could, not to ask two and three  I know its something we all want to do  two and three questions as part one and two and three as part two. Having said that, Fred, its yours.",1984-10-07,Moderator
Mr. Barnes,"Thank you. Mr. Mondale, let me ask you about middle-class Americans and the taxes they pay. Now, Im talking not about the rich or the poor  I know your views on their taxes  but about families earning 25,000 to 45,000 a year. Do you think that those families are overtaxed or undertaxed by the Federal Government?",1984-10-07,Moderator
Mr. Mondale,"In my opinion, as we deal with this deficit, people from about $70,000 a year on down have to be dealt with very, very carefully, because they are the ones who didnt get any relief the first time around. Under the 1981 tax bill, people making $200,000 a year got $60,000 in tax relief over 3 years, while people making $30,000 a year, all taxes considered, got no relief at all or their taxes actually went up. Thats why my proposal protects everybody from $25,000 a year or less against any tax increases, and treats those $70,000 and under in a way that is more beneficial than the way the President proposes with a sales tax or a flat tax. What does this mean in real life? Well, the other day, Vice President Bush disclosed his tax returns to the American people. Hes one of the wealthiest Americans, and hes our Vice President. In 1981 I think he paid about 40 percent in taxes. In 1983, as a result of these tax preferences, he paid a little over 12 percent, 12.8 percent in taxes. That meant that he paid a lower percent in taxes than the janitor who cleaned up his office or the chauffeur who drives him to work. I believe we need some fairness. And thats why Ive proposed what I think is a fair and a responsible proposal that helps protect these people whove already got no relief or actually got a tax increase.",1984-10-07,Democrat
Mr. Barnes,"It sounds as if you are saying you think this group of taxpayers making 25,000 to 45,000 a year is already overtaxed, yet your tax proposal would increase their taxes. I think your aides have said those earning about 25,000 to 35,000, their tax rate would go up  their tax bill would go up a hundred dollars, and from 35,000 to 45,000, more than that, several hundred dollars. Wouldnt that stifle their incentive to work and invest and so on, and also hurt the recovery?",1984-10-07,Moderator
Mr. Mondale,"The first thing is, everybody 25,000 and under would have no tax increase. Mr. Reagan, after the election, is going to have to propose a tax increase, and you will have to compare what he proposes. And his Secretary of the Treasury said hes studying a sales tax or a value-added tax. Theyre the same thing. They hit middle- and moderate-income Americans and leave wealthy Americans largely untouched. Up until about $70,000, as you go up the ladder, my proposals will be far more beneficial. As soon as we get the economy on a sound ground as well, Id like to see the total repeal of indexing. I dont think we can do that for a few years. But at some point, we want to do that as well.",1984-10-07,Democrat
Mr. Barnes,"Mr. President, let me try this on you. Do you think middle-income Americans are overtaxed or undertaxed?",1984-10-07,Moderator
Reagan,"You know, I wasnt going to say this at all, but I cant help it. There you go again. [Laughter] I dont have a plan to tax  or increase taxes. Im not going to increase taxes. I can understand why you are, Mr. Mondale, because as a Senator you voted 16 times to increase taxes. Now, I believe that our problem has not been that anybody in our country is undertaxed; its that government is overfed. And I think that most of our people  this is why we had a 25-percent tax cut across the board which maintained the same progressivity of our tax structure in the brackets on up. And, as a matter of fact, it just so happens that in the quirks of administering these taxes, those above $50,000 actually did not get quite as big a tax cut percentage-wise as did those from 50,000 down. From 50,000 down, those people paid two-thirds of the taxes, and those people got two-thirds of the tax cut. Now, the Social Security tax of 77  this indeed was a tax that hit people in the lower brackets the hardest. It had two features. It had several tax increases phased in over a period of time  there are two more yet to come between now and 1989. At the same time every year, it increased the amount of money  virtually every year, there may have been one or two that were skipped in there  that was subject to that tax. Today it is up to about $38,000 of earnings that is subject to the payroll tax for Social Security. And that tax, there are no deductions, so a person making anywhere from 10, 15, 20  theyre paying that tax on the full gross earnings that they have after they have already paid an income tax on that same amount of money. Now, I dont think that to try and say that we were taxing the rich, and not the other way around, it just doesnt work out that way. The system is still where it was with regard to the progressivity, as Ive said, and that has not been changed. But if you take it in numbers of dollars instead of percentage, yes, you could say, well, that person got 10 times as much as this other person. Yes, but he paid 10 times as much, also. But if you take it in percentages, then you find out that it is fair and equitable across the board.",1984-10-07,Republican
Mr. Barnes,"I thought I caught, Mr. President, a glimmer of a stronger statement there in your answer than youve made before. I think the operative position you had before was that you would only raise taxes in a second term as a last resort, and I thought you said flatly that Im not going to raise taxes. Is that what you meant to say, that you will not  that you will flatly not raise taxes in your second term as President?",1984-10-07,Moderator
Reagan,"Yes, I had used  last resort would always be with me. If you got the Government down to the lowest level, that you yourself could say it could not go any lower and still perform the services for the people, and if the recovery was so complete that you knew you were getting the ultimate amount of revenues that you could get through that growth, and there was still some slight difference there between those two lines, then I had said once that, yes, you would have to then look to see if taxes should not be adjusted. I dont foresee those things happening, so I say with great confidence Im not going to go for a tax. With regard to assailing Mr. Bush about his tax problems and the difference from the tax he once paid and then the later tax he paid, I think if you looked at the deductions, there were great legal expenses in there  had to do, possibly, with the sale of his home, and they had to do with his setting up of a blind trust. All of those are legally deductions, deductible in computing your tax, and it was a 1-year thing with him.",1984-10-07,Republican
Ms. Walters,"Mr. Mondale, here we go again. Its time for rebuttal.",1984-10-07,Moderator
Mr. Mondale,"Well, first of all, I gave him the benefit of the doubt on the house deal. Im just talking about the 12.8 percent that he paid, and thats whats happening all over this country with wealthy Americans. Theyve got so many loopholes they dont have to pay much in taxes.",1984-10-07,Democrat
Reagan,Yes.,1984-10-07,Republican
Mr. Mondale,You remember the last time you said that?,1984-10-07,Democrat
Reagan,Mm-hmm.,1984-10-07,Republican
Mr. Mondale,"You said it when President Carter said that you were going to cut Medicare, and you said, Oh, no, there you go again, Mr. President. And what did you do right after the election? You went out and tried to cut $20 billion out of Medicare. And so, when you say, There you go again  people remember this, you know. [Laughter] And people will remember that you signed the biggest tax increase in the history of California and the biggest tax increase in the history of the United States, and what are you going to do? Youve got a $260 billion deficit. You cant wish it away. You wont slow defense spending; you refuse to do that",1984-10-07,Democrat
Ms. Walters,"Mr. Mondale, Im afraid your time is up.",1984-10-07,Moderator
Mr. Mondale,Sorry.,1984-10-07,Democrat
Ms. Walters,Mr. President?,1984-10-07,Moderator
Reagan,"Yes. With regard to Medicare, no, but its time for us to say that Medicare is in pretty much the same condition that Social Security was, and something is going to have to be done in the next several years to make it fiscally sound. And, no, I never proposed any $20 billion should come out of Medicare; I have proposed that the program we must treat with that particular problem. And maybe part of that problem is because during the 4 years of the Carter-Mondale administration medical costs in this country went up 87 percent.",1984-10-07,Republican
Ms. Walters,All right. Fine.,1984-10-07,Moderator
Reagan,I gave you back some of that time. [Laughter],1984-10-07,Republican
Ms. Walters,"We cant keep going back for other rebuttals; therell be time later. We now go to our final round. The way things stand now, we have time for only two sets of questions, and by lot, it will be Jim and Diane. And well start with Jim Wieghart.",1984-10-07,Moderator
Mr. Wieghart,"Mr. President, the economic recovery is real, but uneven. The Census Bureau, just a month ago, reported that there are more people living under poverty now, a million more people living under it, than when you took office. There have been a number of studies, including studies by the Urban Institute and other nonpolitical organizations, that say that the impact of the tax and budget cuts and your economic policies have impacted severely on certain classes of Americans  working mothers, head of households, minority groups, elderly poor. In fact, theyre saying the rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer under your policies.",1984-10-07,Moderator
Reagan,"Well, some of those facts and figures just dont stand up. Yes, there has been an increase in poverty, but it is a lower rate of increase than it was in the preceding years before we got here. It has begun to decline, but it is still going up. On the other hand, women heads of household  single women heads of household have  for the first time theres been a turndown in the rate of poverty for them. We have found also in our studies that in this increase in poverty, it all had to do with their private earnings. It had nothing to do with the transfer of payments from government by way of many programs. We are spending now 37 percent more on food for the hungry in all the various types of programs than was spent in 1980. Were spending a third more on all of the  well, all of the programs of human service. We have more people receiving food stamps than were ever receiving them before  2,300,000 more are receiving them  even though we took 850,000 off the food stamp rolls because they were making an income that was above anything that warranted their fellow citizens having to support them. We found people making 185 percent of the poverty level were getting government benefits. We have set a line at 130 percent so that we can direct that aid down to the truly needy. Some time ago, Mr. Mondale said something about education and college students and help of that kind. Half  one out of two of the full-time college students in the United States are receiving some form of Federal aid. But there, again, we found people that there under the previous administration, families that had no limit to income were still eligible for low-interest college loans. We didnt think that was right. And so, we have set a standard that those loans and those grants are directed to the people who otherwise could not go to college, their family incomes were so low. So, there are a host of other figures that reveal that the grant programs are greater than they have ever been, taking care of more people than they ever have. 7.7 million elderly citizens who were living in the lowest 20 percent of earnings  7.7 million have moved up into another bracket since our administration took over, leaving only 5 million of the elderly in that bracket when there had been more than 13 million.",1984-10-07,Republican
Mr. Wieghart,"Mr. President, in a visit to Texas  in Brownsville, I believe it was, in the Rio Grande Valley  you did observe that the economic recovery was uneven.",1984-10-07,Moderator
Reagan,Yes.,1984-10-07,Republican
Mr. Wieghart,"In that particular area of Texas, unemployment was over 14 percent, whereas statewide, it was the lowest in the country, I believe  5.6 percent. And you made the comment, however, that man does not live by bread alone. What did you mean by that comment? And if I interpret it correctly, it would be a comment more addressed to the affluent who obviously can look beyond just the bread they need to sustain them, with their wherewithal.",1984-10-07,Moderator
Reagan,"That had nothing to do with the other thing of talking about their needs or anything. I remember distinctly, I was segueing into another subject. I was talking about the things that have been accomplished, and that was referring to the revival of patriotism and optimism, the new spirit that were finding all over America. And it is a wonderful thing to see when you get out there among the people. So, that was the only place that that was used. I did avoid, Im afraid, in my previous answer, also, the idea of uneven, yes. There is no way that the recovery is even across the country, just as in the depths of the recession, there were some parts of the country that were worse off, but some that didnt even feel the pain of the recession. Were not going to rest and not going to be happy until every person in this country who wants a job can have one, until the recovery is complete across the country.",1984-10-07,Republican
Mr. Wieghart,"Mr. Mondale, as you can gather from the question to the President, the celebrated War on Poverty obviously didnt end the problem of poverty, although it may have dented it. The poor and the homeless and the disadvantaged are still with us. What should the Federal Governments role be to turn back the growth in the number of people living below the poverty level, which is now 35 million in the United States, and to help deal with the structural unemployment problems that the President was referring to in an uneven recovery?",1984-10-07,Moderator
Mr. Mondale,"Number one, weve got to get the debt down to get the interest rates down so the economy will grow and people will be employed. Number two, we have to work with cities and others to help generate economic growth in those communities  through the Urban Development Action Grant Program. I dont mind those enterprise zones; lets try them, but not as a substitute for the others. Certainly education and training is crucial. If these young Americans dont have the skills that make them attractive to employees, theyre not going to get jobs. The next thing is to try to get more entrepreneurship in business within the reach of minorities so that these businesses are located in the communities in which theyre found. The other thing is, we need the business community as well as government heavily involved in these communities to try to get economic growth. There is no question that the poor are worse off. I think the President genuinely believes that theyre better off. But the figures show that about 8 million more people are below the poverty line than 4 years ago. How you can cut school lunches, how you can cut student assistance, how you can cut housing, how you can cut disability benefits, how you can do all of these things and then the people receiving them  for example, the disabled, who have no alternative  how theyre going to do better, I dont know. Now, we need a tight budget, but theres no question that this administration has singled out things that affect the most vulnerable in American life, and theyre hurting. One final point if I might. Theres another part of the lopsided economy that were in today, and that is that these heavy deficits have killed exports and are swamping the Nation with cheap imports. We are now $120 billion of imports, 3 million jobs lost, and farmers are having their worst year. Thats another reason to get the deficit down.",1984-10-07,Democrat
Mr. Wieghart,"Mr. Mondale, is it possible that the vast majority of Americans who appear to be prosperous have lost interest in the kinds of programs youre discussing to help those less privileged than they are?",1984-10-07,Moderator
Mr. Mondale,"I think the American people want to make certain that that dollar is wisely spent. I think they stand for civil rights. I know theyre all for education in science and training, which I strongly support. They want these young people to have a chance to get jobs and the rest. I think the business community wants to get involved. I think theyre asking for new and creative ways to try to reach it with everyone involved. I think thats part of it. I think also that the American people want a balanced program that gives us long-term growth so that theyre not having to take money thats desperate to themselves and their families and give it to someone else. Im opposed to that, too.",1984-10-07,Democrat
Ms. Walters,And now it is time for our rebuttal for this period. Mr. President?,1984-10-07,Moderator
Reagan,"Yes. The connection thats been made again between the deficit and the interest rates  there is no connection between them. There is a connection between interest rates and inflation, but I would call to your attention that in 1981 while we were operating still on the Carter-Mondale budget that we inherited  that the interest rates came down from 21\1/2\, down toward the 12 or 13 figure. And while they were coming down, the deficits had started their great increase. They were going up. Now, if there was a connection I think that there would be a different parallel between deficits getting larger and interest rates going down. The interest rates are based on inflation. And right now I have to tell you I dont think there is any excuse for the interest rates being as high as they are because we have brought inflation down so low. I think it can only be that theyre anticipating or hope  expecting, not hoping, that maybe we dont have a control of inflation and its going to go back up again. Well, it isnt going to go back up. Were going to see that it doesnt. And I havent got time to answer with regard to the disabled.",1984-10-07,Republican
Ms. Walters,"Thank you, Mr. President.",1984-10-07,Moderator
Mr. Mondale,"Mr. President, if I heard you correctly, you said that these deficits dont have anything to do with interest rates. I will grant you that interest rates were too high in 1980, and we can have another debate as to why  energy prices and so on. Theres no way of glossing around that. But when these huge deficits went in place in 1981, whats called the real interest rates  the spread between inflation and what a loan costs you doubled  and thats still the case today. And the result is interest costs that have never been seen before in terms of real charges, and its attributable to the deficit.",1984-10-07,Democrat
Ms. Walters,"Thank you, Mr. Mondale. Youre both very obedient. I have to give you credit for that. We now start our final round of questions. We do want to have time for your rebuttal. We start with Diane  Diane Sawyer.",1984-10-07,Moderator
Ms. Sawyer,"Since we are reaching the end of the question period, and since in every Presidential campaign, the candidates tend to complain that the opposition candidate is not held accountable for what he or she says, let me give you the chance to do that.",1984-10-07,Moderator
Mr. Mondale,"Do you want to give me some suggestions? [Laughter] Im going to use my time a little differently. Im going to give the President some credit. I think the President has done some things to raise the sense of spirit, morale, good feeling in this country, and hes entitled to credit for that. What I think we need, however, is not just that but to move forward, not just congratulating ourselves but challenging ourselves to get on with the business of dealing with Americas problems. I think in education, when he lectured the country about the importance of discipline, I didnt like it at first, but I think it helped a little bit. But now we need both that kind of discipline and the resources and the consistent leadership that allows this country to catch up in education and science and training. I like President Reagan. And this is not personal  there are deep differences about our future, and thats the basis of my campaign.",1984-10-07,Democrat
Ms. Sawyer,"Follow up in a similar vein, then. What remaining question would you most like to see your opponent forced to answer?",1984-10-07,Moderator
Mr. Mondale,"Without any doubt, I have stood up and told the American people that that $263 billion deficit must come down. And Ive done what no candidate for President has ever done, I told you before the election what Id do. Mr. Reagan, as you saw tonight  President Reagan takes the position it will disappear by magic. It was once called voodoo economics. I wish the President would say: Yes, the CBO is right. Yes, we have a $263 billion deficit. This is how Im going to get it done. Dont talk about growth, because even though we need growth, thats not helping. Its going to go in the other direction, as theyve estimated. And give us a plan. What will you cut? Whose taxes will you raise? Will you finally touch that defense budget? Are you going to go after Social Security and Medicare and student assistance and the handicapped again as you did last time? If youd just tell us what youre going to do, then the American people could compare my plan for the future with your plan. And thats the way it should be. The American people would be in charge.",1984-10-07,Democrat
Ms. Sawyer,"Mr. President, the most outrageous thing your opponent has said in the debate tonight?",1984-10-07,Moderator
Reagan,"Well, now, I have to start with a smile, since his kind words to me. Ill tell you what I think has been the most outrageous thing in political dialog, both in this campaign and the one in 82. And that is the continued discussion and claim that somehow I am the villain who is going to pull the Social Security checks out from those people who are dependent on them. And why I think it is outrageous  first of all, it isnt true. But why it is outrageous is because, for political advantage, every time they do that, they scare millions of senior citizens who are totally dependent on Social Security, have no place else to turn. And they have to live and go to bed at night thinking, Is this true? Is someone going to take our check away from us and leave us destitute? And I dont think that that should be a part of political dialog.",1984-10-07,Republican
Ms. Walters,You have more time.,1984-10-07,Moderator
Reagan,"Oh, I",1984-10-07,Republican
Ms. Walters,You can keep going.,1984-10-07,Moderator
Reagan,"Okay. All right. Now, Social Security, lets lay it to rest once and for all. I told you never would I do such a thing. But I tell you also now, Social Security has nothing to do with the deficit. Social Security is totally funded by the payroll tax levied on employer and employee. If you reduce the out-go of Social Security, that money would not go into the general fund to reduce a deficit. It would go into the Social Security Trust Fund. So, Social Security has nothing to do with balancing a budget or erasing or lowering the deficit. Now, again, to get to whether I am depending on magic, I think I have talked in straight economic terms about a program of recovery that I was told wouldnt work. And then, after it worked, I was told that lowering taxes would increase inflation. And none of these things happened. It is working, and were going to continue on that same line. As to what we might do, and find in further savings cuts, no, were not going to starve the hungry. But we have 2,478 specific recommendations from a commission of more than 2,000 business people in this country, through the Grace commission, that were studying right now  and weve already implemented 17 percent of them  that are recommendations as to how to make government more efficient, more economic.",1984-10-07,Republican
Ms. Sawyer,"And to keep it even, what remaining question would you most like to see your opponent forced to answer?",1984-10-07,Moderator
Reagan,"Why the deficits are so much of a problem for him now, but that in 1976, when the deficit was $52 billion and everyone was panicking about that, he said, no, that he thought it ought to be bigger, because a bigger deficit would stimulate the economy and would help do away with unemployment. In 1979 he made similar statements, the same effect, that the deficits  there was nothing wrong with having deficits. Remember, there was a trillion dollars in debt before we got here. Thats got to be paid by our children and grandchildren, too, if we dont do it. And Im hoping we can start some payments on it before we get through here. Thats why I want another 4 years.",1984-10-07,Republican
Ms. Walters,"Well, we have time now, if youd like to answer the Presidents question, or whatever rebuttal.",1984-10-07,Moderator
Mr. Mondale,"Well, weve just finished almost the whole debate. And the American people dont have the slightest clue about what President Reagan will do about these deficits. [Laughter] And yet, thats the most important single issue of our time. I did support the 76 measure that he told about, because we were in a deep recession and we needed some stimulation. But I will say as a Democrat, I was a real piker, Mr. President. In 1979 we ran a $29 billion deficit all year. This administration seems to run that every morning. And the result is exactly what we see. This economy is starting to run downhill. Housing is off. Last report on new purchases, its the lowest since 1982. Growth is a little over 3 percent now. Many people are predicting a recession. And the flow of imports into this country is swamping the American people. Weve got to deal with this problem, and those of us who want to be your President should tell you now what were going to do, so you can make a judgment.",1984-10-07,Democrat
Ms. Walters,Thank you very much. We must stop now. I want to give you time for your closing statements. Its indeed time for that from each of you. We will begin with President Reagan.,1984-10-07,Moderator
Reagan,"No, I might as well just go with",1984-10-07,Republican
Ms. Walters,Do you want to go with your,1984-10-07,Moderator
Reagan,I dont think so. Im all confused now.,1984-10-07,Republican
Ms. Walters,"Technically, you did. I have little voices that come in my ear. [Laughter] You dont get those same voices. Im not hearing it from here  Im hearing it from here.",1984-10-07,Moderator
Reagan,All right.,1984-10-07,Republican
Ms. Walters,You have waived your rebuttal. You can go with your closing statement.,1984-10-07,Moderator
Reagan,"Well, well include it in that.",1984-10-07,Republican
Ms. Walters,Okay.,1984-10-07,Moderator
Reagan,"Four years ago, in similar circumstances to this, I asked you, the American people, a question. I asked: Are you better off than you were 4 years before? The answer to that obviously was no, and as the result, I was elected to this office and promised a new beginning. Now, maybe Im expected to ask that same question again. Im not going to, because I think that all of you  or not everyone, those people that are in those pockets of poverty and havent caught up, they couldnt answer the way I would want them to  but I think that most of the people in this country would say, yes, they are better off than they were 4 years ago. The question, I think, should be enlarged. Is America better off than it was 4 years ago? And I believe the answer to that has to also be yes. I promised a new beginning. So far, it is only a beginning. If the job were finished, I might have thought twice about seeking reelection for this job. But we now have an economy that, for the first time  well, lets put it this way: In the first half of 1980, gross national product was down a minus 3.7 percent. The first half of 84 its up 8\1/2\ percent. Productivity in the first half of 1980 was down a minus 2 percent. Today it is up a plus 4 percent. Personal earnings after taxes per capita have gone up almost $3,000 in these 4 years. In 1980  or 1979, a person with a fixed income of $8,000 was $500 above the poverty line, and this maybe explains why there are the numbers still in poverty. By 1980 that same person was $500 below the poverty line. We have restored much of our economy. With regard to business investment, it is higher than it has been since 1949. So, there seems to be no shortage of investment capital. We have, as I said, cut the taxes, but we have reduced inflation, and for 2 years now it has stayed down there, not at double digit, but in the range of 4 or below. We believe that we had also promised that we would make our country more secure. Yes, we have an increase in the defense budget. But back then we had planes that couldnt fly for lack of spare parts or pilots. We had navy vessels that couldnt leave harbor because of lack of crew or, again, lack of spare parts. Today were well on our way to a 600-ship navy. We have 543 at present. We have  our military, the morale is high. I think the people should understand that two-thirds of the defense budget pays for pay and salary, or pay and pension. And then you add to that food and wardrobe, and all the other things, and you only have a small portion going for weapons. But I am determined that if ever our men are called on, they should have the best that we can provide in the manner of tools and weapons. There has been reference to expensive spare parts, hammers costing $500. Well, we are the ones who found those. I think weve given the American people back their spirit. I think theres an optimism in the land and a patriotism, and I think that were in a position once again to heed the words of Thomas Paine, who said: We have it in our power to begin the world over again.",1984-10-07,Republican
Ms. Walters,"Thank you, Mr. Reagan. Mr. Mondale, the closing words are now yours.",1984-10-07,Moderator
Mr. Mondale,"I want to thank the League of Women Voters and the city of Louisville for hosting this evenings debate. I want to thank President Reagan for agreeing to debate. He didnt have to, and he did, and we all appreciate it. The Presidents favorite question is: Are you better off? Well, if youre wealthy, youre better off. If youre middle income, youre about where you were. And if youre modest income, youre worse off. Thats what the economists tell us. But is that really the question that should be asked? Isnt the real question is will we be better off? Will our children be better off? Are we building the future that this nation needs? I believe that if we ask those questions that bear on our future, not just congratulate ourselves but challenge us to solve those problems, youll see that we need new leadership. I would rather lose a campaign about decency than win a campaign about self-interest. I dont think this nation is composed of people who care only for themselves. And when we sought to assault Social Security and Medicare, as the record shows we did, I think that was mean-spirited. When we terminated 400,000 desperate, hopeless, defenseless Americans who were on disability  confused and unable to defend themselves, and just laid them out on the street, as we did for 4 years, I dont think thats what America is all about. America is a fair society, and it is not right that Vice President Bush pays less in taxes than the janitor who helps him. I believe theres fundamental fairness crying out that needs to be achieved in our tax system. I believe that we will be better off if we protect this environment. And contrary to what the President says, I think their record on the environment is inexcusable and often shameful. These laws are not being enforced, have not been enforced, and the public health and the air and the water are paying the price. Thats not fair for our future. I think our future requires a President to lead us in an all-out search to advance our education, our learning, and our science and training, because this world is more complex and were being pressed harder all the time. I believe in opening doors. We won the Olympics, in part, because weve had civil rights laws and the laws that prohibit discrimination against women. I have been for those efforts all my life. The Presidents record is quite different. The question is our future. President Kennedy once said in response to similar arguments, We are great, but we can be greater. We can be better if we face our future, rejoice in our strengths, face our problems, and by solving them, build a better society for our children. Thank you.",1984-10-07,Democrat
Ms. Walters,"Thank you, Mr. Mondale. [Applause] Please, we have not finished quite yet. Thank you, Mr. Mondale, and thank you, Mr. President. And our thanks to our panel members, as well. And so we bring to a close this first of the League of Women Voters Presidential debates of 1984. You two can go at each again in the final League debate on October 21st, in Kansas City, Missouri. And this Thursday night, October 11th, at 9 p.m. eastern daylight time, the Vice President, George Bush, will debate Congresswoman Geraldine Ferraro in Philadelphia. And I hope that you will all watch once again. No matter what the format is, these debates are very important. We all have an extremely vital decision to make. Once more, gentlemen, our thanks. Once more, to you, our thanks. Now, this is Barbara Walters wishing you a good evening.",1984-10-07,Moderator
Wallace,"Good evening from the Thomas and Mack Center at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. Im Chris Wallace of Fox News, and I welcome you to the third and final of the 2016 presidential debates between Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump. This debate is sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates. The commission has designed the format: Six roughly 15-minute segments with two-minute answers to the first question, then open discussion for the rest of each segment. Both campaigns have agreed to those rules. For the record, I decided the topics and the questions in each topic. None of those questions has been shared with the commission or the two candidates. The audience here in the hall has promised to remain silent. No cheers, boos, or other interruptions so we and you can focus on what the candidates have to say. Secretary Clinton, Mr. Trump, welcome. Lets get right to it. The first topic is the Supreme Court. You both talked briefly about the court in the last debate, but I want to drill down on this, because the next president will almost certainly have at least one appointment and likely or possibly two or three appointments. Which means that you will, in effect, determine the balance of the court for what could be the next quarter century. First of all, where do you want to see the court take the country? And secondly, whats your view on how the Constitution should be interpreted? Do the founders words mean what they say or is it a living document to be applied flexibly according to changing circumstances? In this segment, Secretary Clinton, you go first. You have two minutes.",2016-10-19,Moderator
Clinton,"Thank you very much, Chris. And thanks to UNLV for hosting us. And I feel strongly that the Supreme Court needs to stand on the side of the American people, not on the side of the powerful corporations and the wealthy. For me, that means that we need a Supreme Court that will stand up on behalf of womens rights, on behalf of the rights of the LGBT community, that will stand up and say no to Citizens United, a decision that has undermined the election system in our country because of the way it permits dark, unaccountable money to come into our electoral system. I have major disagreements with my opponent about these issues and others that will be before the Supreme Court. But I feel that at this point in our countrys history, it is important that we not reverse marriage equality, that we not reverse Roe v. Wade, that we stand up against Citizens United, we stand up for the rights of people in the workplace, that we stand up and basically say: The Supreme Court should represent all of us. Thats how I see the court, and the kind of people that I would be looking to nominate to the court would be in the great tradition of standing up to the powerful, standing up on behalf of our rights as Americans. And I look forward to having that opportunity. I would hope that the Senate would do its job and confirm the nominee that President Obama has sent to them. Thats the way the Constitution fundamentally should operate. The president nominates, and then the Senate advises and consents, or not, but they go forward with the process.",2016-10-19,Democrat
Wallace,"Secretary Clinton, thank you.",2016-10-19,Moderator
Trump,"Well, first of all, its great to be with you, and thank you, everybody. The Supreme Court: Its what its all about. Our country is so, soits just so imperative that we have the right justices. Something happened recently where Justice Ginsburg made some very, very inappropriate statements toward me and toward a tremendous number of people, many, many millions of people that I represent. And she was forced to apologize. And apologize she did. But these were statements that should never, ever have been made. We need a Supreme Court that in my opinion is going to uphold the Second Amendment, and all amendments, but the Second Amendment, which is under absolute siege. I believe if my opponent should win this race, which I truly dont think will happen, we will have a Second Amendment which will be a very, very small replica of what it is right now. But I feel that its absolutely important that we uphold, because of the fact that it is under such trauma. I feel that the justices that I am going to appointand Ive named 20 of themthe justices that Im going to appoint will be pro-life. They will have a conservative bent. They will be protecting the Second Amendment. They are great scholars in all cases, and theyre people of tremendous respect. They will interpret the Constitution the way the founders wanted it interpreted. And I believe thats very, very important. I dont think we should have justices appointed that decide what they want to hear. Its all about the Constitution ofofand so important, the Constitution the way it was meant to be. And those are the people that I will appoint.",2016-10-19,Republican
Wallace,"Mr. Trump, thank you. We now have about 10 minutes for an open discussion. I want to focus on two issues that, in fact, by the justices that you name could end up changing the existing law of the land. First is one that you mentioned, Mr. Trump, and that is guns.",2016-10-19,Moderator
Clinton,"Well, first of all, I support the Second Amendment. I lived in Arkansas for 18 wonderful years. I represented upstate New York. I understand and respect the tradition of gun ownership. It goes back to the founding of our country. But I also believe that there can be and must be reasonable regulation. Because I support the Second Amendment doesnt mean that I want people who shouldnt have guns to be able to threaten you, kill you or members of your family. And so when I think about what we need to do, we have 33,000 people a year who die from guns. I think we need comprehensive background checks, need to close the online loophole, close the gun show loophole. Theres other matters that I think are sensible that are the kind of reforms that would make a difference that are not in any way conflicting with the Second Amendment. You mentioned the Heller decision. And what I was saying that you referenced, Chris, was that I disagreed with the way the court applied the Second Amendment in that case, because what the District of Columbia was trying to do was to protect toddlers from guns and so they wanted people with guns to safely store them. And the court didnt accept that reasonable regulation, but theyve accepted many others. So I see no conflict between saving peoples lives and defending the Second Amendment.",2016-10-19,Democrat
Wallace,"Let me bring Mr. Trump in here. The bipartisan Open Debate Coalition got millions of votes on questions to ask here, and this was, in fact, one of the top questions that they got. How will you ensure the Second Amendment is protected? You just heard Secretary Clintons answer. Does she persuade you that, while you may disagree on regulation, that, in fact, she supports a Second Amendment right to bear arms?",2016-10-19,Moderator
Trump,"Well, the D.C. vs. Heller decision was very stronglyand she was extremely angry about it. I watched. I mean, she was very, very angry when upheld. And Justice Scalia was so involved. And it was a well-crafted decision. But Hillary was extremely upset, extremely angry. And people that believe in the Second Amendment and believe in it very strongly were very upset with what she had to say.",2016-10-19,Republican
Wallace,"Well, let me bring in Secretary Clinton. Were you extremely upset?",2016-10-19,Moderator
Clinton,"Well, I was upset because, unfortunately, dozens of toddlers injure themselves, even kill people with guns, because, unfortunately, not everyone who has loaded guns in their homes takes appropriate precautions. But theres no doubt that I respect the Second Amendment, that I also believe theres an individual right to bear arms. That is not in conflict with sensible, commonsense regulation. And, you know, look, I understand that Donalds been strongly supported by the NRA. The gun lobbys on his side. Theyre running millions of dollars of ads against me. And I regret that, because what I would like to see is for people to come together and say: of course were going to protect and defend the Second Amendment. But were going to do it in a way that tries to save some of these 33,000 lives that we lose every year.",2016-10-19,Democrat
Wallace,"Let me bring Mr. Trump back into this, because, in fact, you oppose any limits on assault weapons, any limits on high-capacity magazines. You support a national right to carry law. Why, sir?",2016-10-19,Moderator
Trump,"Well, let me just tell you before we go any further. In Chicago, which has the toughest gun laws in the United States, probably you could say by far, they have more gun violence than any other city. So we have the toughest laws, and you have tremendous gun violence. I am a very strong supporter of the Second Amendment. And I amI dont know if Hillary was saying it in a sarcastic manner, but Im very proud to have the endorsement of the NRA. And its the earliest endorsement theyve ever given to anybody who ran for president. So Im very honored by all of that. We are going to appoint justicesthis is the best way to help the Second Amendment. We are going to appoint justices that will feel very strongly about the Second Amendment, that will not do damage to the Second Amendment.",2016-10-19,Republican
Wallace,"Well, lets pick up on another issue which divides you and the justices that whoever ends up winning this election appoints could have a dramatic effect there, and thats the issue of abortion.",2016-10-19,Moderator
Trump,Right.,2016-10-19,Republican
Wallace,"Mr. Trump, youre pro-life. But I want to ask you specifically: Do you want the court, including the justices that you will name, to overturn Roe v. Wade, which includesin fact, statesa womans right to abortion?",2016-10-19,Moderator
Trump,"Well, if that would happen, because I am pro-life, and I will be appointing pro-life judges, I would think that that will go back to the individual states.",2016-10-19,Republican
Wallace,But Im asking you specifically. Would you like to,2016-10-19,Moderator
Trump,"If they overturned it, it will go back to the states.",2016-10-19,Republican
Wallace,"But what Im asking you, sir, is, do you want to see the court overturnyou just said you want to see the court protect the Second Amendment. Do you want to see the court overturn Roe v. Wade?",2016-10-19,Moderator
Trump,"Well, if we put another two or perhaps three justices on, thats really whats going to bethat will happen. And thatll happen automatically, in my opinion, because I am putting pro-life justices on the court. I will say this: It will go back to the states, and the states will then make a determination.",2016-10-19,Republican
Wallace,Secretary Clinton?,2016-10-19,Moderator
Clinton,"Well, I strongly support Roe v. Wade, which guarantees a constitutional right to a woman to make the most intimate, most difficult, in many cases, decisions about her health care that one can imagine. And in this case, its not only about Roe v. Wade. It is about whats happening right now in America. So many states are putting very stringent regulations on women that block them from exercising that choice to the extent that they are defunding Planned Parenthood, which, of course, provides all kinds of cancer screenings and other benefits for women in our country. Donald has said hes in favor of defunding Planned Parenthood. He even supported shutting the government down to defund Planned Parenthood. I will defend Planned Parenthood. I will defend Roe v. Wade, and I will defend womens rights to make their own health care decisions.",2016-10-19,Democrat
Wallace,Secretary Clinton,2016-10-19,Moderator
Clinton,"And we have come too far to have that turned back now. And, indeed, he said women should be punished, that there should be some form of punishment for women who obtain abortions. And I could just not be more opposed to that kind of thinking.",2016-10-19,Democrat
Wallace,"Im going to give you a chance to respond, but I want to ask you, Secretary Clinton, I want to explore how far you believe the right to abortion goes. You have been quoted as saying that the fetus has no constitutional rights. You also voted against a ban on late-term, partial-birth abortions. Why?",2016-10-19,Moderator
Clinton,"Because Roe v. Wade very clearly sets out that there can be regulations on abortion so long as the life and the health of the mother are taken into account. And when I voted as a senator, I did not think that that was the case. The kinds of cases that fall at the end of pregnancy are often the most heartbreaking, painful decisions for families to make. I have met with women who toward the end of their pregnancy get the worst news one could get, that their health is in jeopardy if they continue to carry to term or that something terrible has happened or just been discovered about the pregnancy. I do not think the United States government should be stepping in and making those most personal of decisions. So you can regulate if you are doing so with the life and the health of the mother taken into account.",2016-10-19,Democrat
Wallace,"Mr. Trump, your reaction? And particularly on this issue of late-term, partial-birth abortions.",2016-10-19,Moderator
Trump,"Well, I think its terrible. If you go with what Hillary is saying, in the ninth month, you can take the baby and rip the baby out of the womb of the mother just prior to the birth of the baby. Now, you can say that thats OK and Hillary can say that thats OK. But its not OK with me, because based on what shes saying, and based on where shes going, and where shes been, you can take the baby and rip the baby out of the womb in the ninth month on the final day. And thats not acceptable.",2016-10-19,Republican
Clinton,"Well, that is not what happens in these cases. And using that kind of scare rhetoric is just terribly unfortunate. You should meet with some of the women that I have met with, women I have known over the course of my life. This is one of the worst possible choices that any woman and her family has to make. And I do not believe the government should be making it. You know, Ive had the great honor of traveling across the world on behalf of our country. Ive been to countries where governments either forced women to have abortions, like they used to do in China, or forced women to bear children, like they used to do in Romania. And I can tell you: The government has no business in the decisions that women make with their families in accordance with their faith, with medical advice. And I will stand up for that right.",2016-10-19,Democrat
Wallace,"All right. But just briefly, I want to move on to another segment",2016-10-19,Moderator
Trump,"And, honestly, nobody has business doing what I just said, doing that, as late as one or two or three or four days prior to birth. Nobody has that.",2016-10-19,Republican
Wallace,"All right. Lets move on to the subject of immigration. And there is almost no issue that separates the two of you more than the issue of immigration. Actually, there are a lot of issues that separate the two of you. Mr. Trump, you go first in this segment. You have two minutes.",2016-10-19,Moderator
Trump,"Well, first of all, she wants to give amnesty, which is a disaster and very unfair to all of the people that are waiting in line for many, many years. We need strong borders. In the audience tonight, we have four mothers ofI mean, these are unbelievable people that Ive gotten to know over a period of years whose children have been killed, brutally killed by people that came into the country illegally. You have thousands of mothers and fathers and relatives all over the country. Theyre coming in illegally. Drugs are pouring in through the border. We have no country if we have no border. Hillary wants to give amnesty. She wants to have open borders. The borderas you know, the Border Patrol agents, 16,500-plus ICE last week, endorsed me. First time theyve ever endorsed a candidate. It means their job is tougher. But they know whats going on. They know it better than anybody. They want strong borders. They feel we have to have strong borders. I was up in New Hampshire the other day. The biggest complaint they haveits with all of the problems going on in the world, many of the problems caused by Hillary Clinton and by Barack Obama. All of the problemsthe single biggest problem is heroin that pours across our southern border. Its just pouring and destroying their youth. Its poisoning the blood of their youth and plenty of other people. We have to have strong borders. We have to keep the drugs out of our country. We areright now, were getting the drugs, theyre getting the cash. We need strong borders. We need absolutewe cannot give amnesty. Now, I want to build the wall. We need the wall. And the Border Patrol, ICE, they all want the wall. We stop the drugs. We shore up the border. One of my first acts will be to get all of the drug lords, all of the bad oneswe have some bad, bad people in this country that have to go out. Were going to get them out; were going to secure the border. And once the border is secured, at a later date, well make a determination as to the rest. But we have some bad hombres here, and were going to get them out.",2016-10-19,Republican
Wallace,"Mr. Trump, thank you. Same question to you, Secretary Clinton. Basically, why are you right and Mr. Trump is wrong?",2016-10-19,Moderator
Clinton,"Well, as he was talking, I was thinking about a young girl I met here in Las Vegas, Carla, who is very worried that her parents might be deported, because she was born in this country but they were not. They work hard, they do everything they can to give her a good life. And youre right. I dont want to rip families apart. I dont want to be sending parents away from children. I dont want to see the deportation force that Donald has talked about in action in our country. We have 11 million undocumented people. They have 4 million American citizen children, 15 million people. He said as recently as a few weeks ago in Phoenix that every undocumented person would be subject to deportation. Now, heres what that means. It means you would have to have a massive law enforcement presence, where law enforcement officers would be going school to school, home to home, business to business, rounding up people who are undocumented. And we would then have to put them on trains, on buses to get them out of our country. I think that is an idea that is not in keeping with who we are as a nation. I think its an idea that would rip our country apart. I have been for border security for years. I voted for border security in the United States Senate. And my comprehensive immigration reform plan of course includes border security. But I want to put our resources where I think theyre most needed: Getting rid of any violent person. Anybody who should be deported, we should deport them. When it comes to the wall that Donald talks about building, he went to Mexico, he had a meeting with the Mexican president. Didnt even raise it. He choked and then got into a Twitter war because the Mexican president said were not paying for that wall. So I think we are both a nation of immigrants and we are a nation of laws and that we can act accordingly. And thats why Im introducing comprehensive immigration reform within the first 100 days with a path to citizenship.",2016-10-19,Democrat
Wallace,"Thank you, Secretary Clinton. I want to follow up",2016-10-19,Moderator
Trump,"Chris, I think its",2016-10-19,Republican
Wallace,OK.,2016-10-19,Moderator
Trump,"I think I should respond to that. First of all, I had a very good meeting with the president of Mexico. Very nice man. We will be doing very much better with Mexico on trade deals. Believe me. The NAFTA deal signed by her husband is one of the worst deals ever made of any kind, signed by anybody. Its a disaster. Hillary Clinton wanted the wall.

But it is clear, when you look at what Donald has been proposing, he started his campaign bashing immigrants, calling Mexican immigrants rapists and criminals and drug dealers, that he has a very different view about what we should do to deal with immigrants. Now, what I am also arguing is that bringing undocumented immigrants out from the shadows, putting them into the formal economy will be good, because then employers cant exploit them and undercut Americans wages. And Donald knows a lot about this. He used undocumented labor to build the Trump Tower. He underpaid undocumented workers, and when they complained, he basically said what a lot of employers do: You complain, Ill get you deported. I want to get everybody out of the shadows, get the economy working, and not let employers like Donald exploit undocumented workers, which hurts them, but also hurts American workers.",2016-10-19,Democrat

And I do want us to have an electric grid, an energy system that crosses borders. I think that would be a great benefit to us. But you are very clearly quoting from WikiLeaks. And whats really important about WikiLeaks is that the Russian government has engaged in espionage against Americans. They have hacked American websites, American accounts of private people, of institutions. Then they have given that information to WikiLeaks for the purpose of putting it on the Internet. This has come from the highest levels of the Russian government, clearly, from Putin himself, in an effort, as 17 of our intelligence agencies have confirmed, to influence our election. So I actually think the most important question of this evening, Chris, is, finally, will Donald Trump admit and condemn that the Russians are doing this and make it clear that he will not have the help of Putin in this election, that he rejects Russian espionage against Americans, which he actually encouraged in the past.

Clinton,"Well, I think when the middle class thrives, America thrives. And so my plan is based on growing the economy, giving middle-class families many more opportunities. I want us to have the biggest jobs program since World War II, jobs in infrastructure and advanced manufacturing. I think we can compete with high-wage countries, and I believe we should. New jobs and clean energy, not only to fight climate change, which is a serious problem, but to create new opportunities and new businesses. I want us to do more to help small business. Thats where two-thirds of the new jobs are going to come from. I want us to raise the national minimum wage, because people who live in poverty should notwho work full-time should not still be in poverty. And I sure do want to make sure women get equal pay for the work we do. I feel strongly that we have to have an education system that starts with preschool and goes through college. Thats why I want more technical education in high schools and in community colleges, real apprenticeships to prepare young people for the jobs of the future. I want to make college debt-free and for families making less than $125,000, you will not get a tuition bill from a public college or university if the plan that I worked on with Bernie Sanders is enacted. And were going to work hard to make sure that it is, because we are going to go where the money is. Most of the gains in the last years since the Great Recession have gone to the very top. So we are going to have the wealthy pay their fair share. Were going to have corporations make a contribution greater than they are now to our country. That is a plan that has been analyzed by independent experts which said that it could produce 10 million new jobs. By contrast, Donalds plan has been analyzed to conclude it might lose 3.5 million jobs. Why? Because his whole plan is to cut taxes, to give the biggest tax breaks ever to the wealthy and to corporations, adding $20 trillion to our debt, and causing the kind of dislocation that we have seen before, because it truly will be trickle-down economics on steroids. So the plan I have I think will actually produce greater opportunities. The plan he has will cost us jobs and possibly lead to another Great Recession.",2016-10-19,Democrat

And Im a big proponent. Were going to do a lot of things for college tuition. But the rest of the publics going to be paying for it. We will have a massive, massive tax increase under Hillary Clintons plan. She immediatelywhen she heard this, I questioned it, and I questioned NATO. Why arent the NATO questionedwhy arent they paying? Because they werent paying. Since I did thisthis was a year agoall of a sudden, theyre paying. And Ive been given a lota lot of credit for it. All of a sudden, theyre starting to pay up. They have to pay up. Were protecting people, they have to pay up. And Im a big fan of NATO. But they have to pay up. She comes out and said, we love our allies, we think our allies are great. Well, its awfully hard to get them to pay up when you have somebody saying we think how great they are. We have to tell Japan in a very nice way, we have to tell Germany, all of these countries, South Korea, we have to say, you have to help us out. We have, during his regime, during President Obamas regime, weve doubled our national debt. Were up to $20 trillion. So my planwere going to renegotiate trade deals. Were going to have a lot of free trade. Were going to have free trade, more free trade than we have right now. But we have horrible deals. Our jobs are being taken out by the deal that her husband signed, NAFTA, one of the worst deals ever. Our jobs are being sucked out of our economy. You look at all of the places that I just left, you go to Pennsylvania, you go to Ohio, you go to Florida, you go to any of them. You go upstate New York. Our jobs have fled to Mexico and other places. Were bringing our jobs back. I am going to renegotiate NAFTA.

He will, through his massive tax cuts, add $20 trillion to the debt. Well, he mentioned the debt. We know how to get control of the debt. When my husband was president, we went from a $300 billion deficit to a $200 billion surplus and we were actually on the path to eliminating the national debt. When President Obama came into office, he inherited the worst economic disaster since the Great Depression. He has cut the deficit by two-thirds. So, yes, one of the ways you go after the debt, one of the ways you create jobs is by investing in people. So I do have investments, investments in new jobs, investments in education, skill training, and the opportunities for people to get ahead and stay ahead.

I was in the Senate before I became secretary of state. Ive never seen people as physically distraught as the Bush administration team was because of what was happening to the economy. I personally believe that the steps that President Obama took saved the economy. He doesnt get the credit he deserves for taking some very hard positions. But it was a terrible recession. So now weve dug ourselves out of it, were standing, but were not yet running. So what I am proposing is that we invest from the middle out and the ground up, not the top down. That is not going to work. Thats why what I have put forward doesnt add a penny to the debt, but it is the kind of approach that will enable more people to take those new jobs, higher-paying jobs.

I pass factories that were thriving 20, 25 years ago, and because of the bill that her husband signed and she blessed 100 percent, it is just horrible whats happened to these people in these communities.

Because what I saw what they did, which is a criminal act, by the way, where theyre telling people to go out and start fist-fights and start violence. And Ill tell you what, in particular in Chicago, people were hurt and people could have been killed in that riot. And that was now all on tape, started by her. I believe, Chris, that she got these people to step forward. If it wasnt, they get their 10 minutes of fame. But they were all totallyit was all fiction.

He goes after their dignity, their self-worth, and I dont think there is a woman anywhere who doesnt know what that feels like. So we now know what Donald thinks and what he says and how he acts toward women. Thats who Donald is. I think its really up to all of us to demonstrate who we are and who our country is, and to stand up and be very clear about what we expect from our next president, how we want to bring our country together, where we dont want to have the kind of pitting of people one against the other, where instead we celebrate our diversity, we lift people up, and we make our country even greater.

What happened to the FBI, I dont know. We have a great general, four-star general, today you read it in all of the papers, going to potentially serve five years in jail for lying to the FBI. One lie. Shes lied hundreds of times to the people, to Congress, and to the FBI. Hes going to probably go to jail. This is a four-star general.

So its not one thing. This is a pattern, a pattern of divisiveness, of a very dark and in many ways dangerous vision of our country, where he incites violence, where he applauds people who are pushing and pulling and punching at his rallies.

And thats something that whichever of you ends upwhoever of you ends up as president is going to have to confront.

You have two minutes.",2016-10-19,Moderator

But I will not support putting American soldiers into Iraq as an occupying force. I dont think that is in our interest, and I dont think that would be smart to do. In fact, Chris, I think that would be a big red flag waving for ISIS to reconstitute itself. The goal here is to take back Mosul. Its going to be a hard fight. Ive got no illusions about that. And then continue to press into Syria to begin to take back and move on Raqqa, which is the ISIS headquarters. I am hopeful that the hard work that American military advisers have done will pay off and that we will see a reala really successful military operation. But we know weve got lots of work to do. Syria will remain a hotbed of terrorism as long as the civil war, aided and abetted by the Iranians and the Russians, continue. So I have said, look, we need to keep our eye on ISIS. Thats why I want to have an intelligence surge that protects us here at home, why we have to go after them from the air, on the ground, online, why we have to make sure here at home we dont let terrorists buy weapons. If youre too dangerous to fly, youre too dangerous to buy a gun. And Im going to continue to push for a no-fly zone and safe havens within Syria not only to help protect the Syrians and prevent the constant outflow of refugees, but to, frankly, gain some leverage on both the Syrian government and the Russians so that perhaps we can have the kind of serious negotiation necessary to bring the conflict to an end and go forward on a political track.",2016-10-19,Democrat

Trump,"Let me tell you, Mosul is so sad. We had Mosul. But when she left, when she took everybody out, we lost Mosul. Now were fighting again to get Mosul. The problem with Mosul and what they wanted to do is they wanted to get the leaders of ISIS who they felt were in Mosul. About three months ago, I started reading that they want to get the leaders and theyre going to attack Mosul. Whatever happened to the element of surprise, OK? We announce were going after Mosul. I have been reading about going after Mosul now for abouthow long is it, Hillary, three months? These people have all left. Theyve all left. The element of surprise. Douglas MacArthur, George Patton spinning in their graves when they see the stupidity of our country. So were now fighting for Mosul, that we had. All she had to do was stay there, and now were going in to get it. But you know who the big winner in Mosul is going to be after we eventually get it? And the only reason they did it is because shes running for the office of president and they want to look tough. They want to look good. He violated the red line in the sand, and he made so many mistakes, made all mistakes. Thats why we have the great migration. But she wanted to look good for the election. So theyre going in. But whos going to get Mosul, really? Well take Mosul eventually. But the wayif you look at whats happening, much tougher than they thought. Much, much tougher. Much more dangerous. Going to be more deaths that they thought. But the leaders that we wanted to get are all gone because theyre smart. They say, what do we need this for? So Mosul is going to be a wonderful thing. And Iran should write us a letter of thank you, just like the really stupidthe stupidest deal of all time, a deal thats going to give Iran absolutely nuclear weapons. Iran should write us yet another letter saying thank you very much, because Iran, as I said many years ago, Iran is taking over Iraq, something theyve wanted to do forever, but weve made it so easy for them. So were now going to take Mosul. And you know whos going to be the beneficiary? Iran. Oh, yeah, theyre makingI mean, they are outsmartinglook, youre not there, you might be involved in that decision. But you were there when you took everybody out of Mosul and out of Iraq. You shouldnt have been in Iraq, but you did vote for it.

Mosul is on the border of Syria. And, yes, we do need to go after Baghdadi, andjust like we went after bin Laden, while you were doing Celebrity Apprentice, and we brought him to justice. We need to go after the leadership. But we need to get rid of them, get rid of their fighters. There are an estimated several thousand fighters in Mosul. Theyve been digging underground. Theyve been prepared to defend. Its going to be tough fighting. But I think we can take back Mosul, and then we can move on into Syria and take back Raqqa. This is what we have to do. Im just amazed that he seems to think that the Iraqi government and our allies and everybody else launched the attack on Mosul to help me in this election, but thats how Donald thinks.

Wallace,"Secretary Clinton, you have talked aboutand in the last debate and again todaythat you would impose a no-fly zone to try to protect the people of Aleppo and to stop the killing there. President Obama has refused to do that because he fears its going to draw us closer or deeper into the conflict.",2016-10-19,Moderator
Clinton,"Well, Chris, first of all, I think a no-fly zone could save lives and could hasten the end of the conflict. Im well aware of the really legitimate concerns that you have expressed from both the president and the general. This would not be done just on the first day. This would take a lot of negotiation. And it would also take making it clear to the Russians and the Syrians that our purpose here was to provide safe zones on the ground. Weve had millions of people leave Syria and those millions of people inside Syria who have been dislocated. So I think we could strike a deal and make it very clear to the Russians and the Syrians that this was something that we believe was in the best interests of the people on the ground in Syria, it would help us with our fight against ISIS. But I want to respond to what Donald said about refugees. Hes made these claims repeatedly. I am not going to let anyone into this country who is not vetted, who we do not have confidence in. But I am not going to slam the door on women and children. That picture of that little 4-year-old boy in Aleppo, with the blood coming down his face while he sat in an ambulance, is haunting. And so we are going to do very careful, thorough vetting. That does not solve our internal challenges with ISIS and our need to stop radicalization, to work with American Muslim communities who are on the front lines to identify and prevent attacks. In fact, the killer of the dozens of people at the nightclub in Orlando, the Pulse nightclub, was born in Queens, the same place Donald was born. So lets be clear about what the threat is and how we are best going to be able to meet it. And, yes, some of that threat emanates from over in Syria and Iraq, and weve got to keep fighting, and I will defeat ISIS, and some of it is we have to up our game and be much smarter here at home.",2016-10-19,Democrat

Trump,"We should havewait one second. They had a cease-fire three weeks ago. A cease-fire, United States, Russia, and Syria. And during the cease-fire, Russia took over vast swatches of land, and then they said we dont want the cease-fire anymore. We are so outplayed on missiles, on cease-fires. They are outplayed. Now, she wasnt there. I assume she had nothing to do with it. But our country is so outplayed by Putin and Assad, and by the wayand by Iran. Nobody can believe how stupid our leadership is.",2016-10-19,Republican
Wallace,"Mr. Trump, Secretary Clintonno, we need to move on to our final segment, and that is the national debt, which has not been discussed until tonight. Our national debt, as a share of the economy, our GDP, is now 77 percent. Thats the highest since just after World War II. But the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget says, Secretary Clinton, under your plan, debt would rise to 86 percent of GDP over the next 10 years. Mr. Trump, under your plan, they say it would rise to 105 percent of GDP over the next 10 years. The question is, why are both of you ignoring this problem? Mr. Trump, you go first.",2016-10-19,Moderator
Trump,"Well, I say theyre wrong, because Im going to create tremendous jobs. And were bringing GDP from, really, 1 percent, which is what it is now, and if she got in, it will be less than zero. But were bringing it from 1 percent up to 4 percent. And I actually think we can go higher than 4 percent. I think you can go to 5 percent or 6 percent. And if we do, you dont have to bother asking your question, because we have a tremendous machine. We will have created a tremendous economic machine once again. To do that, were taking back jobs. Were not going to let our companies be raided by other countries where we lose all our jobs, we dont make our product anymore. Its very sad. But Im going to create athe kind of a country that we were from the standpoint of industry. We used to be there. Weve given it up. Weve become very, very sloppy. Weve had people that are political hacks making the biggest deals in the world, bigger than companies. You take these big companies, these trade deals are far bigger than these companies, and yet we dont use our great leaders, many of whom back me and many of whom back Hillary, I must say. But we dont use those people. Those are the peoplethese are the greatest negotiators in the world. We have the greatest businesspeople in the world. We have to use them to negotiate our trade deals. We use political hacks. We use people that get the position because they gavethey made a campaign contribution and theyre dealing with China and people that are very much smarter than they are. So we have to use our great people. But that being said, we will create an economic machine the likes of which we havent seen in many decades. And people, Chris, will again go back to work and theyll make a lot of money. And well have companies that will grow and expand and start from new.",2016-10-19,Republican
Wallace,Secretary Clinton?,2016-10-19,Moderator
Clinton,"Well, first, when I hear Donald talk like that and know that his slogan is Make America Great Again, I wonder when he thought America was great. And before he rushes and says, You know, before you and President Obama were there, I think its important to recognize that he has been criticizing our government for decades. You know, back in 1987, he took out a $100,000 ad in the New York Times, during the time when President Reagan was president, and basically said exactly what he just said now, that we were the laughingstock of the world. He was criticizing President Reagan. This is the way Donald thinks about himself, puts himself into, you know, the middle and says, You know, I alone can fix it, as he said on the convention stage. But if you look at the debt, which is the issue you asked about, Chris, I pay for everything Im proposing. I do not add a penny to the national debt. I take that very seriously, because I do think its one of the issues weve got to come to grips with. So when I talk about how were going to pay for education, how were going to invest in infrastructure, how were going to get the cost of prescription drugs down, and a lot of the other issues that people talk to me about all the time, Ive made it very clear we are going where the money is. We are going to ask the wealthy and corporations to pay their fair share. And there is no evidence whatsoever that that will slow down or diminish our growth. In fact, I think just the opposite. Well have what economists call middle-out growth. Weve got to get back to rebuilding the middle class, the families of America. Thats where growth will come from. Thats why I want to invest in you. I want to invest in your family.",2016-10-19,Democrat

Now, the Committee for federala Responsible Federal Budget has looked at both of your plans and they say neither of you has a serious plan that is going to solve the fact that Medicares going to run out of money in the 2020s, Social Security is going to run out of money in the 2030s, and at that time, recipients are going to take huge cuts in their benefits.",2016-10-19,Moderator

Its destroying our businesses, our small business and our big businesses. We have to repeal and replace Obamacare. You take a look at the kind of numbers that that will cost us in the year 17, it is a disaster. If we dont repeal and replacenow, its probably going to die of its own weight. But Obamacare has to go. Itsthe premiums are going up 60 percent, 70 percent, 80 percent. Next year theyre going to go up over 100 percent. And Im really glad that the premiums have startedat least the people see whats happening, because she wants to keep Obamacare and she wants to make it even worse, and it cant get any worse.

Edwin Newman, formerly of NBC News and now a syndicated columnist for King Features, is our moderator. Ed.",1984-10-21,Moderator
Mr. Newman,"Dorothy Ridings, thank you. A brief word about our procedure tonight. The first question will go to Mr. Mondale. Hell have 2\1/2\ minutes to reply. Then the panel member who put the question will ask a followup. The answer to that will be limited to 1 minute. After that, the same question will be put to President Reagan. Again, there will be a followup. And then each man will have 1 minute for rebuttal. The second question will go to President Reagan first. After that, the alternating will continue. At the end there will be 4-minute summations, with President Reagan going last. We have asked the questioners to be brief. Lets begin. Ms. Geyer, your question to Mr. Mondale.",1984-10-21,Moderator
Ms. Geyer,"Mr. Mondale, two related questions on the crucial issue of Central America. You and the Democratic Party have said that the only policy toward the horrendous civil wars in Central America should be on the economic development and negotiations, with perhaps a quarantine of Marxist Nicaragua. Do you believe that these answers would in any way solve the bitter conflicts there? Do you really believe that there is no need to resort to force at all? Are not the solutions to Central Americas gnawing problems simply, again, too weak and too late?",1984-10-21,Moderator
Mr. Mondale,"I believe that the question oversimplifies the difficulties of what we must do in Central America. Our objectives ought to be to strengthen the democracies, to stop Communist and other extremist influences, and stabilize the community in that area. To do that we need a three-pronged attack: one is military assistance to our friends who are being pressured; secondly, a strong and sophisticated economic aid program and human rights program that offers a better life and a sharper alternative to the alternative offered by the totalitarians who oppose us; and finally, a strong diplomatic effort that pursues the possibilities of peace in the area. This brings up the whole question of what Presidential leadership is all about. I think the lesson in Central America, this recent embarrassment in Nicaragua where we are giving instructions for hired assassins, hiring criminals, and the rest  all of this has strengthened our opponents. A President must not only assure that were tough, but we must also be wise and smart in the exercise of that power. We saw the same thing in Lebanon, where we spent a good deal of Americas assets. But because the leadership of this government did not pursue wise policies, we have been humiliated, and our opponents are stronger. The bottom line of national strength is that the President must be in command, he must lead. And when a President doesnt know that submarine missiles are recallable, says that 70 percent of our strategic forces are conventional, discovers 3 years into his administration that our arms control efforts have failed because he didnt know that most Soviet missiles were on land  these are things a President must know to command. A President is called the Commander in Chief. And hes called that because hes supposed to be in charge of the facts and run our government and strengthen our nation.",1984-10-21,Democrat
Ms. Geyer,"Mr. Mondale, if I could broaden the question just a little bit: Since World War II, every conflict that we as Americans have been involved with has been in non-conventional or irregular terms. And yet, we keep fighting in conventional or traditional military terms.",1984-10-21,Moderator
Mr. Mondale,"We absolutely must, which is why I responded to your first question the way I did. Its much more complex. You must understand the region; you must understand the politics in the area; you must provide a strong alternative; and you must show strength  and all at the same time. Thats why I object to the covert action in Nicaragua. Thats a classic example of a strategy thats embarrassed us, strengthened our opposition, and undermined the moral authority of our people and our country in the region. Strength requires knowledge, command. Weve seen in the Nicaraguan example a policy that has actually hurt us, strengthened our opposition, and undermined the moral authority of our country in that region.",1984-10-21,Democrat
Ms. Geyer,"Mr. President, in the last few months it has seemed more and more that your policies in Central America were beginning to work. Yet, just at this moment, we are confronted with the extraordinary story of a CIA guerrilla manual for the anti-Sandinista contras whom we are backing, which advocates not only assassinations of Sandinistas but the hiring of criminals to assassinate the guerrillas we are supporting in order to create martyrs. Is this not, in effect, our own state-supported terrorism?",1984-10-21,Moderator
Reagan,"No, but Im glad you asked that question, because I know its on many peoples minds. I have ordered an investigation. I know that the CIA is already going forward with one. We have a gentleman down in Nicaragua who is on contract to the CIA, advising  supposedly on military tactics  the contras. And he drew up this manual. It was turned over to the agency head of the CIA in Nicaragua to be printed. And a number of pages were excised by that agency head there, the man in charge, and he sent it on up here to CIA, where more pages were excised before it was printed. But some way or other, there were 12 of the original copies that got out down there and were not submitted for this printing process by the CIA. Now, those are the details as we have them. And as soon as we have an investigation and find out where any blame lies for the few that did not get excised or changed, we certainly are going to do something about that. Well take the proper action at the proper time. I was very interested to hear about Central America and our process down there, and I thought for a moment that instead of a debate I was going to find Mr. Mondale in complete agreement with what were doing, because the plan that he has outlined is the one weve been following for quite some time, including diplomatic processes throughout Central America and working closely with the Contadora group. So, I can only tell you about the manual  that were not in the habit of assigning guilt before there has been proper evidence produced and proof of that guilt. But if guilt is established, whoever is guilty we will treat with that situation then, and they will be removed.",1984-10-21,Republican
Ms. Geyer,"Well, Mr. President, you are implying then that the CIA in Nicaragua is directing the contras there. Id also like to ask whether having the CIA investigate its own manual in such a sensitive area is not sort of like sending the fox into the chicken coop a second time?",1984-10-21,Moderator
Reagan,"Im afraid I misspoke when I said a CIA head in Nicaragua. Theres not someone there directing all of this activity. There are, as you know, CIA men stationed in other countries in the world and, certainly, in Central America. And so it was a man down there in that area that this was delivered to, and he recognized that what was in that manual was in direct contravention of my own Executive order, in December of 1981, that we would have nothing to do with regard to political assassinations.",1984-10-21,Republican
Mr. Newman,"Mr. Mondale, your rebuttal.",1984-10-21,Moderator
Mr. Mondale,"What is a President charged with doing when he takes his oath of office? He raises his right hand and takes an oath of office to take care to faithfully execute the laws of the land. A President cant know everything, but a President has to know those things that are essential to his leadership and the enforcement of our laws. This manual  several thousands of which were produced  was distributed, ordering political assassinations, hiring of criminals, and other forms of terrorism. Some of it was excised, but the part dealing with political terrorism was continued. How can this happen? How can something this serious occur in an administration and have a President of the United States in a situation like this say he didnt know? A President must know these things. I dont know which is worse, not knowing or knowing and not stopping it. And what about the mining of the harbors in Nicaragua which violated international law? This has hurt this country, and a Presidents supposed to command.",1984-10-21,Democrat
Mr. Newman,"Mr. President, your rebuttal.",1984-10-21,Moderator
Reagan,"Yes. I have so many things there to respond to, Im going to pick out something you said earlier. Youve been all over the country repeating something that, I will admit, the press has also been repeating  that I believed that nuclear missiles could be fired and then called back. I never, ever conceived of such a thing. I never said any such thing. In a discussion of our strategic arms negotiations, I said that submarines carrying missiles and airplanes carrying missiles were more conventional-type weapons, not as destabilizing as the land-based missiles, and that they were also weapons that  or carriers  that if they were sent out and there was a change, you could call them back before they had launched their missiles.",1984-10-21,Republican
Mr. Newman,"Mr. Kalb, your question to President Reagan.",1984-10-21,Moderator
Mr. Kalb,"Mr. President, you have often described the Soviet Union as a powerful, evil empire intent on world domination. But this year you have said, and I quote. If they want to keep their Mickey Mouse system, thats okay with me. Which is it, Mr. President? Do you want to contain them within their present borders and perhaps try to reestablish detente  or what goes for detente  or do you really want to roll back their empire?",1984-10-21,Moderator
Reagan,"I have said on a number of occasions exactly what I believe about the Soviet Union. I retract nothing that I have said. I believe that many of the things they have done are evil in any concept of morality that we have. But I also recognize that as the two great superpowers in the world, we have to live with each other. And I told Mr. Gromyko we dont like their system. They dont like ours. And were not going to change their system, and they sure better not try to change ours. But between us, we can either destroy the world or we can save it. And I suggested that, certainly, it was to their common interest, along with ours, to avoid a conflict and to attempt to save the world and remove the nuclear weapons. And I think that perhaps we established a little better understanding. I think that in dealing with the Soviet Union one has to be realistic. I know that Mr. Mondale, in the past, has made statements as if they were just people like ourselves, and if we were kind and good and did something nice, they would respond accordingly. And the result was unilateral disarmament. We canceled the B  1 under the previous administration. What did we get for it? Nothing. The Soviet Union has been engaged in the biggest military buildup in the history of man at the same time that we tried the policy of unilateral disarmament, of weakness, if you will. And now we are putting up a defense of our own. And Ive made it very plain to them, we seek no superiority. We simply are going to provide a deterrent so that it will be too costly for them if they are nursing any ideas of aggression against us. Now, they claim theyre not. And I made it plain to them, were not. Theres been no change in my attitude at all. I just thought when I came into office it was time that there was some realistic talk to and about the Soviet Union. And we did get their attention.",1984-10-21,Republican
Mr. Kalb,"Mr. President, perhaps the other side of the coin, a related question, sir. Since World War II, the vital interests of the United States have always been defined by treaty commitments and by Presidential proclamations. Aside from what is obvious, such as NATO, for example, which countries, which regions in the world do you regard as vital national interests of this country, meaning that you would send American troops to fight there if they were in danger?",1984-10-21,Moderator
Reagan,"Ah, well, now youve added a hypothetical there at the end, Mr. Kalb, about where we would send troops in to fight. I am not going to make the decision as to what the tactics could be, but obviously there are a number of areas in the world that are of importance to us. One is the Middle East, and that is of interest to the whole Western World and the industrialized nations, because of the great supply of energy upon which so many depend there. Our neighbors here in America are vital to us. Were working right now in trying to be of help in southern Africa with regard to the independence of Namibia and the removal of the Cuban surrogates, the thousands of them, from Angola. So, I can say there are a great many interests. I believe that we have a great interest in the Pacific Basin. That is where I think the future of the world lies. But I am not going to pick out one and, in advance, hypothetically say, Oh, yes, we would send troops there. I dont want to send troops any place.",1984-10-21,Republican
Mr. Newman,"Im sorry, Mr. President. Sir, your time was up.",1984-10-21,Moderator
Reagan,All right.,1984-10-21,Republican
Mr. Kalb,"Mr. Mondale, you have described the Soviet leaders as, and Im quoting, . . . cynical, ruthless, and dangerous, suggesting an almost total lack of trust in them. In that case, what makes you think that the annual summit meetings with them that you have proposed will result in agreements that would satisfy the interests of this country?",1984-10-21,Moderator
Mr. Mondale,"Because the only type of agreements to reach with the Soviet Union are the types that are specifically defined, so we know exactly what they must do; subject to full verification, which means we know every day whether theyre living up to it; and followups, wherever we find suggestions that theyre violating it; and the strongest possible terms. I have no illusions about the Soviet Union leadership or the nature of that state. They are a tough and a ruthless adversary, and we must be prepared to meet that challenge, and I would. Where I part with the President is that despite all of those differences we must, as past Presidents before this one have done, meet on the common ground of survival. And thats where the President has opposed practically every arms control agreement, by every President, of both political parties, since the bomb went off. And he now completes this term with no progress toward arms control at all, but with a very dangerous arms race underway instead. There are now over 2,000 more warheads pointed at us today than there were when he was sworn in, and that does not strengthen us. We must be very, very realistic in the nature of that leadership, but we must grind away and talk to find ways of reducing these differences, particularly where arms races are concerned and other dangerous exercises of Soviet power. There will be no unilateral disarmament under my administration. I will keep this nation strong. I understand exactly what the Soviets are up to, but that, too, is a part of national strength. To do that, a President must know what is essential to command and to leadership and to strength. And thats where the Presidents failure to master, in my opinion, the essential elements of arms control has cost us dearly. Hes 3 years into this administration. He said he just discovered that most Soviet missiles are on land, and thats why his proposal didnt work. I invite the American people tomorrow  because I will issue the statement quoting President Reagan  he said exactly what I said he said. He said that these missiles were less dangerous than ballistic missiles because you could fire them, and you could recall them if you decided thered been a miscalculation.",1984-10-21,Democrat

Mr. Mondale,A President must know those things.,1984-10-21,Democrat
Mr. Kalb,"A related question, Mr. Mondale, on Eastern Europe. Do you accept the conventional diplomatic wisdom that Eastern Europe is a Soviet sphere of influence? And if you do, what could a Mondale administration realistically do to help the people of Eastern Europe achieve the human rights that were guaranteed to them as a result of the Helsinki accords?",1984-10-21,Moderator
Mr. Mondale,"I think the essential strategy of the United States ought not accept any Soviet control over Eastern Europe. We ought to deal with each of these countries separately. We ought to pursue strategies with each of them, economic and the rest, that help them pull away from their dependence upon the Soviet Union. Where the Soviet Union has acted irresponsibly, as they have in many of those countries, especially, recently, in Poland, I believe we ought to insist that Western credits extended to the Soviet Union bear the market rate. Make the Soviets pay for their irresponsibility. That is a very important objective  to make certain that we continue to look forward to progress toward greater independence by these nations and work with each of them separately.",1984-10-21,Democrat

Reagan,"Yes. Im not going to continue trying to respond to these repetitions of the falsehoods that have already been stated here. But with regard to whether Mr. Mondale would be strong, as he said he would be, I know that he has a commercial out where hes appearing on the deck of the Nimitz and watching the F  14s take off. And thats an image of strength  except that if he had had his way when the Nimitz was being planned, he would have been deep in the water out there because there wouldnt have been any Nimitz to stand on  he was against it. [Laughter] He was against the F  14 fighter, he was against the M  1 tank, he was against the B  1 bomber, he wanted to cut the salary of all of the military, he wanted to bring home half of the American forces in Europe. And he has a record of weakness with regard to our national defense that is second to none.",1984-10-21,Republican

Mr. Mondale,"Mr. President, I accept your commitment to peace, but I want you to accept my commitment to a strong national defense. [Applause] I propose a budget  I have proposed a budget which would increase our nations strength, in real terms, by double that of the Soviet Union. Ill tell you where we disagree. It is true over 10 years ago I voted to delay production of the F  14, and Ill tell you why. The plane wasnt flying the way it was supposed to be; it was a waste of money. Your definition of national strength is to throw money at the Defense Department. My definition of national strength is to make certain that a dollar spent buys us a dollars worth of defense. Theres a big difference between the two of us. A President must manage that budget. I will keep us strong, but youll not do that unless you command that budget and make certain we get the strength that we need. You pay $500 for a $5 hammer, youre not buying strength.",1984-10-21,Democrat
Mr. Newman,"I would ask the audience not to applaud. All it does is take up time that we would like to devote to the debate. Mr. Kondracke, your question to Mr. Mondale.",1984-10-21,Moderator
Mr. Kondracke,"Mr. Mondale, in an address earlier this year you said that before this country resorts to military force, and Im quoting, American interests should be sharply defined, publicly supported, congressionally sanctioned, militarily feasible, internationally defensible, open to independent scrutiny, and alert to regional history. Now, arent you setting up such a gauntlet of tests here that adversaries could easily suspect that as President you would never use force to protect American interests?",1984-10-21,Moderator
Mr. Mondale,"No. As a matter of fact, I believe every one of those standards is essential to the exercise of power by this country. And we can see that in both Lebanon and in Central America. In Lebanon, this President exercised American power, all right, but the management of it was such that our marines were killed, we had to leave in humiliation, the Soviet Union became stronger, terrorists became emboldened. And it was because they did not think through how power should be exercised, did not have the American public with them on a plan that worked, that we ended up the way we did. Similarly, in Central America: What were doing in Nicaragua with this covert war  which the Congress, including many Republicans, have tried to stop  is finally end up with a public definition of American power that hurts us, where we get associated with political assassins and the rest. We have to decline, for the first time in modern history, jurisdiction in the World Court because theyll find us guilty of illegal actions. And our enemies are strengthened from all of this. We need to be strong, we need to be prepared to use that strength, but we must understand that we are a democracy. We are a government by the people, and when we move, it should be for very severe and extreme reasons that serve our national interests and end up with a stronger country behind us. It is only in that way that we can persevere.",1984-10-21,Democrat
Mr. Kondracke,"Youve been quoted as saying that you might quarantine Nicaragua. Id like to know what that means. Would you stop Soviet ships, as President Kennedy did in 1962? And wouldnt that be more dangerous than President Reagans covert war?",1984-10-21,Moderator
Mr. Mondale,"What Im referring to there is the mutual self-defense provisions that exist in the Inter-American treaty, the so-called Rio Pact, that permits the nations, our friends in that region, to combine to take steps  diplomatic and otherwise  to prevent Nicaragua, when she acts irresponsibly in asserting power in other parts outside of her border, to take those steps, whatever they might be, to stop it. The Nicaraguans must know that it is the policy of our government that that leadership must stay behind the boundaries of their nation, not interfere in other nations. And by working with all of the nations in the region  unlike the policies of this administration and unlike the President said, they have not supported negotiations in that region  we will be much stronger, because well have the moral authority that goes with those efforts.",1984-10-21,Democrat
Mr. Kondracke,"President Reagan, you introduced U.S. forces into Lebanon as neutral peacekeepers, but then you made them combatants on the side of the Lebanese Government. Eventually you were forced to withdraw them under fire, and now Syria, a Soviet ally, is dominant in the country. Doesnt Lebanon represent a major failure on the part of your administration and raise serious questions about your capacity as a foreign policy strategist and as Commander in Chief?",1984-10-21,Moderator
Reagan,"No, Morton, I dont agree to all of those things. First of all, when we and our allies  the Italians, the French, and the United Kingdom  went into Lebanon, we went in there at the request of what was left of the Lebanese Government to be a stabilizing force while they tried to establish a government. But the first  pardon me  the first time we went in, we went in at their request because the war was going on right in Beirut between Israel and the PLO terrorists. Israel could not be blamed for that. Those terrorists had been violating their northern border consistently, and Israel chased them all the way to there. Then we went in with the multinational force to help remove, and did remove, more than 13,000 of those terrorists from Lebanon. We departed. And then the Government of Lebanon asked us back in as a stabilizing force while they established a government and sought to get the foreign forces all the way out of Lebanon and that they could then take care of their own borders. And we were succeeding. We were there for the better part of a year. Our position happened to be at the airport. Oh, there were occasional snipings and sometimes some artillery fire, but we did not engage in conflict that was out of line with our mission. I will never send troops anywhere on a mission of that kind without telling them that if somebody shoots at them, they can darn well shoot back. And this is what we did. We never initiated any kind of action; we defended ourselves there. But we were succeeding to the point that the Lebanese Government had been organized  if you will remember, there were the meetings in Geneva in which they began to meet with the hostile factional forces and try to put together some kind of a peace plan. We were succeeding, and that was why the terrorist acts began. There are forces there  and that includes Syria, in my mind  who dont want us to succeed, who dont want that kind of a peace with a dominant Lebanon, dominant over its own territory. And so, the terrorist acts began and led to the one great tragedy when they were killed in that suicide bombing of the building. Then the multilateral force withdrew for only one reason: We withdrew because we were no longer able to carry out the mission for which we had been sent in. But we went in in the interest of peace and to keep Israel and Syria from getting into the sixth war between them. And I have no apologies for our going on a peace mission.",1984-10-21,Republican
Mr. Kondracke,"Mr. President, 4 years ago you criticized President Carter for ignoring ample warnings that our diplomats in Iran might be taken hostage. Havent you done exactly the same thing in Lebanon, not once, but three times, with 300 Americans, not hostages, but dead? And you vowed swift retaliation against terrorists, but doesnt our lack of response suggest that youre just bluffing?",1984-10-21,Moderator
Reagan,"Morton, no. I think theres a great difference between the Government of Iran threatening our diplomatic personnel, and there is a government that you can see and can put your hand on. In the terrorist situation, there are terrorist factions all over. In a recent 30-day period, 37 terrorist acts in 20 countries have been committed. The most recent has been the one in Brighton. In dealing with terrorists, yes, we want to retaliate, but only if we can put our finger on the people responsible and not endanger the lives of innocent civilians there in the various communities and in the city of Beirut where these terrorists are operating. I have just signed legislation to add to our ability to deal, along with our allies, with this terrorist problem. And its going to take all the nations together, just as when we banded together we pretty much resolved the whole problem of skyjackings sometime ago. Well, the red light went on. I could have gone on forever.",1984-10-21,Republican
Mr. Newman,"Mr. Mondale, your rebuttal?",1984-10-21,Moderator
Mr. Mondale,"Groucho Marx said, Who do you believe?  me, or your own eyes? And what we have in Lebanon is something that the American people have seen. The Joint Chiefs urged the President not to put our troops in that barracks because they were indefensible. They went to him 5 days before they were killed and said, Please, take them out of there. The Secretary of State admitted that this morning. He did not do so. The report following the explosion of the barracks disclosed that we had not taken any of the steps that we should have taken. That was the second time. Then the Embassy was blown up a few weeks ago, and once again none of the steps that should have been taken were taken. And we were warned 5 days before that explosives were on their way, and they werent taken. The terrorists have won each time. The President told the terrorists he was going to retaliate. He didnt. They called their bluff. And the bottom line is that the United States left in humiliation, and our enemies are stronger.",1984-10-21,Democrat
Mr. Newman,"Mr. President, your rebuttal?",1984-10-21,Moderator
Reagan,"Yes. First of all, Mr. Mondale should know that the President of the United States did not order the marines into that barracks. That was a command decision made by the commanders on the spot and based with what they thought was best for the men there. That is one. On the other things that youve just said about the terrorists, Im tempted to ask you what you would do. These are unidentified people, and after the bomb goes off, theyre blown to bits because they are suicidal individuals who think theyre going to go to paradise if they perpetrate such an act and lose their life in doing it. We are going to, as I say, were busy trying to find the centers where these operations stem from, and retaliation will be taken. But were not going to simply kill some people to say, Oh, look, we got even. We want to know when we retaliate that were retaliating with those who are responsible for the terrorist acts. And terrorist acts are such that our own United States Capitol in Washington has been bombed twice.",1984-10-21,Republican
Mr. Newman,"Mr. Trewhitt, your question to President Reagan?",1984-10-21,Moderator

I am not going to exploit, for political purposes, my opponents youth and inexperience. [Laughter and applause] If I still have time, I might add, Mr. Trewhitt, I might add that it was Seneca or it was Cicero, I dont know which, that said, If it was not for the elders correcting the mistakes of the young, there would be no state. Mr. Trewhitt. Mr. President, Id like to head for the fence and try to catch that one before it goes over, but Ill go on to another question.",1984-10-21,Republican
Reagan,"Yes, this had to do with our disarmament talks. And the whole controversy about land missiles came up because we thought that the strategic nuclear weapons, the most destabilizing are the land-based. You put your thumb on a button and somebody blows up 20 minutes later. So, we thought that it would be simpler to negotiate first with those. And then we made it plain, a second phase, take up the submarine-launched or the airborne missiles. But even after we gave in and said, All right, lets discuss it all, they walked away from the table. We didnt.",1984-10-21,Republican
Mr. Mondale,"No. And I have not made it an issue, nor should it be. Whats at issue here is the Presidents application of his authority to understand what a President must know to lead this nation, secure our defense, and make the decisions and the judgments that are necessary. A minute ago the President quoted Cicero, I believe. I want to quote somebody a little closer to home, Harry Truman. He said, The buck stops here. We just heard the Presidents answer for the problems at the barracks in Lebanon, where 241 marines were killed. What happened? First, the Joint Chiefs of Staff went to the President, said, Dont put those troops there. They did it. And then 5 days before the troops were killed, they went back to the President, through the Secretary of Defense, and said, Please, Mr. President, take those troops out of there because we cant defend them. They didnt do it. And we know what happened. After that, once again, our Embassy was exploded. This is the fourth time this has happened  an identical attack, in the same region, despite warnings  even public warnings  from the terrorists. Whos in charge? Whos handling this matter? Thats my main point. Now, on arms control, were completing 4 years. This is the first administration since the bomb went off that made no progress. We have an arms race underway instead. A President has to lead his government or it wont be done. Different people with different views fight with each other. For 3\1/2\ years, this administration avoided arms control, resisted tabling arms control proposals that had any hope of agreeing, rebuked their negotiator in 1981 when he came close to an agreement, at least in principle, on medium-range weapons. And we have this arms race underway. And a recent book that just came out by perhaps the Nations most respected author in this field, Strobe Talbott, called Deadly Gambits, concludes that this President has failed to master the essential details needed to command and lead us, both in terms of security and terms of arms control. Thats why they call the President the Commander in Chief. Good intentions, I grant. But it takes more than that. You must be tough and smart.",1984-10-21,Democrat
Mr. Mondale,"I read his statement the other day. I dont admire Fidel Castro at all. And Ive said that. Che Guevara was a contemptible figure in civilizations history.

Reagan,"Yes. I know itll come as a surprise to Mr. Mondale, but I am in charge. And, as a matter of fact, we havent avoided arms control talks with the Soviet Union. Very early in my administration I proposed  and I think something that had never been proposed by any previous administration  I proposed a total elimination of intermediate-range missiles, where the Soviets had better than a 10  and still have  better than a 10-to-1 advantage over the allies in Europe. When they protested that and suggested a smaller number, perhaps, I went along with that. The so-called negotiation that you said I walked out on was the so-called walk in the woods between one of our representatives and one of the Soviet Union, and it wasnt me that turned it down, the Soviet Union disavowed it.",1984-10-21,Republican

One is Strobe Talbott in his classic book, Deadly Gambits. The other is John Neuhaus, whos one of the most distinguished arms control specialists in our country. Both said that this administration turned down the walk in the woods agreement first, and that would have been a perfect agreement from the standpoint of the United States in Europe and our security. When Mr. Nitze, a good negotiator, returned, he was rebuked, and his boss was fired. This is the kind of leadership that weve had in this administration on the most deadly issue of our times. Now we have a runaway arms race. All theyve got to show for 4 years in U.S.-Soviet relations is one meeting in the last weeks of an administration, and nothing before. Theyre tough negotiators, but all previous Presidents have made progress. This one has not.",1984-10-21,Democrat
Mr. Newman,"Ms. Geyer, your question to Mr. Mondale.",1984-10-21,Moderator
Ms. Geyer,"Mr. Mondale, many analysts are now saying that actually our number one foreign policy problem today is one that remains almost totally unrecognized: massive illegal immigration from economically collapsing countries. They are saying that it is the only real territorial threat to the American nation-state. You, yourself, said in the 1970s that we had a hemorrhage on our borders. Yet today you have backed off any immigration reform, such as the balanced and highly crafted Simpson-Mazzoli bill. Why? What would you do instead today, if anything?",1984-10-21,Moderator
Mr. Mondale,"This is a very serious problem in our country, and it has to be dealt with. I object to that part of the Simpson-Mazzoli bill which I think is very unfair and would prove to be so. That is the part that requires employers to determine the citizenship of an employee before theyre hired. Im convinced that the result of this would be that people who are Hispanic, people who have different languages or speak with an accent, would find it difficult to be employed. I think thats wrong. Weve never had citizenship tests in our country before, and I dont think we should have a citizenship card today. That is counterproductive. I do support the other aspects of the Simpson-Mazzoli bill that strengthen enforcement at the border, strengthen other ways of dealing with undocumented workers in this difficult area and dealing with the problem of settling people who have lived here for many, many years and do not have an established status. I have further strongly recommended that this administration do something it has not done, and that is to strengthen enforcement at the border, strengthen the officials in this government that deal with undocumented workers, and to do so in a way thats responsible and within the Constitution of the United States. We need an answer to this problem, but it must be an American answer that is consistent with justice and due process. Everyone in this room, practically, here tonight, is an immigrant. We came here loving this nation, serving it, and it has served all of our most bountiful dreams. And one of those dreams is justice. And we need a measure  and I will support a measure  that brings about those objectives but avoids that one aspect that I think is very serious. The second part is to maintain and improve relations with our friends to the south. We cannot solve this problem all on our own. And thats why the failure of this administration to deal in an effective and a good-faith way with Mexico, with Costa Rica, with the other nations in trying to find a peaceful settlement to the dispute in Central America has undermined our capacity to effectively deal diplomatically in this area as well.",1984-10-21,Democrat
Ms. Geyer,"Sir, people as well-balanced and just as Father Theodore Hesburgh at Notre Dame, who headed the select commission on immigration, have pointed out repeatedly that there will be no immigration reform without employer sanctions, because it would be an unbalanced bill, and there would be simply no way to enforce it. However, putting that aside for the moment, your critics have also said repeatedly that you have not gone along with the bill or with any immigration reform because of the Hispanic groups  or Hispanic leadership groups  who actually do not represent what the Hispanic-Americans want, because polls show that they overwhelmingly want some kind of immigration reform. Can you say, or how can you justify your position on this? And how do you respond to the criticism that this is another, or that this is an example of your flip-flopping and giving in to special interest groups at the expense of the American nation?",1984-10-21,Moderator
Mr. Mondale,"I think youre right that the polls show that the majority of Hispanics want that bill, so Im not doing it for political reasons. Im doing it because all my life Ive fought for a system of justice in this country, a system in which every American has a chance to achieve the fullness in life without discrimination. This bill imposes upon employers the responsibility of determining whether somebody who applies for a job is an American or not. And just inevitably, theyre going to be reluctant to hire Hispanics or people with a different accent. If I were dealing with politics here, the polls show the American people want this. I am for reform in this area, for tough enforcement at the border, and for many other aspects of the Simpson-Mazzoli bill, but all my life Ive fought for a fair nation. And despite the politics of it, I stand where I stand, and I think Im right, and before this fight is over were going to come up with a better bill, a more effective bill that does not undermine the liberties of our people.",1984-10-21,Democrat
Ms. Geyer,"Mr. President, you, too, have said that our borders are out of control. Yet this fall you allowed the Simpson-Mazzoli bill  which would at least have minimally protected our borders and the rights of citizenship  because of a relatively unimportant issue of reimbursement to the States for legalized aliens. Given that, may I ask what priority can we expect you to give this forgotten national security element? How sincere are you in your efforts to control, in effect, the nation-state that is the United States?",1984-10-21,Moderator
Reagan,"Georgie Anne, we, believe me, supported the Simpson-Mazzoli bill strongly  and the bill that came out of the Senate. However, there were things added in in the House side that we felt made it less of a good bill; as a matter of fact, made it a bad bill. And in conference  we stayed with them in conference all the way to where even Senator Simpson did not want the bill in the manner in which it would come out of the conference committee. There were a number of things in there that weakened that bill. I cant go into detail about them here. But it is true our borders are out of control. It is also true that this has been a situation on our borders back through a number of administrations. And I supported this bill. I believe in the idea of amnesty for those who have put down roots and who have lived here even though sometime back they may have entered illegally. With regard to the employer sanctions, we must have that not only to ensure that we can identify the illegal aliens, but also, while some keep protesting about what it would do to employers, there is another employer that we shouldnt be so concerned about, and these are employers down through the years who have encouraged the illegal entry into this country because they then hire these individuals and hire them at starvation wages and with none of the benefits that we think are normal and natural for workers in our country, and the individuals cant complain because of their illegal status. We dont think that those people should be allowed to continue operating free. And this was why the provisions that we had in with regard to sanctions, and so forth  and Im going to do everything I can, and all of us in the administration are, to join in again when Congress is back at it to get an immigration bill that will give us, once again, control of our borders. And with regard to friendship below the border and with the countries down there, yes, no administration that I know has established the relationship that we have with our Latin friends. But as long as they have an economy that leaves so many people in dire poverty and unemployment, they are going to seek that employment across our borders. And we work with those other countries.",1984-10-21,Republican
Ms. Geyer,"Mr. President, the experts also say that the situation today is terribly different quantitatively  qualitatively different from what it has been in the past because of the gigantic population growth. For instance, Mexicos population will go from about 60 million today to 120 million at the turn of the century. Many of these people will be coming into the United States not as citizens, but as illegal workers. You have repeatedly said recently that you believe that Armageddon, the destruction of the world, may be imminent in our times. Do you ever feel that we are in for an Armageddon or a situation, a time of anarchy, regarding the population explosion in the world?",1984-10-21,Moderator
Reagan,"No. As a matter of fact, the population explosion, if you look at the actual figures, has been vastly exaggerated  over exaggerated. As a matter of fact, there are some pretty scientific and solid figures about how much space there still is in the world and how many more people we can have. Its almost like going back to the Malthusian theory, when even then they were saying that everyone would starve with the limited population they had then. But the problem of population growth is one, here, with regard to our immigration. And we have been the safety valve, whether we wanted to or not, with the illegal entry here, in Mexico, where their population is increasing and they dont have an economy that can absorb them and provide the jobs. And this is what were trying to work out, not only to protect our own borders but to have some kind of fairness and recognition of that problem.",1984-10-21,Republican
Mr. Newman,"Mr. Mondale, your rebuttal?",1984-10-21,Moderator
Mr. Mondale,"One of the biggest problems today is that the countries to our south are so desperately poor that these people who will almost lose their lives if they dont come north, come north despite all the risks. And if were going to find a permanent, fundamental answer to this, it goes to American economic and trade policies that permit these nations to have a chance to get on their own two feet and to get prosperity, so that they can have jobs for themselves and their people. And thats why this enormous national debt, engineered by this administration, is harming these countries in fueling this immigration. These high interest rates  real rates that have doubled under this administration  have had the same effect on Mexico and so on, and the cost of repaying those debts is so enormous that it results in massive unemployment, hardship, and heartache. And that drives our friends to the south up into our region, and we need to end those deficits as well.",1984-10-21,Democrat
Mr. Newman,"Mr. President, your rebuttal.",1984-10-21,Moderator

Mr. Newman,"No applause, please. Mr. Kalb, your question to President Reagan.",1984-10-21,Moderator
Mr. Kalb,"Mr. President, Id like to pick up this Armageddon theme. Youve been quoted as saying that you do believe, deep down, that we are heading for some kind of biblical Armageddon. Your Pentagon and your Secretary of Defense have plans for the United States to fight and prevail in a nuclear war. Do you feel that we are now heading perhaps, for some kind of nuclear Armageddon? And do you feel that this country and the world could survive that kind of calamity?",1984-10-21,Moderator
Reagan,"Mr. Kalb, I think what has been hailed as something Im supposedly, as President, discussing as principle is the recall of just some philosophical discussions with people who are interested in the same things; and that is the prophecies down through the years, the biblical prophecies of what would portend the coming of Armageddon, and so forth, and the fact that a number of theologians for the last decade or more have believed that this was true, that the prophecies are coming together that portend that. But no one knows whether Armageddon, those prophecies mean that Armageddon is a thousand years away or day after tomorrow. So, I have never seriously warned and said we must plan according to Armageddon. Now, with regard to having to say whether we would try to survive in the event of a nuclear war, of course we would. But let me also point out that to several parliaments around the world, in Europe and in Asia, I have made a statement to each one of them, and Ill repeat it here: A nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought. And that is why we are maintaining a deterrent and trying to achieve a deterrent capacity to where no one would believe that they could start such a war and escape with limited damage.",1984-10-21,Republican
Mr. Kalb,"Mr. President, when you made that proposal, the so-called Star Wars proposal, you said, if Im not mistaken, that you would share this very super-sophisticated technology with the Soviet Union. After all of the distrust over the years, sir, that you have expressed towards the Soviet Union, do you really expect anyone to take seriously that offer that you would share the best of Americas technology in this weapons area with our principal adversary?",1984-10-21,Moderator
Reagan,"Why not? What if we did  and I hope we can; were still researching  what if we come up with a weapon that renders those missiles obsolete? There has never been a weapon invented in the history of man that has not led to a defensive, a counterweapon. But suppose we came up with that? Now, some people have said, Ah, that would make war imminent, because they would think that we could launch a first strike because we could defend against the enemy. But why not do what I have offered to do and asked the Soviet Union to do? Say, Look, heres what we can do. Well even give it to you. Now, will you sit down with us and once and for all get rid, all of us, of these nuclear weapons and free mankind from that threat? I think that would be the greatest use of a defensive weapon.",1984-10-21,Republican
Mr. Kalb,"Mr. Mondale, youve been very sharply critical of the Presidents Strategic Defense Initiative. And yet, what is wrong with a major effort by this country to try to use its best technology to knock out as many incoming nuclear warheads as possible?",1984-10-21,Moderator
Mr. Mondale,"First of all, let me sharply disagree with the President on sharing the most advanced, the most dangerous, the most important technology in America with the Soviet Union. We have had for many years, understandably, a system of restraints on high technology because the Soviets are behind us. And any research or development along the Star Wars schemes would inevitably involve our most advanced computers, our most advanced engineering. And the thought that we would share this with the Soviet Union is, in my opinion, a total non-STARTer. I would not let the Soviet Union get their hands on it at all. Now, whats wrong with Star Wars? Theres nothing wrong with the theory of it. If we could develop a principle that would say both sides could fire all their missiles and no one would get hurt, I suppose its a good idea. But the fact of it is were so far away from research that even comes close to that, that the Director of Engineering Research at the Defense Department said to get there we would have to solve eight problems, each of which are more difficult than the atomic bomb and the Manhattan project. It would cost something like a trillion dollars to test and deploy weapons. The second thing is this all assumes that the Soviets wouldnt respond in kind. And they always do. We dont get behind. They wont get behind. And thats been the tragic story of the arms race. We have more at stake in space satellites than they do. If we could stop, right now, the testing and the deployment of these space weapons  and the Presidents proposals go clear beyond research; if it was just research we wouldnt have any argument, because maybe someday, somebody will think of something  but to commit this nation to a buildup of antisatellite and space weapons at this time, in their crude state, would bring about an arms race thats very dangerous indeed. One final point. The most dangerous aspect of this proposal is, for the first time, we would delegate to computers the decision as to whether to start a war. Thats dead wrong. There wouldnt be time for a President to decide; it would be decided by these remote computers. It might be an oil fire, it might be a jet exhaust, the computer might decide its a missile  and off we go.",1984-10-21,Democrat
Mr. Kalb,"Mr. Mondale, in this general area, sir, of arms control, President Carters national security adviser, Zbigniew Brzezinski, said, A nuclear freeze is a hoax. Yet the basis of your arms proposals, as I understand them, is a mutual and verifiable freeze on existing weapons systems. In your view, which specific weapons systems could be subject to a mutual and verifiable freeze, and which could not?",1984-10-21,Moderator
Mr. Mondale,Every system that is verifiable should be placed on the table for negotiations for an agreement. I would not agree to any negotiations or any agreement that involved conduct on the part of the Soviet Union that we couldnt verify every day. I would not agree to any agreement in which the United States security interest was not fully recognized and supported. Thats why we say mutual and verifiable freezes.,1984-10-21,Democrat

Mr. Newman,"President Reagan, your rebuttal?",1984-10-21,Moderator
Reagan,"Yes, my rebuttal, once again, is that this invention that has just been created here of how I would go about rolling over for the Soviet Union  no, Mr. Mondale, my idea would be with that defensive weapon that we would sit down with them and then say, Now, are you willing to join us? Heres what we  give them a demonstration and then say  Heres what we can do. Now, if youre willing to join us in getting rid of all the nuclear weapons in the world, then well give you this one, so that we would both know that no one can cheat; that were both got something that if anyone tries to cheat . . . . But when you keep star-warring it  I never suggested where the weapons should be or what kind; Im not a scientist. I said, and the Joint Chiefs of Staff agreed with me, that it was time for us to turn our research ability to seeing if we could not find this kind of defensive weapon. And suddenly somebody says, Oh, its got to be up there, and its Star Wars, and so forth. I dont know what it would be, but if we can come up with one, I think the world will be better off.",1984-10-21,Republican
Mr. Newman,"Mr. Mondale, your rebuttal.",1984-10-21,Moderator
Mr. Mondale,"Well, thats what a Presidents supposed to know  where those weapons are going to be. If theyre space weapons, I assume theyll be in space. [Laughter] If theyre antisatellite weapons, I assume theyre going to be aimed against satellites. Now, this is the most dangerous technology that we possess. The Soviets try to spy on us, steal this stuff. And to give them technology of this kind, I disagree with. You havent just accepted research, Mr. President. Youve set up a Strategic Defense Initiative, an agency, youre beginning to test, youre talking about deploying, youre asking for a budget of some $30 billion for this purpose. This is an arms escalation. And we will be better off, far better off, if we stop right now, because we have more to lose in space then they do. If someday, somebody comes along with an answer, thats something else. But that there would be an answer in our lifetime is unimaginable. Why do we start things that we know the Soviets will match and make us all less secure? Thats what a Presidents for.",1984-10-21,Democrat
Mr. Newman,"Mr. Kondracke, your question to Mr. Mondale.",1984-10-21,Moderator
Mr. Kondracke,"Mr. Mondale, you say that with respect to the Soviet Union you want to negotiate a mutual nuclear freeze, yet you would unilaterally give up the MX missile and the B  1 bomber before the talks have even begun. And you have announced, in advance, that reaching an agreement with the Soviets is the most important thing in the world to you. Now, arent you giving away half the store before you even sit down to talk?",1984-10-21,Moderator
Mr. Mondale,"No. As a matter of fact, we have a vast range of technology and weaponry right now that provides all the bargaining chips that we need. And I support the air launch cruise missile, the ground launch cruise missile, the Pershing missile, the Trident submarine, the D  5 submarine, Stealth technology, the Midgetman  we have a whole range of technology. Why I disagree with the MX is that its a sitting duck. Itll draw an attack. It puts a hair-trigger, and it is a dangerous, destabilizing weapon. And the B  1 is similarly to be opposed, because for 15 years the Soviet Union has been preparing to meet the B  1. The Secretary of Defense himself said it would be a suicide mission if it were built. Instead, I want to build the Midgetman, which is mobile and thus less vulnerable, contributing to stability, and a weapon that will give us security and contribute to an incentive for arms control. Thats why Im for Stealth technology, to build a Stealth bomber  which Ive supported for years  that can penetrate the Soviet air defense system without any hope that they can perceive where it is because their radar system is frustrated. In other words, a President has to make choices. This makes us stronger. The final point is that we can use this money that we save on these weapons to spend on things that we really need. Our conventional strength in Europe is under strength. We need to strengthen that in order to assure our Western allies of our presence there, a strong defense, but also to diminish and reduce the likelihood of a commencement of a war and the use of nuclear weapons. Its in this way, by making wise choices, that were stronger, we enhance the chances of arms control. Every President until this one has been able to do it, and this nation  or the world is more dangerous as a result.",1984-10-21,Democrat
Mr. Kondracke,"I want to follow up on Mr. Kalbs question. It seems to me on the question of verifiability, that you do have some problems with the extent of the freeze. It seems to me, for example, that testing would be very difficult to verify because the Soviets encode their telemetry. Research would be impossible to verify. Numbers of warheads would be impossible to verify by satellite, except for with onsite inspection, and production of any weapon would be impossible to verify. Now, in view of that, what is going to be frozen?",1984-10-21,Moderator
Mr. Mondale,"I will not agree to any arms control agreement, including a freeze, thats not verifiable. Lets take your warhead principle. The warhead principle  there have been counting rules for years. Whenever a weapon is tested we count the number of warheads on it, and whenever that warhead is used we count that number of warheads, whether they have that number or less on it, or not. These are standard rules. I will not agree to any production restrictions  or agreements, unless we have the ability to verify those agreements. I dont trust the Russians. I believe that every agreement we reach must be verifiable, and I will not agree to anything that we cannot tell every day. In other words, weve got to be tough. But in order to stop this arms madness, weve got to push ahead with tough negotiations that are verifiable so that we know the Soviets are agreeing and living up to their agreement.",1984-10-21,Democrat
Mr. Kondracke,"Mr. President, I want to ask you a question about negotiating with friends. You severely criticized President Carter for helping to undermine two friendly dictators who got into trouble with their own people  the Shah of Iran and President Somoza of Nicaragua. Now there are other such leaders heading for trouble, including President Pinochet of Chile and President Marcos of the Philippines. What should you do, and what can you do to prevent the Philippines from becoming another Nicaragua?",1984-10-21,Moderator
Reagan,"Morton, I did criticize the President because of our undercutting of what was a stalwart ally  the Shah of Iran. And I am not at all convinced that he was that far out of line with his people or that they wanted that to happen. The Shah had done our bidding and carried our load in the Middle East for quite some time, and I did think that it was a blot on our record that we let him down. Have things gotten better? The Shah, whatever he might have done, was building low-cost housing, had taken land away from the Mullahs and was distributing it to the peasants so they could be landowners  things of that kind. But we turned it over to a maniacal fanatic who has slaughtered thousands and thousands of people, calling it executions. The matter of Somoza  no, I never defended Somoza. And, as a matter of fact, the previous administration stood by and so did I  not that I could have done anything in my position at that time  but for this revolution to take place. And the promise of the revolution was democracy, human rights, free labor unions, free press. And then, just as Castro had done in Cuba, the Sandinistas ousted the other parties to the revolution. Many of them are now the contras. They exiled some, they jailed some, they murdered some. And they installed a Marxist-Leninist totalitarian government. And what I have to say about this is, many times  and this has to do with the Philippines, also, I know there are things there in the Philippines that do not look good to us from the standpoint right now of democratic rights, but what is the alternative? It is a large Communist movement to take over the Philippines. They have been our friend since their inception as a nation. And I think that weve had enough of a record of letting  under the guise of revolution  someone that we thought was a little more right than we would be, letting that person go, and then winding up with totalitarianism, pure and simple, as the alternative. And I think that were better off, for example with the Philippines, of trying to retain our friendship and help them right the wrongs we see, rather than throwing them to the wolves and then facing a Communist power in the Pacific.",1984-10-21,Republican
Mr. Kondracke,"Mr. President, since the United States has two strategically important bases in the Philippines, would the overthrow of President Marcos constitute a threat to vital American interests and, if so, what would you do about it?",1984-10-21,Moderator
Reagan,"Well, as I say, we have to look at what an overthrow there would mean and what the government would be that would follow. And there is every evidence, every indication that that government would be hostile to the United States. And that would be a severe blow to our abilities there in the Pacific.",1984-10-21,Republican
Mr. Kondracke,And what would you do about it?,1984-10-21,Moderator
Mr. Newman,"Sorry. Im sorry, youve asked the followup question. Mr. Mondale, your rebuttal?",1984-10-21,Moderator
Mr. Mondale,"Perhaps in no area do we disagree more than this administrations policies on human rights. I went to the Philippines as Vice President, pressed for human rights, called for the release of Aquino, and made progress that had been stalled on both the Subic and the Clark airfield bases. What explains this administration cozying up to the Argentine dictators after they took over? Fortunately, a democracy took over, but this nation was embarrassed by this current administrations adoption of their policies. What happens in South Africa, where, for example, the Nobel Prize winner, 2 days ago, said this administration is seen as working with the oppressive government of South Africa. That hurts this nation. We need to stand for human rights. We need to make it clear were for human liberty. National security and human rights must go together. But this administration time and time again has lost its way in this field.",1984-10-21,Democrat
Mr. Newman,"President Reagan, your rebuttal.",1984-10-21,Moderator
Reagan,"Well, the invasion of Afghanistan didnt take place on our watch. I have described what has happened in Iran, and we werent here then either. I dont think that our record of human rights can be assailed. I think that we have observed, ourselves, and have done our best to see that human rights are extended throughout the world. Mr. Mondale has recently announced a plan of his to get the democracies together and to work with the whole world to turn to democracy. And I was glad to hear him say that, because thats what weve been doing ever since I announced to the British Parliament that I thought we should do this. Human rights are not advanced when, at the same time, you then stand back and say, Whoops, we didnt know the gun was loaded, and you have another totalitarian power on your hands.",1984-10-21,Republican
Mr. Newman,"In this segment, because of the pressure of time, there will be no rebuttals, and there will be no followup questions. Mr. Trewhitt, your question to President Reagan.",1984-10-21,Moderator
Mr. Newman,One question to each candidate.,1984-10-21,Moderator
Reagan,"Well, I cant say that I have roundtabled that and sat down with the Chiefs of Staff, but I have said that it seems to me that this could be a logical step in what is my ultimate goal, my ultimate dream, and that is the elimination of nuclear weapons in the world. And it seems to me that this could be an adjunct, or certainly a great assisting agent in getting that done. I am not going to roll over, as Mr. Mondale suggests, and give them something that could turn around and be used against us. But I think its a very interesting proposal, to see if we can find, first of all, something that renders those weapons obsolete, incapable of their mission. But Mr. Mondale seems to approve MAD  MAD is mutual assured destruction  meaning, if you use nuclear weapons on us, the only thing we have to keep you from doing it is that well kill as many people of yours as youll kill of ours. I think that to do everything we can to find, as I say, something that would destroy weapons and not humans is a great step forward in human rights.",1984-10-21,Republican
Mr. Mondale,"I believe in a sensible arms control approach that brings down these weapons to manageable levels. I would like to see their elimination. And in the meantime, we have to be strong enough to make certain that the Soviet Union never tempts us. Now, here we have to decide between generalized objectives and reality. The President says he wants to eliminate or reduce the number of nuclear weapons. But, in fact, these last 4 years have seen more weapons built, a wider and more vigorous arms race than in human history. He says he wants a system that will make nuclear wars safe, so nobodys going to get hurt. Well, maybe someday, somebody can dream of that.",1984-10-21,Democrat
Mr. Newman,"Please, I must again ask the audience not to applaud, not to cheer, not to demonstrate its feelings in any way.",1984-10-21,Moderator
Mr. Mondale,"I want to thank the League of Women Voters, the good citizens of Kansas City, and President Reagan for agreeing to debate this evening. This evening we talked about national strength. I believe we need to be strong, and I will keep us strong. But I think strength must also require wisdom and smarts in its exercise. Thats key to the strength of our nation. A President must know the essential facts essential to command. But a President must also have a vision of where this nation should go. Tonight, as Americans, you have a choice. And youre entitled to know where we would take this country if you decide to elect us. As President, I would press for long-term, vigorous economic growth. Thats why I want to get these debts down and these interest rates down, restore Americas exports, help rural America, which is suffering so much, and bring the jobs back here for our children. I want this next generation to be the best educated in American history, to invest in the human mind and science again, so were out front. I want this nation to protect its air, its water, its land, and its public health. America is not temporary; were forever. And as Americans, our generation should protect this wonderful land for our children. I want a nation of fairness, where no one is denied the fullness of life or discriminated against, and we deal compassionately with those in our midst who are in trouble. And, above all, I want a nation thats strong. Since we debated 2 weeks ago, the United States and the Soviet Union have built a hundred more warheads, enough to kill millions of Americans and millions of Soviet citizens. This doesnt strengthen us. This weakens the chances of civilization to survive. I remember the night before I became Vice President. I was given the briefing and told that any time, night or day, I might be called upon to make the most fateful decision on Earth  whether to fire these atomic weapons that could destroy the human species. That lesson tells us two things: One, pick a President that you know will know if that tragic moment ever comes what he must know, because therell be no time for staffing committees or advisers. A President must know right then. But above all, pick a President who will fight to avoid the day when that God-awful decision ever needs to be made. And thats why this election is so terribly important. America and Americans decide not just whats happening in this country. We are the strongest and most powerful free society on Earth. When you make that judgment, you are deciding not only the future of our nation; in a very profound respect, youre deciding the future of the world. We need to move on. Its time for America to find new leadership. Please, join me in this cause to move confidently and with a sense of assurance and command to build the blessed future of our nation.",1984-10-21,Democrat
Mr. Newman,"President Reagan, your summation, please.",1984-10-21,Moderator
Reagan,"Yes. My thanks to the League of Women Voters, to the panelists, the moderator, and to the people of Kansas City for their warm hospitality and greeting. I think the American people tonight have much to be grateful for  an economic recovery that has become expansion, freedom and, most of all, we are at peace. I am grateful for the chance to reaffirm my commitment to reduce nuclear weapons and, one day, to eliminate them entirely. We shouldnt be dwelling on the past, or even the present. The meaning of this election is the future and whether were going to grow and provide the jobs and the opportunities for all Americans and that they need. Several years ago, I was given an assignment to write a letter. It was to go into a time capsule and would be read in 100 years when that time capsule was opened. I remember driving down the California coast one day. My mind was full of what I was going to put in that letter about the problems and the issues that confront us in our time and what we did about them. But I couldnt completely neglect the beauty around me  the Pacific out there on one side of the highway, shining in the sunlight, the mountains of the coast range rising on the other side. And I found myself wondering what it would be like for someone  wondering if someone 100 years from now would be driving down that highway, and if they would see the same thing. And with that thought, I realized what a job I had with that letter. I would be writing a letter to people who know everything there is to know about us. We know nothing about them. They would know all about our problems. They would know how we solved them, and whether our solution was beneficial to them down through the years or whether it hurt them. They would also know that we lived in a world with terrible weapons, nuclear weapons of terrible destructive power, aimed at each other, capable of crossing the ocean in a matter of minutes and destroying civilization as we knew it. And then I thought to myself, what are they going to say about us, what are those people 100 years from now going to think? They will know whether we used those weapons or not. Well, what they will say about us 100 years from now depends on how we keep our rendezvous with destiny. Will we do the things that we know must be done and know that one day, down in history 100 years or perhaps before, someone will say, Thank God for those people back in the 1980s for preserving our freedom, for saving for us this blessed planet called Earth, with all its grandeur and its beauty. You know, I am grateful to all of you for giving me the opportunity to serve you for these 4 years, and I seek reelection because I want more than anything else to try to complete the new beginning that we charted 4 years ago. George Bush, who I think is one of the finest Vice Presidents this country has ever had  George Bush and I have crisscrossed the country, and weve had, in these last few months, a wonderful experience. We have met young America. We have met your sons and daughters.",1984-10-21,Republican

Lehrer,"This debate and the next three  two presidential, one vice presidential  are sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates. Tonights 90 minutes will be about domestic issues and will follow a format designed by the commission. There will be six roughly 15-minute segments with two-minute answers for the first question, then open discussion for the remainder of each segment. Thousands of people offered suggestions on segment subjects or questions via the Internet and other means, but I made the final selections. And for the record, they were not submitted for approval to the commission or the candidates. The segments as I announced in advance will be three on the economy and one each on health care, the role of government and governing, with an emphasis throughout on differences, specifics and choices. Both candidates will also have two-minute closing statements.

Lehrer,"You have two minutes. Each of you have two minutes to start. A coin toss has determined, Mr. President, you go first.",2012-10-03,Moderator
Obama,"Well, thank you very much, Jim, for this opportunity. I want to thank Governor Romney and the University of Denver for your hospitality. There are a lot of points I want to make tonight, but the most important one is that 20 years ago I became the luckiest man on Earth because Michelle Obama agreed to marry me. And so I just want to wish, Sweetie, you happy anniversary and let you know that a year from now we will not be celebrating it in front of 40 million people. You know, four years ago we went through the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. Millions of jobs were lost, the auto industry was on the brink of collapse. The financial system had frozen up. And because of the resilience and the determination of the American people, weve begun to fight our way back. Over the last 30 months, weve seen 5 million jobs in the private sector created. The auto industry has come roaring back. And housing has begun to rise. But we all know that weve still got a lot of work to do. And so the question here tonight is not where weve been, but where were going. Governor Romney has a perspective that says if we cut taxes, skewed towards the wealthy, and roll back regulations, that well be better off. Ive got a different view. I think weve got to invest in education and training. I think its important for us to develop new sources of energy here in America, that we change our tax code to make sure that were helping small businesses and companies that are investing here in the United States, that we take some of the money that were saving as we wind down two wars to rebuild America and that we reduce our deficit in a balanced way that allows us to make these critical investments. Now, it ultimately is going to be up to the voters  to you  which path we should take. Are we going to double on top-down economic policies that helped to get us into this mess or do we embrace a new economic patriotism that says America does best when the middle class does best? And Im looking forward to having that debate.",2012-10-03,Democrat
Lehrer,"Governor Romney, two minutes.",2012-10-03,Moderator
Romney,"Thank you, Jim. Its an honor to be here with you, and I appreciate the chance to be with the president. Im pleased to be at the University of Denver, appreciate their welcome, and also the Presidential Commission on these debates. Congratulations. And the answer is, yes, we can help, but its going to take a different path. Not the one weve been on, not the one the president describes as a top-down, cut taxes for the rich. Thats not what Im going to do. My plan has five basic parts. One, get us energy independent, North American energy independent. That creates about 4 million jobs. Number two, open up more trade, particularly in Latin America. Crack down on China, if and when they cheat. Number three, make sure our people have the skills they need to succeed and the best schools in the world. Were far away from that now. Number four, get to us a balanced budget. Number five, champion small business. Its small business that creates the jobs in America, and over the last four years, small business people have decided that America may not be the place to open a new business because new business startups are down to a 30-year low.",2012-10-03,Republican
Romney,"Now, Im concerned that the path that were on has just been unsuccessful. The president has a view very similar to the view he had when he ran four years, that a bigger government, spending more, taxing more, regulating more  if you will, trickle-down government  would work. Thats not the right answer for America. Ill restore the vitality that gets America working again. Thank you.",2012-10-03,Republican
Lehrer,"Mr. President, please respond directly to what the governor just said about trickle-down  his trick-down approach, as he said yours is.",2012-10-03,Moderator
Obama,"Well, let me talk specifically about what I think we need to do. First, weve got to improve our education system and weve made enormous progress drawing on ideas both from Democrats and Republicans that are already starting to show gains in some of the toughest to deal with schools. Weve got a program called Race to the Top that has prompted reforms in 46 states around the country, raising standards, improving how we train teachers. So now I want to hire another 100,000 new math and science teachers, and create 2 million more slots in our community colleges so that people can get trained for the jobs that are out there right now. And I want to make sure that we keep tuition low for our young people. When it comes to our tax code, Governor Romney and I both agree that our corporate tax rate is too high, so I want to lower it, particularly for manufacturing, taking it down to 25 percent. But I also want to close those loopholes that are giving incentives for companies that are shipping jobs overseas. I want to provide tax breaks for companies that are investing here in the United States. On energy, Governor Romney and I, we both agree that weve got to boost American energy production, and oil and natural gas production are higher than theyve been in years. But I also believe that weve got to look at the energy sources of the future, like wind and solar and biofuels, and make those investments.",2012-10-03,Democrat
Obama,"So all of this is possible. Now, in order for us to do it, we do have to close our deficit, and one of the things Im sure well be discussing tonight is, how do we deal with our tax code? And how do we make sure that we are reducing spending in a responsible way, but also, how do we have enough revenue to make those investments? And this is where theres a difference, because Governor Romneys central economic plan calls for a $5 trillion tax cut  on top of the extension of the Bush tax cuts  thats another trillion dollars  and $2 trillion in additional military spending that the military hasnt asked for. Thats $8 trillion. How we pay for that, reduce the deficit, and make the investments that we need to make, without dumping those costs onto middle-class Americans, I think is one of the central questions of this campaign.",2012-10-03,Democrat
Lehrer,"Both of you have spoken about a lot of different things, and were going to try to get through them in as specific a way as we possibly can.",2012-10-03,Moderator
Romney,"Well, sure. Id like to clear up the record and go through it piece by piece. First of all, I dont have a $5 trillion tax cut. I dont have a tax cut of a scale that youre talking about. My view is that we ought to provide tax relief to people in the middle class. But Im not going to reduce the share of taxes paid by high-income people. High-income people are doing just fine in this economy. Theyll do fine whether youre president or I am. The people who are having the hard time right now are middle- income Americans. Under the presidents policies, middle-income Americans have been buried. Theyre just being crushed. Middle- income Americans have seen their income come down by $4,300. This is a  this is a tax in and of itself. Ill call it the economy tax. Its been crushing. At the same time, gasoline prices have doubled under the president. Electric rates are up. Food prices are up. Health care costs have gone up by $2,500 a family. Middle-income families are being crushed.",2012-10-03,Republican
Romney,"And so the question is how to get them going again. And Ive described it. Its energy and trade, the right kind of training programs, balancing our budget and helping small business. Those are the  the cornerstones of my plan. But the president mentioned a couple of other ideas Ill just note. First, education. I agree: Education is key, particularly the future of our economy. But our training programs right now, weve got 47 of them, housed in the federal government, reporting to eight different agencies. Overhead is overwhelming. Weve got to get those dollars back to the states and go to the workers so they can create their own pathways to get in the training they need for jobs that will really help them. The second area, taxation, we agree, we ought to bring the tax rates down. And I do, both for corporations and for individuals. But in order for us not to lose revenue, have the government run out of money, I also lower deductions and credits and exemptions, so that we keep taking in the same money when you also account for growth. The third area, energy. Energy is critical, and the president pointed out correctly that production of oil and gas in the U.S. is up. But not due to his policies. In spite of his policies. Mr. President, all of the increase in natural gas and oil has happened on private land, not on government land. On government land, your administration has cut the number of permits and licenses in half. If Im president, Ill double them, and also get the  the oil from offshore and Alaska. And Ill bring that pipeline in from Canada. And, by the way, I like coal. Im going to make sure we can continue to burn clean coal. People in the coal industry feel like its getting crushed by your policies. I want to get America and North America energy independent so we can create those jobs. And finally, with regards to that tax cut, look, Im not looking to cut massive taxes and to reduce the  the revenues going to the government. My  my number-one principal is, there will be no tax cut that adds to the deficit. I want to underline that: no tax cut that adds to the deficit.",2012-10-03,Republican
Obama,"Well, I think  lets talk about taxes, because I think its instructive. Now, four years ago, when I stood on this stage, I said that I would cut taxes for middle-class families. And thats exactly what I did. We cut taxes for middle-class families by about $3,600. And the reason is, because I believe that we do best when the middle class is doing well. And by giving them those tax cuts, they had a little more money in their pocket, and so maybe they can buy a new car. They are certainly in a better position to weather the extraordinary recession that we went through. They can buy a computer for their kid whos going off to college, which means theyre spending more money, businesses have more customers, businesses make more profits, and then hire more workers. Now, Governor Romneys proposal that he has been promoting for 18 months calls for a $5 trillion tax cut, on top of $2 trillion of additional spending for our military. And he is saying that he is going to pay for it by closing loopholes and deductions. The problem is that hes been asked over 100 times how you would close those deductions and loopholes, and he hasnt been able to identify them. But Im going to make an important point here, Jim.",2012-10-03,Democrat
Lehrer,All right.,2012-10-03,Moderator

Romney,"So if the tax plan he described were a tax plan I was asked to support, Id say absolutely not. Im not looking for a $5 trillion tax cut. What Ive said is I wont put in place a tax cut that adds to the deficit. Thats part one. So theres no economist that can say Mitt Romneys tax plan adds $5 trillion if I say I will not add to the deficit with my tax plan. Number two, I will not reduce the share paid by high-income individuals. I know that you and your running mate keep saying that and I know its a popular thing to say with a lot of people, but its just not the case. Look, Ive got five boys. Im used to people saying something thats not always true, but just keep on repeating it and ultimately hoping Ill believe it. But that  that is not the case. All right? I will not reduce the taxes paid by high-income Americans. And number three, I will not under any circumstances raise taxes on middle-income families. I will lower taxes on middle-income families. Now, you cite a study. There are six other studies that looked at the study you describe and say its completely wrong. I saw a study that came out today that said youre going to raise taxes by $3,000 to $4,000 on middle-income families.",2012-10-03,Republican
Romney,"And the reason is because small business pays that individual rate; 54 percent of Americas workers work in businesses that are taxed not at the corporate tax rate, but at the individual tax rate. And if we lower that rate, they will be able to hire more people. For me, this is about jobs. This is about getting jobs for the American people.",2012-10-03,Republican
Lehrer,Thats where we started. Yeah.,2012-10-03,Moderator
Obama,"Well, for 18 months hes been running on this tax plan. And now, five weeks before the election, hes saying that his big, bold idea is, Never mind. And the fact is that if you are lowering the rates the way you described, Governor, then it is not possible to come up with enough deductions and loopholes that only affect high-income individuals to avoid either raising the deficit or burdening the middle class. Its  its math. Its arithmetic. Now, Governor Romney and I do share a deep interest in encouraging small-business growth. So at the same time that my tax plan has already lowered taxes for 98 percent of families, I also lowered taxes for small businesses 18 times. And what I want to do is continue the tax rates  the tax cuts that we put into place for small businesses and families. But I have said that for incomes over $250,000 a year, that we should go back to the rates that we had when Bill Clinton was president, when we created 23 million new jobs, went from deficit to surplus, and created a whole lot of millionaires to boot. And the reason this is important is because by doing that, we cannot only reduce the deficit, we cannot only encourage job growth through small businesses, but were also able to make the investments that are necessary in education or in energy.",2012-10-03,Democrat
Obama,"And we do have a difference, though, when it comes to definitions of small business. Under  under my plan, 97 percent of small businesses would not see their income taxes go up. Governor Romney says, well, those top 3 percent, theyre the job creators, theyd be burdened. But under Governor Romneys definition, there are a whole bunch of millionaires and billionaires who are small businesses. Donald Trump is a small business. Now, I know Donald Trump doesnt like to think of himself as small anything, but  but thats how you define small businesses if youre getting business income. And that kind of approach, I believe, will not grow our economy, because the only way to pay for it without either burdening the middle class or blowing up our deficit is to make drastic cuts in things like education, making sure that we are continuing to invest in basic science and research, all the things that are helping America grow.

Romney,"You bet. Well, President, youre  Mr. President, youre absolutely right, which is that, with regards to 97 percent of the businesses are not  not taxed at the 35 percent tax rate, theyre taxed at a lower rate. But those businesses that are in the last 3 percent of businesses happen to employ half  half of all the people who work in small business. Those are the businesses that employ one-quarter of all the workers in America. And your plan is to take their tax rate from 35 percent to 40 percent. Now, and  and Ive talked to a guy who has a very small business. Hes in the electronics business in  in St. Louis. He has four employees. He said he and his son calculated how much they pay in taxes, federal income tax, federal payroll tax, state income tax, state sales tax, state property tax, gasoline tax. It added up to well over 50 percent of what they earned. And your plan is to take the tax rate on successful small businesses from 35 percent to 40 percent. The National Federation of Independent Businesses has said that will cost 700,000 jobs. I dont want to cost jobs. My priority is jobs. And so what I do is I bring down the tax rates, lower deductions and exemptions, the same idea behind Bowles-Simpson, by the way, get the rates down, lower deductions and exemptions, to create more jobs, because theres nothing better for getting us to a balanced budget than having more people working, earning more money, paying more taxes. Thats by far the most effective and efficient way to get this budget balanced.",2012-10-03,Republican

If you believe that we can cut taxes by $5 trillion and add $2 trillion in additional spending that the military is not asking for, $7 trillion  just to give you a sense, over 10 years, thats more than our entire defense budget  and you think that by closing loopholes and deductions for the well-to-do, somehow you will not end up picking up the tab, then Governor Romneys plan may work for you. But I think math, common sense, and our history shows us thats not a recipe for job growth. Look, weve tried this. Weve tried both approaches. The approach that Governor Romneys talking about is the same sales pitch that was made in 2001 and 2003, and we ended up with the slowest job growth in 50 years, we ended up moving from surplus to deficits, and it all culminated in the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.",2012-10-03,Democrat

So, in some ways, weve got some data on which approach is more likely to create jobs and opportunity for Americans and I believe that the economy works best when middle-class families are getting tax breaks so that theyve got some money in their pockets, and those of us who have done extraordinarily well because of this magnificent country that we live in, that we can afford to do a little bit more to make sure were not blowing up the deficit.",2012-10-03,Democrat

Romney,"I think first of all, let me  let me repeat  let me repeat what I said. Im not in favor of a $5 trillion tax cut. Thats not my plan. My plan is not to put in place any tax cut that will add to the deficit. Thats point one. So you may keep referring to it as a $5 trillion tax cut, but thats not my plan. Number two, lets look at history. My plan is not like anything thats been tried before. My plan is to bring down rates, but also bring down deductions and exemptions and credits at the same time so the revenue stays in, but that we bring down rates to get more people working. My priority is putting people back to work in America. Theyre suffering in this country. And we talk about evidence. Look at the evidence of the last four years. Its absolutely extraordinary. Weve got 23 million people out of work or stopped looking for work in this country. Its just  its  weve got  when the president took office, 32 million people on food stamps; 47 million on food stamps today; economic growth this year slower than last year, and last year slower than the year before. Going forward with the status quo is not going to cut it for the American people who are struggling today.",2012-10-03,Republican

Romney,"Good. Im glad you raised that, and its a  its a critical issue. I think its not just an economic issue, I think its a moral issue. I think its, frankly, not moral for my generation to keep spending massively more than we take in, knowing those burdens are going to be passed on to the next generation and theyre going to be paying the interest and the principal all their lives. And the amount of debt were adding, at a trillion a year, is simply not moral. So how do we deal with it? Well, mathematically, there are three ways that you can cut a deficit. One, of course, is to raise taxes. Number two is to cut spending. And number is to grow the economy, because if more people work in a growing economy, theyre paying taxes, and you can get the job done that way. The presidents would  president would prefer raising taxes. I understand. The problem with raising taxes is that it slows down the rate of growth. And you could never quite get the job done. I want to lower spending and encourage economic growth at the same time. What things would I cut from spending? Well, first of all, I will eliminate all programs by this test, if they dont pass it: Is the program so critical its worth borrowing money from China to pay for it? And if not, Ill get rid of it.

Number two, Ill take programs that are currently good programs but I think could be run more efficiently at the state level and send them to the state.",2012-10-03,Republican
Romney,"Number three, Ill make government more efficient and to cut back the number of employees, combine some agencies and departments. My cutbacks will be done through attrition, by the way. This is the approach we have to take to get America to a balanced budget. The president said hed cut the deficit in half. Unfortunately, he doubled it. Trillion-dollar deficits for the last four years. The presidents put it in place as much public debt  almost as much debt held by the public as al prior presidents combined.",2012-10-03,Republican

Obama,"When I walked into the Oval Office, I had more than a trillion-dollar deficit greeting me. And we know where it came from: two wars that were paid for on a credit card; two tax cuts that were not paid for; and a whole bunch of programs that were not paid for; and then a massive economic crisis. And despite that, what weve said is, yes, we had to take some initial emergency measures to make sure we didnt slip into a Great Depression, but what weve also said is, lets make sure that we are cutting out those things that are not helping us grow. So 77 government programs, everything from aircrafts that the Air Force had ordered but werent working very well, 18 government  18 government programs for education that were well-intentioned, not werent helping kids learn, we went after medical fraud in Medicare and Medicaid very aggressively, more aggressively than ever before, and have saved tens of billions of dollars, $50 billion of waste taken out of the system. And I worked with Democrats and Republicans to cut a trillion dollars out of our discretionary domestic budget. Thats the largest cut in the discretionary domestic budget since Dwight Eisenhower. Now, we all know that weve got to do more. And so Ive put forward a specific $4 trillion deficit reduction plan. Its on a website. You can look at all the numbers, what cuts we make and what revenue we raise. And the way we do it is $2.50 for every cut, we ask for $1 of additional revenue, paid for, as I indicated earlier, by asking those of us who have done very well in this country to contribute a little bit more to reduce the deficit. Governor Romney earlier mentioned the Bowles-Simpson commission. Well, thats how the commission  bipartisan commission that talked about how we should move forward suggested we have to do it, in a balanced way with some revenue and some spending cuts. And this is a major difference that Governor Romney and I have. Let  let me just finish their point, because youre looking for contrast. You know, when Governor Romney stood on a stage with other Republican candidates for the nomination and he was asked, would you take $10 of spending cuts for just $1 of revenue?

You found $4 trillion of ways to reduce or to get closer to a balanced budget, except we still show trillion-dollar deficits every year. That doesnt get the job done. Let me come back and say, why is it that I dont want to raise taxes? Why dont I want to raise taxes on people? And actually, you said it back in 2010. You said, Look, Im going to extend the tax policies that we have now; Im not going to raise taxes on anyone, because when the economy is growing slow like this, when were in recession, you shouldnt raise taxes on anyone. Well, the economy is still growing slow. As a matter of fact, its growing much more slowly now than when you made that statement. And so if you believe the same thing, you just dont want to raise taxes on people. And the reality is its not just wealthy people  you mentioned Donald Trump. Its not just Donald Trump youre taxing. Its all those businesses that employ one-quarter of the workers in America; these small businesses that are taxed as individuals. You raise taxes and you kill jobs.

Obama,"If  if were serious, weve got to take a balanced, responsible approach. And by the way, this is not just when it comes to individual taxes. Lets talk about corporate taxes. Now, Ive identified areas where we can, right away, make a change that I believe would actually help the economy. The oil industry gets $4 billion a year in corporate welfare. Basically, they get deductions that those small businesses that Governor Romney refers to, they dont get. Now, does anybody think that ExxonMobil needs some extra money, when theyre making money every time you go to the pump? Why wouldnt we want to eliminate that? Why wouldnt we eliminate tax breaks for corporate jets? My attitude is, if you got a corporate jet, you can probably afford to pay full freight, not get a special break for it. When it comes to corporate taxes, Governor Romney has said he wants to, in a revenue neutral way, close loopholes, deductions  he hasnt identified which ones they are  but that thereby bring down the corporate rate. Well, I want to do the same thing, but Ive actually identified how we can do that. And part of the way to do it is to not give tax breaks to companies that are shipping jobs overseas. Right now, you can actually take a deduction for moving a plant overseas. I think most Americans would say that doesnt make sense. And all that raises revenue. And so if we take a balanced approach, what that then allows us to do is also to help young people, the way we already have during my administration, make sure that they can afford to go to college.",2012-10-03,Democrat

The first two weeks shes got them, some of them sitting on the floor until finally they get reassigned. Theyre using text books that are 10 years old. That is not a recipe for growth. Thats not how America was built. And so budgets reflect choices. Ultimately, were going to have to make some decisions. And if were asking for no revenue, then that means that weve got to get rid of a whole bunch of stuff. And the magnitude of the tax cuts that youre talking about, Governor, would end up resulting in severe hardship for people, but more importantly, would not help us grow. As I indicated before, when you talk about shifting Medicaid to states, were talking about potentially a 30  a 30 percent cut in Medicaid over time. Now, you know, that may not seem like a big deal when it just is, you know, numbers on a sheet of paper, but if were talking about a family whos got an autistic kid and is depending on that Medicaid, thats a big problem.

And I remember, as a governor, when this idea was floated by Tommy Thompson, the governors  Republican and Democrats  said, please let us do that. We can care for our own poor in so much better and more effective a way than having the federal government tell us how to care for our poor. So  so lets state  one of the magnificent things about this country is the whole idea that states are the laboratories of democracy.

Obama,"You know, I suspect that, on Social Security, weve got a somewhat similar position. Social Security is structurally sound. Its going to have to be tweaked the way it was by Ronald Reagan and Speaker  Democratic Speaker Tip ONeill. But it is  the basic structure is sound. But  but I want to talk about the values behind Social Security and Medicare, and then talk about Medicare, because thats the big driver of our deficits right now. You know, my grandmother  some of you know  helped to raise me. My grandparents did. My grandfather died a while back. My grandmother died three days before I was elected president. And she was fiercely independent. She worked her way up, only had a high school education, started as a secretary, ended up being the vice president of a local bank. And she ended up living alone by choice. And the reason she could be independent was because of Social Security and Medicare. She had worked all her life, put in this money, and understood that there was a basic guarantee, a floor under which she could not go. And thats the perspective I bring when I think about whats called entitlements. You know, the name itself implies some sense of dependency on the part of these folks. These are folks whove worked hard, like my grandmother, and there are millions of people out there who are counting on this.",2012-10-03,Democrat
Obama,"So my approach is to say, how do we strengthen the system over the long term? And in Medicare, what we did was we said, we are going to have to bring down the costs if were going to deal with our long-term deficits, but to do that, lets look where some of the moneys going. $716 billion we were able to save from the Medicare program by no longer overpaying insurance companies by making sure that we werent overpaying providers. And using that money, we were actually able to lower prescription drug costs for seniors by an average of $600, and we were also able to make a  make a significant dent in providing them the kind of preventive care that will ultimately save money through the  throughout the system. So the way for us to deal with Medicare in particular is to lower health care costs. When it comes to Social Security, as I said, you dont need a major structural change in order to make sure that Social Security is there for the future.",2012-10-03,Democrat
Lehrer,"Well follow up on this. First, Governor Romney, you have two minutes on Social Security and entitlements.",2012-10-03,Moderator
Romney,"Well, Jim, our seniors depend on these programs, and I know anytime we talk about entitlements, people become concerned that somethings going to happen thats going to change their life for the worse. And the answer is neither the president nor I are proposing any changes for any current retirees or near retirees, either to Social Security or Medicare. So if youre 60 or around 60 or older, you dont need to listen any further. But for younger people, we need to talk about what changes are going to be occurring. Oh, I just thought about one. And that is, in fact, I was wrong when I said the president isnt proposing any changes for current retirees. In fact he is on Medicare. On Social Security hes not. But on Medicare, for current retirees, hes cutting $716 billion from the program. Now, he says by not overpaying hospitals and providers. Actually just going to them and saying, Were going to reduce the rates you get paid across the board, everybodys going to get a lower rate. Thats not just going after places where theres abuse. Thats saying were cutting the rates. Some 15 percent of hospitals and nursing homes say they wont take anymore Medicare patients under that scenario. We also have 50 percent of doctors who say they wont take more Medicare patients. This  we have 4 million people on Medicare Advantage that will lose Medicare Advantage because of those $716 billion in cuts. I cant understand how you can cut Medicare $716 billion for current recipients of Medicare. Now, you point out, well, were putting some back. Were going to give a better prescription program. Thats $1  thats $1 for every $15 youve cut. Theyre smart enough to know thats not a good trade. I want to take that $716 billion youve cut and put it back into Medicare. By the way, we can include a prescription program if we need to improve it. But the idea of cutting $716 billion from Medicare to be able to balance the additional cost of Obamacare is, in my opinion, a mistake. And with regards to young people coming along, Ive got proposals to make sure Medicare and Social Security are there for them without any question.",2012-10-03,Republican

Obama,"For  so if youre  if youre 54 or 55, you might want to listen cause this  this will affect you. The idea, which was originally presented by Congressman Ryan, your running mate, is that we would give a voucher to seniors and they could go out in the private marketplace and buy their own health insurance. The problem is that because the voucher wouldnt necessarily keep up with health care inflation, it was estimated that this would cost the average senior about $6,000 a year. Now, in fairness, what Governor Romney has now said is hell maintain traditional Medicare alongside it. But theres still a problem, because what happens is, those insurance companies are pretty clever at figuring out who are the younger and healthier seniors. They recruit them, leaving the older, sicker seniors in Medicare. And every health care economist that looks at it says, over time, whatll happen is the traditional Medicare system will collapse.",2012-10-03,Democrat
Obama,"And then what youve got is folks like my grandmother at the mercy of the private insurance system precisely at the time when they are most in need of decent health care. So, I dont think vouchers are the right way to go. And this is not my own  only my opinion. AARP thinks that the  the savings that we obtained from Medicare bolster the system, lengthen the Medicare trust fund by eight years. Benefits were not affected at all. And ironically, if you repeal Obamacare, and I have become fond of this term, Obamacare, if you repeal it, what happens is those seniors right away are going to be paying $600 more in prescription care. Theyre now going to have to be paying copays for basic checkups that can keep them healthier. And the primary beneficiary of that repeal are insurance companies that are estimated to gain billions of dollars back when they arent making seniors any healthier. And I dont think thats the right approach when it comes to making sure that Medicare is stronger over the long term.",2012-10-03,Democrat
Lehrer,"Well talk about  specifically about health care in a moment. But what  do you support the voucher system, Governor?",2012-10-03,Moderator
Romney,What I support is no change for current retirees and near-retirees to Medicare. And the president supports taking $716 billion out of that program.,2012-10-03,Republican
Lehrer,And what about the vouchers?,2012-10-03,Moderator
Romney,"So thats  thats number one. Number two is for people coming along that are young, what I do to make sure that we can keep Medicare in place for them is to allow them either to choose the current Medicare program or a private plan. Their choice. They get to choose  and theyll have at least two plans that will be entirely at no cost to them. So they dont have to pay additional money, no additional $6,000. Thats not going to happen. Theyll have at least two plans.",2012-10-03,Republican
Romney,"And by the way, if the government can be as efficient as the private sector and offer premiums that are as low as the private sector, people will be happy to get traditional Medicare or theyll be able to get a private plan. I know my own view is Id rather have a private plan. Id just assume not have the government telling me what kind of health care I get. Id rather be able to have an insurance company. If I dont like them, I can get rid of them and find a different insurance company. But people make their own choice. The other thing we have to do to save Medicare? We have to have the benefits high for those that are low income, but for higher income people, were going to have to lower some of the benefits. We have to make sure this program is there for the long term. Thats the plan that Ive put forward. And, by the way the idea came not even from Paul Ryan or  or Senator Wyden, whos the co-author of the bill with  with Paul Ryan in the Senate, but also it came from Bill  Bill Clintons chief of staff. This is an idea thats been around a long time, which is saying, hey, lets see if we cant get competition into the Medicare world so that people can get the choice of different plans at lower cost, better quality. I believe in competition.",2012-10-03,Republican
Obama,"Jim, if I  if I can just respond very quickly, first of all, every study has shown that Medicare has lower administrative costs than private insurance does, which is why seniors are generally pretty happy with it. And private insurers have to make a profit. Nothing wrong with that. Thats what they do. And so youve got higher administrative costs, plus profit on top of that. And if you are going to save any money through what Governor Romneys proposing, what has to happen is, is that the money has to come from somewhere. And when you move to a voucher system, you are putting seniors at the mercy of those insurance companies. And over time, if traditional Medicare has decayed or fallen apart, then theyre stuck. And this is the reason why AARP has said that your plan would weaken Medicare substantially. And thats why they were supportive of the approach that we took. One last point I want to make. We do have to lower the cost of health care, not just in Medicare and Medicaid LEHRER: Talk about that in a minute.",2012-10-03,Democrat

Romney,"Regulation is essential. You cant have a free market work if you dont have regulation. As a businessperson, I had to have  I need to know the regulations. I needed them there. You couldnt have people opening up banks in their  in their garage and making loans. I mean, you have to have regulations so that you can have an economy work. Every free economy has good regulation.

And whats happened with some of the legislation thats been passed during the presidents term, youve seen regulation become excessive, and its hurt  its hurt the economy. Let me give you an example. Dodd-Frank was passed. And it includes within it a number of provisions that I think has some unintended consequences that are harmful to the economy. One is it designates a number of banks as too big to fail, and theyre effectively guaranteed by the federal government. This is the biggest kiss thats been given to  to New York banks Ive ever seen. This is an enormous boon for them. Thereve been 122 community and small banks have closed since Dodd- Frank.",2012-10-03,Republican

Romney,But lets  lets mention  let me mention the other one. Lets talk,2012-10-03,Republican
Lehrer,"No, lets not. Lets let him respond  lets let him respond to this specific on Dodd-Frank and what the governor just said.",2012-10-03,Moderator
Obama,"I think this is a great example. The reason we have been in such a enormous economic crisis was prompted by reckless behavior across the board. Now, it wasnt just on Wall Street. You had loan officers were  that were giving loans and mortgages that really shouldnt have been given, because the folks didnt qualify. You had people who were borrowing money to buy a house that they couldnt afford. You had credit agencies that were stamping these as A1 great investments when they werent. But you also had banks making money hand over fist, churning out products that the bankers themselves didnt even understand, in order to make big profits, but knowing that it made the entire system vulnerable. So what did we do? We stepped in and had the toughest reforms on Wall Street since the 1930s. We said youve got  banks, youve got to raise your capital requirements. You cant engage in some of this risky behavior that is putting Main Street at risk. Weve going to make sure that youve got to have a living will so  so we can know how youre going to wind things down if you make a bad bet so we dont have other taxpayer bailouts.",2012-10-03,Democrat
Obama,"In the meantime, by the way, we also made sure that all the help that we provided those banks was paid back every single dime, with interest. Now, Governor Romney has said he wants to repeal Dodd-Frank. And, you know, I appreciate and it appears weve got some agreement that a marketplace to work has to have some regulation. But in the past, Governor Romney has said he just want to repeal Dodd- Frank, roll it back. And so the question is: Does anybody out there think that the big problem we had is that there was too much oversight and regulation of Wall Street? Because if you do, then Governor Romney is your candidate. But thats not what I believe.",2012-10-03,Democrat
Romney,"Sorry, but thats just not  thats just not the facts. Look, we have to have regulation on Wall Street. Thats why Id have regulation. But I wouldnt designate five banks as too big to fail and give them a blank check. Thats one of the unintended consequences of Dodd-Frank. It wasnt thought through properly. We need to get rid of that provision because its killing regional and small banks. Theyre getting hurt. Let me mention another regulation in Dodd-Frank. You say we were giving mortgages to people who werent qualified. Thats exactly right. Its one of the reasons for the great financial calamity we had. And so Dodd-Frank correctly says we need to have qualified mortgages, and if you give a mortgage thats not qualified, there are big penalties, except they didnt ever go on and define what a qualified mortgage was. Its been two years. We dont know what a qualified mortgage is yet. So banks are reluctant to make loans, mortgages. Try and get a mortgage these days. Its hurt the housing market because Dodd-Frank didnt anticipate putting in place the kinds of regulations you have to have. Its not that Dodd-Frank always was wrong with too much regulation. Sometimes they didnt come out with a clear regulation. I will make sure we dont hurt the functioning of our  of our marketplace and our business, because I want to bring back housing and get good jobs.",2012-10-03,Republican
Lehrer,"All right. I think we have another clear difference between the two of you. Now, lets move to health care where I know there is a clear difference, and that has to do with the Affordable Care Act, Obamacare. And its a two-minute new  new segment, and that means two minutes each. And you go first, Governor Romney.",2012-10-03,Moderator
Lehrer,You want it repealed. You want the Affordable Care Act repealed. Why?,2012-10-03,Moderator
Romney,"I sure do. Well, in part, it comes, again, from my experience. You know, I was in New Hampshire. A woman came to me and she said, look, I cant afford insurance for myself or my son. I met a couple in Appleton, Wisconsin, and they said, were thinking of dropping our insurance, we cant afford it. And the number of small businesses Ive gone to that are saying theyre dropping insurance because they cant afford it, the cost of health care is just prohibitive. And  and weve got to deal with cost. And, unfortunately, when  when  when you look at Obamacare, the Congressional Budget Office has said it will cost $2,500 a year more than traditional insurance. So its adding to cost. And as a matter of fact, when the president ran for office, he said that, by this year, he would have brought down the cost of insurance for each family by $2,500 a family. Instead, its gone up by that amount. So its expensive. Expensive things hurt families. So thats one reason I dont want it. Second reason, it cuts $716 billion from Medicare to pay for it. I want to put that money back in Medicare for our seniors. Number three, it puts in place an unelected board thats going to tell people ultimately what kind of treatments they can have. I dont like that idea. Fourth, there was a survey done of small businesses across the country, said, whats been the effect of Obamacare on your hiring plans? And three-quarters of them said it makes us less likely to hire people. I just dont know how the president could have come into office, facing 23 million people out of work, rising unemployment, an economic crisis at the  at the kitchen table, and spend his energy and passion for two years fighting for Obamacare instead of fighting for jobs for the American people. It has killed jobs. And the best course for health care is to do what we did in my state: craft a plan at the state level that fits the needs of the state. And then lets focus on getting the costs down for people, rather than raising it with the $2,500 additional premium.",2012-10-03,Republican
Lehrer,"Mr. President, the argument against repeal? OBAMA: Well, four years ago, when I was running for office, I was traveling around and having those same conversations that Governor Romney talks about. And it wasnt just that small businesses were seeing costs skyrocket and they couldnt get affordable coverage even if they wanted to provide it to their employees. It wasnt just that this was the biggest driver of our federal deficit, our overall health care costs, but it was families who were worried about going bankrupt if they got sick, millions of families, all across the country. If they had a pre-existing condition, they might not be able to get coverage at all. If they did have coverage, insurance companies might impose an arbitrary limit. And so as a consequence, theyre paying their premiums, somebody gets really sick, lo and behold, they dont have enough money to pay the bills, because the insurance companies say that theyve hit the limit. So we did work on this, alongside working on jobs, because this is part of making sure that middle-class families are secure in this country. And let me tell you exactly what Obamacare did. Number one, if youve got health insurance, it doesnt mean a government takeover. You keep your own insurance. You keep your own doctor. But it does say insurance companies cant jerk you around. They cant impose arbitrary lifetime limits. They have to let you keep your kid on their insurance  your insurance plan until youre 26 years old. And it also says that youre going to have to get rebates if insurance companies are spending more on administrative costs and profits than they are on actual care. Number two, if you dont have health insurance, were essentially setting up a group plan that allows you to benefit from group rates that are typically 18 percent lower than if youre out there trying to get insurance on the individual market.",2012-10-03,Moderator
Lehrer,"Two minutes  two minutes is up, sir.",2012-10-03,Moderator
Obama,"No, I think  I had five seconds before you interrupted me, was the irony is that weve seen this model work really well in Massachusetts, because Governor Romney did a good thing, working with Democrats in the state to set up what is essentially the identical model and as a consequence people are covered there. It hasnt destroyed jobs. And as a consequence, we now have a system in which we have the opportunity to start bringing down costs, as opposed to just leaving millions of people out in the cold.",2012-10-03,Democrat
Lehrer,Your five seconds went away a long time ago.,2012-10-03,Moderator
Romney,"Well, I did with my first statement.",2012-10-03,Republican
Romney,"First of all, I like the way we did it in Massachusetts. I like the fact that in my state, we had Republicans and Democrats come together and work together. What you did instead was to push through a plan without a single Republican vote. As a matter of fact, when Massachusetts did something quite extraordinary  elected a Republican senator to stop Obamacare, you pushed it through anyway. So entirely on a partisan basis, instead of bringing America together and having a discussion on this important topic, you pushed through something that you and Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid thought was the best answer and drove it through. What we did in a legislature 87 percent Democrat, we worked together; 200 legislators in my legislature, only two voted against the plan by the time we were finished. What were some differences? We didnt raise taxes. Youve raised them by $1 trillion under Obamacare. We didnt cut Medicare. Of course, we dont have Medicare, but we didnt cut Medicare by $716 billion.",2012-10-03,Republican
Romney,"We didnt put in place a board that can tell people ultimately what treatments theyre going to receive. We didnt also do something that I think a number of people across this country recognize, which is put  put people in a position where theyre going to lose the insurance they had and they wanted. Right now, the CBO says up to 20 million people will lose their insurance as Obamacare goes into effect next year. And likewise, a study by McKinsey and Company of American businesses said 30 percent of them are anticipating dropping people from coverage. So for those reasons, for the tax, for Medicare, for this board, and for people losing their insurance, this is why the American people dont want Medicare  dont want Obamacare. Its why Republicans said, do not do this, and the Republicans had  had the plan. They put a plan out. They put out a plan, a bipartisan plan. It was swept aside. I think something this big, this important has to be done on a bipartisan basis. And we have to have a president who can reach across the aisle and fashion important legislation with the input from both parties.",2012-10-03,Republican
Obama,"Governor Romney said this has to be done on a bipartisan basis. This was a bipartisan idea. In fact, it was a Republican idea. And Governor Romney at the beginning of this debate wrote and said what we did in Massachusetts could be a model for the nation. And I agree that the Democratic legislators in Massachusetts might have given some advice to Republicans in Congress about how to cooperate, but the fact of the matter is, we used the same advisers, and they say its the same plan. Because there  there are two ways of dealing with our health care crisis. One is to simply leave a whole bunch of people uninsured and let them fend for themselves, to let businesses figure out how long they can continue to pay premiums until finally they just give up, and their workers are no longer getting insured, and thats been the trend line. Or, alternatively, we can figure out, how do we make the cost of care more effective? And there are ways of doing it. So at Cleveland Clinic, one of the best health care systems in the world, they actually provide great care cheaper than average. And the reason they do is because they do some smart things. They  they say, if a patients coming in, lets get all the doctors together at once, do one test instead of having the patient run around with 10 tests. Lets make sure that were providing preventive care so were catching the onset of something like diabetes. Lets  lets pay providers on the basis of performance as opposed to on the basis of how many procedures theyve  theyve engaged in. Now, so what this board does is basically identifies best practices and says, lets use the purchasing power of Medicare and Medicaid to help to institutionalize all these good things that we do. And the fact of the matter is that, when Obamacare is fully implemented, were going to be in a position to show that costs are going down. And over the last two years, health care premiums have gone up  its true  but theyve gone up slower than any time in the last 50 years. So were already beginning to see progress. In the meantime, folks out there with insurance, youre already getting a rebate. Let me make one last point. Governor Romney says, we should replace it, Im just going to repeal it, but  but we can replace it with something. But the problem is, he hasnt described what exactly wed replace it with, other than saying were going to leave it to the states.",2012-10-03,Democrat
Obama,"But the fact of the matter is that some of the prescriptions that hes offered, like letting you buy insurance across state lines, theres no indication that that somehow is going to help somebody whos got a pre-existing condition be able to finally buy insurance. In fact, its estimated that by repealing Obamacare, youre looking at 50 million people losing health insurance",2012-10-03,Democrat
Lehrer,Lets,2012-10-03,Moderator
Obama, at a time when its vitally important.,2012-10-03,Democrat
Lehrer,Lets let the governor explain what you would do,2012-10-03,Moderator
Romney,Well,2012-10-03,Republican
Lehrer, if Obamacare is repealed. How would you replace it?,2012-10-03,Moderator
Romney,"Well, actually its  its  its a lengthy description. But, number one, preexisting conditions are covered under my plan. Number two, young people are able to stay on their family plan. Thats already offered in the private marketplace. You dont have to have the government mandate that for that to occur. But lets come back to something the president and I agree on, which is the key task we have in health care is to get the cost down so its more affordable for families. And then he has as a model for doing that a board of people at the government, an unelected board, appointed board, who are going to decide what kind of treatment you ought to have.",2012-10-03,Republican
Romney,"In my opinion, the government is not effective in  in bringing down the cost of almost anything. As a matter of fact, free people and free enterprises trying to find ways to do things better are able to be more effective in bringing down the cost than the government will ever be. Your example of the Cleveland Clinic is my case in point, along with several others I could describe. This is the private market. These are small  these are enterprises competing with each other, learning how to do better and better jobs. I used to consult to businesses  excuse me, to hospitals and to health care providers. I was astonished at the creativity and innovation that exists in the American people. In order to bring the cost of health care down, we dont need to have a board of 15 people telling us what kinds of treatments we should have. We instead need to put insurance plans, providers, hospitals, doctors on target such that they have an incentive, as you say, performance pay, for doing an excellent job, for keeping costs down, and thats happening. Innermountain Healthcare does it superbly well, Mayo Clinic is doing it superbly well, Cleveland Clinic, others.",2012-10-03,Republican
Romney,"But the right answer is not to have the federal government take over health care and start mandating to the providers across America, telling a patient and a doctor what kind of treatment they can have. Thats the wrong way to go. The private market and individual responsibility always work best.",2012-10-03,Republican
Obama,"Let me just point out first of all this board that were talking about cant make decisions about what treatments are given. Thats explicitly prohibited in the law. But lets go back to what Governor Romney indicated, that under his plan, he would be able to cover people with preexisting conditions. Well, actually Governor, that isnt what your plan does. What your plan does is to duplicate whats already the law, which says if you are out of health insurance for three months, then you can end up getting continuous coverage and an insurance company cant deny you if youve  if its been under 90 days. But thats already the law and that doesnt help the millions of people out there with preexisting conditions. Theres a reason why Governor Romney set up the plan that he did in Massachusetts. It wasnt a government takeover of health care. It was the largest expansion of private insurance. But what it does say is that insurers, youve got to take everybody. Now, that also means that youve got more customers. But when  when Governor Romney says that hell replace it with something, but cant detail how it will be in fact replaced and the reason he set up the system he did in Massachusetts was because there isnt a better way of dealing with the preexisting conditions problem.",2012-10-03,Democrat
Obama,"It just reminds me of, you know, he says that hes going to close deductions and loopholes for his tax plan. Thats how its going to be paid for, but we dont know the details. He says that hes going to replace Dodd-Frank, Wall Street reform, but we dont know exactly which ones. He wont tell us. He now says hes going to replace Obamacare and ensure that all the good things that are in it are going to be in there and you dont have to worry. No. The reason is, is because, when we reform Wall Street, when we tackle the problem of pre-existing conditions, then, you know, these are tough problems and weve got to make choices. And the choices weve made have been ones that ultimately are benefiting middle-class families all across the country.",2012-10-03,Democrat

Romney,No. I  I have to respond to that.,2012-10-03,Republican
Lehrer,"No, but",2012-10-03,Moderator
Romney,"Which is  which is my experience as a governor is if I come in and  and lay down a piece of legislation and say, Its my way or the highway, I dont get a lot done. What I do is the same way that Tip ONeill and Ronald Reagan worked together some years ago. When Ronald Reagan ran for office, he laid out the principles that he was going to foster. He said he was going to lower tax rates. He said he was going to broaden the base. Youve said the same thing, youre going to simplify the tax code, broaden the base. Those are my principles. I want to bring down the tax burden on middle-income families. And Im going to work together with Congress to say, OK, what  what are the various ways we could bring down deductions, for instance? One way, for instance, would be to have a single number. Make up a number, $25,000, $50,000. Anybody can have deductions up to that amount. And then that number disappears for high-income people. Thats one way one could do it. One could follow Bowles-Simpson as a model and take deduction by deduction and make differences that way. There are alternatives to accomplish the objective I have, which is to bring down rates, broaden the base, simplify the code, and create incentives for growth. And with regards to health care, you had remarkable details with regards to my pre-existing condition plan. You obviously studied up on  on my plan. In fact, I do have a plan that deals with people with pre-existing conditions. Thats part of my health care plan. And what we did in Massachusetts is a model for the nation state by state. And I said that at that time. The federal government taking over health care for the entire nation and whisking aside the 10th Amendment, which gives states the rights for these kinds of things, is not the course for America to have a stronger, more vibrant economy.",2012-10-03,Republican

Obama,"The first role of the federal government is to keep the American people safe. Thats its most basic function. And as commander-in-chief, that is something that Ive worked on and thought about every single day that Ive been in the Oval Office. But I also believe that government has the capacity, the federal government has the capacity to help open up opportunity and create ladders of opportunity and to create frameworks where the American people can succeed. Look, the genius of America is the free enterprise system and freedom and the fact that people can go out there and start a business, work on an idea, make their own decisions.",2012-10-03,Democrat
Obama,"But as Abraham Lincoln understood, there are also some things we do better together. So, in the middle of the Civil War, Abraham Lincoln said, lets help to finance the Transcontinental Railroad, lets start the National Academy of Sciences, lets start land grant colleges, because we want to give these gateways of opportunity for all Americans, because if all Americans are getting opportunity, were all going to be better off. That doesnt restrict peoples freedom. That enhances it. And so what Ive tried to do as president is to apply those same principles. And when it comes to education what Ive said is weve got to reform schools that are not working. We use something called Race to the Top. Wasnt a top-down approach, Governor. What weve said is to states, well give you more money if you initiate reforms. And as a consequence, you had 46 states around the country who have made a real difference. But what Ive also said is lets hire another 100,000 math and science teachers to make sure we maintain our technological lead and our people are skilled and able to succeed. And hard-pressed states right now cant all do that. In fact weve seen layoffs of hundreds of thousands of teachers over the last several years, and Governor Romney doesnt think we need more teachers. I do, because I think that that is the kind of investment where the federal government can help. It cant do it all, but it can make a difference. And as a consequence well have a better trained workforce and that will create jobs because companies want to locate in places where weve got a skilled workforce.",2012-10-03,Democrat

Romney,"Well, first, I love great schools. Massachusetts, our schools are ranked number one of all 50 states. And the key to great schools, great teachers. So I reject the idea that I dont believe in great teachers or more teachers. Every school district, every state should make that decision on their own. The role of government: Look behind us. The Constitution and the Declaration of Independence. The role of government is to promote and protect the principles of those documents.",2012-10-03,Republican
Romney,"First, life and liberty. We have a responsibility to protect the lives and liberties of our people, and that means a military second to none. I do not believe in cutting our military. I believe in maintaining the strength of Americas military. Second, in that line that says we are endowed by our creator with our rights, I believe we must maintain our commitment to religious tolerance and freedom in this country. That statement also says that we are endowed by our creator with the right to pursue happiness as we choose. I interpret that as, one, making sure that those people who are less fortunate and cant care for themselves are cared by  by one another. Were a nation that believes that were all children of the same god and we care for those that have difficulties, those that are elderly and have problems and challenges, those that are disabled. We care for them. And we  we look for discovery and innovation, all these things desired out of the American heart to provide the pursuit of happiness for our citizens. But we also believe in maintaining for individuals the right to pursue their dreams and not to have the government substitute itself for the rights of free individuals. And what were seeing right now is, in my view, a  a trickle-down government approach, which has government thinking it can do a better job than free people pursuing their dreams. And its not working. And the proof of that is 23 million people out of work. The proof of that is 1 out of 6 people in poverty. The proof of that is weve gone from 32 million on food stamps to 47 million on food stamps. The proof of that is that 50 percent of college graduates this year cant find work.",2012-10-03,Republican

Lehrer,All right. Lets go through some specifics in terms of what  how each of you views the role of government. How do  education. Does the federal government have a responsibility to improve the quality of public education in America?,2012-10-03,Moderator
Romney,"Well, the primary responsibility for education is  is, of course, at the state and local level. But the federal government also can play a very important role. And I  and I agree with Secretary Arne Duncan, hes  some ideas hes put forward on Race to the Top, not all of them, but some of them I agree with and  and congratulate him for pursuing that. The federal government can get local and  and state schools to do a better job. My own view, by the way, is Ive added to that. I happen to believe, I want the kids that are getting federal dollars from IDEA or Title I  these are disabled kids or  or  or poor kids or  or lower-income kids, rather, I want them to be able to go to the school of their choice. So all federal funds, instead of going to the  to the state or to the school district, Id have go, if you will, follow the child and let the parent and the child decide where to send their  their  their student.",2012-10-03,Republican
Lehrer,"How do you see the federal governments responsibility to, as I say, to improve the quality of public education in this country?",2012-10-03,Moderator
Obama,"Well, as Ive indicated, I think that it has a significant role to play. Through our Race to the Top program, weve worked with Republican and Democratic governors to initiate major reforms, and theyre having an impact right now.",2012-10-03,Democrat
Lehrer,Do you think you have a difference with your views and  and those of Governor Romney on  about education and the federal government?,2012-10-03,Moderator
Obama,"You know, this is where budgets matter, because budgets reflect choices. So when Governor Romney indicates that he wants to cut taxes and potentially benefit folks like me and him, and to pay for it were having to initiate significant cuts in federal support for education, that makes a difference. You know, his  his running mate, Congressman Ryan, put forward a budget that reflects many of the principles that Governor Romneys talked about. And it wasnt very detailed. This seems to be a trend. But  but what it did do is to  if you extrapolated how much money were talking about, youd look at cutting the education budget by up to 20 percent.",2012-10-03,Democrat
Obama,"When it comes to community colleges, we are seeing great work done out there all over the country because we have the opportunity to train people for jobs that exist right now. And one of the things I suspect Governor Romney and I probably agree on is getting businesses to work with community colleges so that theyre setting up their training programs",2012-10-03,Democrat
Lehrer,"Do you  do you agree, Governor?",2012-10-03,Moderator
Obama,Let me just finish the point.,2012-10-03,Democrat
Obama,"The  where theyre partnering so that theyre designing training programs. And people who are going through them know that theres a job waiting for them if they complete it. That makes a big difference, but that requires some federal support. Let me just say one final example. When it comes to making college affordable, whether its two-year or four-year, one of the things that I did as president was we were sending $60 billion to banks and lenders as middlemen for the student loan program, even though the loans were guaranteed. So there was no risk for the banks or the lenders, but they were taking billions out of the system. And we said, Why not cut out the middleman? And as a consequence, what weve been able to do is to provide millions more students assistance, lower or keep low interest rates on student loans. And this is an example of where our priorities make a difference. Governor Romney, I genuinely believe cares about education, but when he tells a student that, you know, you should borrow money from your parents to go to college, you know, that indicates the degree to which, you know, there may not be as much of a focus on the fact that folks like myself, folks like Michelle, kids probably who attend University of Denver, just dont have that option. And for us to be able to make sure that theyve got that opportunity and they can walk through that door, that is vitally important not just to those kids. Its how were going to grow this economy over the long term.",2012-10-03,Democrat
Lehrer,"Were running out of time, gentlemen.",2012-10-03,Moderator
Romney,"Mr. President, Mr. President, youre entitled as the president to your own airplane and to your own house, but not to your own facts. All right, Im not going to cut education funding. I dont have any plan to cut education funding and  and grants that go to people going to college. Im planning on (inaudible) to grow. So Im not planning on making changes there. But you make a very good point, which is that the place you put your money just makes a pretty clear indication of where your heart is. You put $90 billion into  into green jobs. And I  look, Im all in favor of green energy. $90 billion, that would have  that would have hired 2 million teachers. $90 billion. And these businesses, many of them have gone out of business, I think about half of them, of the ones have been invested in have gone out of business. A number of them happened to be owned by people who were contributors to your campaigns. Look, the right course for Americas government, we were talking about the role of government, is not to become the economic player, picking winners and losers, telling people what kind of health treatment they can receive, taking over the health care system that has existed in this country for a long, long time and has produced the best health records in the world. The right answer for government is say, How do we make the private sector become more efficient and more effective? How do we get schools to be more competitive? Lets grade them. I propose we grade our schools so parents know which schools are succeeding and failing, so they can take their child to a  to a school that hes being more successful. I dont want to cut our commitment to education. I wanted to make it more effective and efficient. And by the way, Ive had that experience. I dont just talk about it. Ive been there. Massachusetts schools are ranked number one in the nation. This is not because I didnt have commitment to education. Its because I care about education for all of our kids.",2012-10-03,Republican
Lehrer,"All right, gentlemen",2012-10-03,Moderator
Lehrer,"Excuse me (inaudible). Excuse me, sir. Weve got  weve got  barely have three minutes left. Im not going to grade the two of you and say your answers have been too long or Ive done a poor job.",2012-10-03,Moderator
Obama,Youve done a great job.,2012-10-03,Democrat
Lehrer,"Oh, well, no. But the fact is government  the role of government and governing, weve lost a pod in other words. So we only have three  three minutes left in the  in the debate before we go to your closing statements. And so I want to ask finally here, and remember, weve got three minutes total time here  and the question is this. Many of the legislative functions of the federal government right now are in a state of paralysis as a result of partisan gridlock. If elected, in your case, if re-elected, in your case, what would you do about that?",2012-10-03,Moderator
Romney,"Jim, I had the great experience  it didnt seem like it at the time  of being elected in a state where my legislature was 87 percent Democrat. And that meant I figured out from day one I had to get along and I had to work across the aisle to get anything done. We drove our schools to be number one in the nation. We cut taxes 19 times.",2012-10-03,Republican
Lehrer,But what would you do as president?,2012-10-03,Moderator
Romney,"We  as president, I will sit on day one  actually, the day after I get elected  Ill sit down with leaders  the Democratic leaders, as well as Republican leaders, and continue  as we did in my state  we met every Monday for a couple hours, talked about the issues and the challenges in the  in the  in our state in that case. We have to work on a collaborative basis, not because were going to compromise our principle, but because theres common ground. And the challenges America faces right now  look, the reason Im in this race is there are people that are really hurting today in this country. And we face  this deficit could crush the future generations. Whats happening in the Middle East, there are developments around the world that are of real concern.",2012-10-03,Republican
Lehrer,All right.,2012-10-03,Moderator
Romney,And Republicans and Democrats both love America. But we need to have leadership  leadership in Washington that will actually bring people together and get the job done and could not care less if  if its a Republican or a Democrat. Ive done it before. Ill do it again.,2012-10-03,Republican
Lehrer,Mr. President?,2012-10-03,Moderator
Obama,"Well, first of all, I think Governor Romneys going to have a busy first day, because hes also going to repeal Obamacare, which will not be very popular among Democrats as youre sitting down with them. But, look, my philosophy has been, I will take ideas from anybody, Democrat or Republican, as long as theyre advancing the cause of making middle-class families stronger and giving ladders of opportunity to the middle class. Thats how we cut taxes for middle- class families and small businesses. Thats how we cut a trillion dollars of spending that wasnt advancing that cause. Thats how we signed three trade deals into law that are helping us to double our exports and sell more American products around the world. Thats how we repealed dont ask/dont tell. Thats how we ended the war in Iraq, as I promised, and thats how were going to wind down the war in Afghanistan. Thats how we went after Al Qaida and bin Laden. So weve  weve seen progress even under Republican control of the House of Representatives. But, ultimately, part of being principled, part of being a leader is, A, being able to describe exactly what it is that you intend to do, not just saying, Ill sit down, but you have to have a plan. Number two, whats important is occasionally youve got to say no, to  to  to folks both in your own party and in the other party. And, you know, yes, have we had some fights between me and the Republicans when  when they fought back against us reining in the excesses of Wall Street? Absolutely, because that was a fight that needed to be had. When  when we were fighting about whether or not we were going to make sure that Americans had more security with their health insurance and they said no, yes, that was a fight that we needed to have.",2012-10-03,Democrat
Lehrer,All right,2012-10-03,Moderator
Obama,"And so part of leadership and governing is both saying what it is that you are for, but also being willing to say no to some things. And Ive got to tell you, Governor Romney, when it comes to his own party during the course of this campaign, has not displayed that willingness to say no to some of the more extreme parts of his party.",2012-10-03,Democrat
Lehrer,"That brings us to closing statements. It was a coin toss. Governor Romney, you won the toss and you elected to go last, so you have a closing two minutes, Mr. President.",2012-10-03,Moderator
Obama,"Well, Jim, I want to thank you, and I want to thank Governor Romney, because I think was a terrific debate, and I very much appreciate it. And I want to thank the University of Denver. You know, four years ago, we were going through a major crisis. And yet my faith and confidence in the American future is undiminished. And the reason is because of its people, because of the woman I met in North Carolina who decided at 55 to go back to school because she wanted to inspire her daughter and now has a job from that new training that shes gotten; because a company in Minnesota who was willing to give up salaries and perks for their executives to make sure that they didnt lay off workers during a recession. The auto workers that you meet in Toledo or Detroit take such pride in building the best cars in the world, not just because of a paycheck, but because it gives them that sense of pride, that theyre helping to build America. And so the question now is how do we build on those strengths. And everything that Ive tried to do, and everything that Im now proposing for the next four years in terms of improving our education system or developing American energy or making sure that were closing loopholes for companies that are shipping jobs overseas and focusing on small businesses and companies that are creating jobs here in the United States, or closing our deficit in a responsible, balanced way that allows us to invest in our future. All those things are designed to make sure that the American people, their genius, their grit, their determination, is  is channeled and  and they have an opportunity to succeed. And everybodys getting a fair shot. And everybodys getting a fair share  everybodys doing a fair share, and everybodys playing by the same rules. You know, four years ago, I said that Im not a perfect man and I wouldnt be a perfect president. And thats probably a promise that Governor Romney thinks Ive kept. But I also promised that Id fight every single day on behalf of the American people, the middle class, and all those who were striving to get into the middle class. Ive kept that promise and if youll vote for me, then I promise Ill fight just as hard in a second term.",2012-10-03,Democrat
Lehrer,"Governor Romney, your two-minute closing.",2012-10-03,Moderator
Romney,"Thank you, Jim, and Mr. President. And thank you for tuning in this evening. This is a  this is an important election and Im concerned about America. Im concerned about the direction America has been taking over the last four years. I  I know this is bigger than an election about the two of us as individuals. Its bigger than our respective parties. Its an election about the course of America. What kind of America do you want to have for yourself and for your children. And there really are two very different paths that we began speaking about this evening, and over the course of this month were going to have two more presidential debates and a vice presidential debate. Were talk about those two paths. But they lead in very different directions. And its not just looking to our words that you have to take in evidence of where they go. You can look at the record. Theres no question in my mind that if the president were to be reelected youll continue to see a middle-class squeeze with incomes going down and prices going up. Ill get incomes up again. Youll see chronic unemployment. Weve had 43 straight months with unemployment above 8 percent. If Im president I will create  help create 12 million new jobs in this country with rising incomes. If the presidents reelected, Obamacare will be fully installed. In my view thats going to mean a whole different way of life for people who counted on the insurance plan they had in the past. Many will lose it. Youre going to see health premiums go up by some $2,500 per family. If Im elected we wont have Obama. Well put in place the kind of principles that I put in place in my own state and allow each state to craft their own programs to get people insured and well focus on getting the cost of health care down. If the president were to be reelected youre going to see a $716 billion cut to Medicare. Youll have 4 million people who will lose Medicare Advantage. Youll have hospital and providers thatll no longer accept Medicare patients. Ill restore that $716 billion to Medicare. And finally, military. The presidents reelected youll see dramatic cuts to our military. The secretary of defense has said these would be even devastating. I will not cut our commitment to our military. I will keep America strong and get Americas middle class working again. Thank you, Jim.",2012-10-03,Republican

Moderator,"Good evening from the Clark Athletic Center at the University of Massachusetts in Boston. Im Jim Lehrer of the NewsHour on PBS, and I welcome you to the first of three 90-minute debates between the Democratic candidate for president, Vice President Al Gore and the Republican candidate, Governor George W. Bush of Texas. The debates are sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates and they will be conducted within formats and rules agreed to between the commission and the two campaigns. Well have the candidates at podiums. No answer to a question can exceed two minutes. Rebuttal is limited to one minute. But as moderator I have the option to follow up and to extend any particular give and take another three-and-a-half minutes. Even then, no single answer can exceed two minutes. The candidates under their rules may not question each other directly. There will be no opening statements, but each candidate may have up to two minutes for a closing statement. The questions and the subjects were chosen by me alone. I have told no one from the two campaigns, or the Commission, or anyone else involved what they are. There is a small audience in the hall tonight. They are not here to participate, only to listen. I have asked, and they have agreed, to remain silent for the next 90 minutes. Except for right now, when they will applaud as we welcome the two candidates, Governor Bush and Vice President Gore.",2000-10-03,Moderator
Moderator,"And now the first question as determined by a flip of a coin, it goes to Vice President Gore. Vice President Gore, you have questioned whether Governor Bush has the experience to be President of the United States. What exactly do you mean?",2000-10-03,Moderator
Gore,"Well, Jim, first of all, I would like to thank the sponsors of this debate and the people of Boston for hosting the debate. I would like to thank Governor Bush for participating, and I would like to say Im happy to be here with Tipper and our family. I have actually not questioned Governor Bushs experience. I have questioned his proposals. And here is why. I think this is a very important moment for our country. We have achieved extraordinary prosperity. And in this election, America has to make an important choice. Will we use our prosperity to enrich not just the few, but all of our families? I believe we have to make the right and responsible choices. If Im entrusted with the presidency, here are the choices that I will make. I will balance the budget every year. I will pay down the national debt. I will put Medicare and Social Security in a lockbox and protect them. And I will cut taxes for middle-class families. I believe its important to resist the temptation to squander our surplus. If we make the right choices, we can have a prosperity that endures and enriches all of our people. If Im entrusted with the presidency, I will help parents and strengthen families because, you know, if we have prosperity that grows and grows, we still wont be successful unless we strengthen families by, for example, ensuring that children can always go to schools that are safe. By giving parents the tools to protect their children against cultural pollution. I will make sure that we invest in our country and our families. And I mean investing in education, health care, the environment, and middle-class tax cuts and retirement security. That is my agenda and that is why I think that its not just a question of experience.",2000-10-03,Democrat
Moderator,"Governor Bush, one minute rebuttal.",2000-10-03,Moderator
Bush,"Well, we do come from different places. I come from West Texas. The governor is the chief executive officer. We know how to set agendas. I think youll find the difference reflected in our budgets. I want to take one-half of the surplus and dedicate it to Social Security. One-quarter of the surplus for important projects, and I want to send one-quarter of the surplus back to the people who pay the bills. I want everybody who pays taxes to have their tax rates cut. And that stands in contrast to my worthy opponents plan, which will increase the size of government dramatically. His plan is three times larger than President Clintons proposed plan eight years ago. It is a plan that will have 200 new programs  expanded programs and creates 20,000 new bureaucrats. It it empowers Washington. Tonight youre going to hear that my passion and my vision is to empower Americans to be able to make decisions for themselves in their own lives.",2000-10-03,Republican
Moderator,"So I take it by your answer, then, Mr. Vice President, that in an interview recently with the New York Times when you said that you questioned whether or not Governor Bush has experience enough to be president, you were talking about strictly policy differences.",2000-10-03,Moderator
Gore,"Yes, Jim. I said that his tax cut plan, for example, raises the question of whether its the right choice for the country. And let me give you an example of what I mean. Under Governor Bushs tax cut proposal, he would spend more money on tax cuts for the wealthiest 1% than all of the new spending that he proposes for education, health care, prescription drugs and national defense all combined. Now, I think those are the wrong priorities. Now, under my proposal, for every dollar that I propose in spending for things like education and health care, I will put another dollar into middle class tax cuts. And for every dollar that I spend in those two categories, Ill put $2 toward paying down the national debt. I think its very important to keep the debt going down and completely eliminate it. And I also think its very important to go to the next stage of welfare reform. Our country has cut the welfare rolls in half. I fought hard from my days in the Senate and as vice president to cut the welfare rolls and weve moved millions of people in America into good jobs. But its now time for the next stage of welfare reform, and include fathers and not only mothers.",2000-10-03,Democrat
Moderator,Were going to get a lot of those.,2000-10-03,Moderator
Bush,Let me just say that obviously tonight were going to hear some phony numbers about what I think and what we ought to do. People need to know that over the next ten years it is going to be $25 trillion of revenue that comes into our treasurey and we anticipate spending $21 trillion. And my plan say why dont we pass 1.3 trillion of that back to the people who pay the bills? Surely we can afford 5% of the $25 trillion that are coming into the treasury to the hard working people that pay the bills. There is a difference of opinion. My opponent thinks the government  the surplus is the governments money. Thats not what I think. I think its the hard-working people of Americas money and I want to share some of that money with you so you have more money to build and save and dream for your families. Its a difference of opinion. Its a difference between government making decisions for you and you getting more of your money to make decisions for yourself.,2000-10-03,Republican
Moderator,"Let me just follow up one quick question. When you hear Vice President Gore question your experience, do you read it the same way, that hes talking about policy differences only?",2000-10-03,Moderator
Bush,"Yes. I take him for his word. Look, I fully recognize Im not of Washington. Im from Texas. And hes got a lot of experience, but so do I. And Ive been the chief executive officer of the second biggest state in the union. I have a proud record of working with both Republicans and Democrats, which is what our nation needs. Somebody that can come to Washington and say lets forget all the finger pointing and get positive things done on Medicare, prescription drugs, Social Security, and so I take him for his word.",2000-10-03,Republican
Gore,"Jim, if I could just respond. I know that. The governor used the phrase phony numbers, but if you look at the plan and add the numbers up, these numbers are correct. He spends more money for tax cuts for the wealthiest 1% than all of his new spending proposals for health care, prescription drugs, education and national defense all combined. I agree that the surplus is the American peoples money, its your money. Thats why I dont think we should give nearly half of it to the wealthiest 1%, because the other 99% have had an awful lot to do with building the surplus in our prosperity.",2000-10-03,Democrat
Moderator,Three-and-a-half minutes is up. New question.,2000-10-03,Moderator
Bush,I hope its about wealthy people.,2000-10-03,Republican
Moderator,"Governor Bush, you have a question. This is a companion question to the question I asked Vice President Gore. You have questioned whether Vice President Gore has demonstrated the leadership qualities necessary to be President of the United States. What do you mean by that?",2000-10-03,Moderator
Bush,"Actually what Ive said, Jim. Ive said that eight years ago they campaigned on prescription drugs for seniors. And four years ago they campaigned on getting prescription drugs for seniors. And now theyre campaigning on getting prescription drugs for seniors. It seems like they cant get it done. Now, they may blame other folks, but its time to get somebody in Washington who is going to work with both Republicans and Democrats to get some positive things done when it comes to our seniors. And so what Ive said is that theres been some missed opportunities. Theyve had a chance. Theyve had a chance to form consensus. Ive got a plan on Medicare, for example, thats a two-stage plan that says well have immediate help for seniors and what I call immediate Helping Hand, a $48 billion program. But I also want to say to seniors, if youre happy with Medicare the way it is, fine, you can stay in the program. But were going to give you additional choices like they give federal employees in the federal employee health plan. They have a variety of choices to choose, so should seniors. And my point has been, as opposed to politicizing an issue like Medicare, in other words, holding it up as an issue, hoping somebody bites it and try to clobber them over the head with it for political purposes, this year, in the year 2000, its time to get it done once and for all. Thats what Ive been critical about the administration for. Same with Social Security. I think there was a good opportunity to bring Republicans and Democrats together to reform the Social Security system so seniors will never go without. Those on Social Security today will have their promise made, but also to give younger workers the option at their choice of being able to manage some of their own money in the private sector to make sure theres a Social Security system around tomorrow. There are a lot of young workers at our rallies we go to that when they hear Ill trust them at their option to be able to manage, under certain guidelines, some of their own money to get a better rate of return so that theyll have a retirement plan in the future, they begin to nod their heads and they want a different attitude in Washington.",2000-10-03,Republican
Moderator,One minute rebuttal.,2000-10-03,Moderator
Gore,"Well, Jim, under my plan all seniors will get prescription drugs under Medicare. The governor has described Medicare as a government HMO. Its not, and let me explain the difference. Under the Medicare prescription drug proposal Im making, here is how it works, you go to your own doctor. Your doctor chooses your prescription. No HMO or insurance company can take those choices away from you. Then you go to your own pharmacy. You fill the prescription and Medicare pays half the cost. If youre in a very poor family or if you have very high costs, Medicare will pay all the costs, a $25 premium, and much better benefits than you can possibly find in the private sector. Now here is the contrast. 95% of all seniors would get no help whatsoever under my opponents plan for the first four or five years. Now, one thing I dont understand, Jim, is why is it that the wealthiest 1% get their tax cuts the first year, but 95% of seniors have to wait four to five years before they get a single penny?",2000-10-03,Democrat
Bush,"I guess my answer to that is the man is running on Medi-scare. Trying to frighten people in the voting booth. Its just not the way I think and its not my intentions and not my plan. I want all seniors to have prescription drugs in Medicare. We need to reform Medicare. Theres been opportunity to do so but this administration has failed to do it. And so seniors will have not only a Medicare plan where the poor seniors will have prescription drugs paid for, but there will be a variety of options. The current system today has meant a lot for a lot of seniors, and I really appreciate the intentions of the current system as I mentioned. If youre happy with the system you can stay in it. But there are a lot of procedures that havent kept up in Medicare with the current times. No prescription drug benefits, no drug therapy, no preventative medicines, no vision care. We need to have a modern system to help seniors, and the idea of supporting a federally controlled 132,000-page document bureaucracy as being a compassionate way for seniors, and the only compassionate source of care for seniors is not my vision. I believe we ought to give seniors more options. I believe we ought to make the system work better. I know this. I know it will require a different kind of leader to go to Washington to say to both Republicans and Democrats, lets come together. Youve had your chance, Vice President, youve been there for eight years and nothing has been done. My point is, is that my plan not only trusts seniors with options, my plan sets aside $3.4 trillion for Medicare over the next ten years. My plan also says it requires a new approach in Washington, D.C. Its going to require somebody who can work across the partisan divide.",2000-10-03,Republican
Gore,"If I could respond to that. Under my plan I will put Medicare in an iron clad lockbox and prevent the money from being used for anything other than Medicare. The governor has declined to endorse that idea even though the Republican as well as Democratic leaders in Congress have endorsed it. I would be interested to see if he would say this evening hell put Medicare in a lockbox. I dont think he will because under his plan if you work out the numbers  $100 billion comes out of Medicare just for the wealthiest 1% in the tax cut. Now here is the difference. Some people who say the word reform actually mean cuts. Under the governors plan, if you kept the same fee for service that you have now under Medicare, your premiums would go up by between 18% and 47%, and that is the study of the Congressional plan that hes modeled his proposal on by the Medicare actuaries. Let me give you one quick example. There is a man here tonight named George McKinney from Milwaukee. Hes 70 years old, has high blood pressure, his wife has heart trouble. They have an income of $25,000 a year. They cant pay for their prescription drugs and so theyre some of the ones that go to Canada regularly in order to get their prescription drugs. Under my plan, half of their costs would be paid right away. Under Governor Bushs plan, they would get not one penny for four to five years and then they would be forced to go into an HMO or to an insurance company and ask them for coverage, but there would be no limit on the premiums or the deductibles or any of the terms and conditions.",2000-10-03,Democrat
Bush,"I cannot let this go by, the old-style Washington politics, of were going to scare you in the voting booth. Under my plan the man gets immediate help with prescription drugs. Its called Immediate Helping Hand. Instead of squabbling and finger pointing, he gets immediate help. Let me say something.",2000-10-03,Republican
Moderator,Your [cross talk],2000-10-03,Moderator
Gore,"Can I make another point? They get $25,000 a year income, that makes them ineligible.",2000-10-03,Democrat
Bush,"Look, this is a man who has great numbers. He talks about numbers. Im beginning to think not only did he invent the Internet, but he invented the calculator. Its fuzzy math. Its a scaring  hes trying to scare people in the voting booth. Under my tax plan that he continues to criticize, I set one-third. The federal government should take no more than a third of anybodys check. But I also dropped the bottom rate from 15% to 10%. Because by far the vast majority of the help goes to people at the bottom end of the economic ladder. If youre a family of four in Massachusetts, making $50,000, you get a 50% cut in the federal income taxes you pay. Its from $4000 to about $2000. Now, the difference in our plans is I want that $2,000 to go to you, and the vice president would like to be spending the $2,000 on your behalf.",2000-10-03,Republican

Gore,"Its just clear you can go to the website and look. If you make more than $25,000 a year you dont get a penny of help under the Bush prescription drug proposal for at least four to five years, and then youre pushed into a Medicare  into an HMO or insurance company plan, and theres no limit on the premiums or the deductibles or any of the conditions. And the insurance companies say it wont work and they wont offer these plans.",2000-10-03,Democrat
Moderator,"Let me ask you both this and well move on on the subject. As a practical matter, both of you want to bring prescription drugs to seniors, correct?",2000-10-03,Moderator
Gore,Correct.,2000-10-03,Democrat
Bush,Correct.,2000-10-03,Republican
Gore,The difference is I want to bring it to 100% and he wants to bring it to 5%.,2000-10-03,Democrat
Bush,"Thats totally false for him to stand up here and say that. Let me make sure the seniors hear me loud and clear. They have had their chance to get something done. Im going to work with Democrats and Republicans to reform the system. All seniors will be covered, all poor seniors will have their prescription drugs paid for, and in the meantime, well have a plan to help poor seniors and in the meantime it could be one year or two years.",2000-10-03,Republican
Gore,Let me call your attention to the key word there. He said all poor seniors.,2000-10-03,Democrat
Bush,Wait a minute. All seniors are covered under prescription drugs in my plan.,2000-10-03,Republican
Gore,In the first year?,2000-10-03,Democrat
Bush,"If we can get it done in the first year, you bet. Yours is phased in in eight years.",2000-10-03,Republican
Gore,Its a two-phase plan. For the first four years  it takes a year to pass it and for the first four years only the poor are covered. Middle class seniors like George McKinney and his wife are not covered for four to five years.,2000-10-03,Democrat
Moderator,"I have an idea. If you have any more to say about this, you can say it in your closing statements and well move on, okay? New question. Vice President Gore. How would you contrast your approach to preventing future oil price and supply problems like we have now to the approach of Governor Bush?",2000-10-03,Moderator
Gore,"Excellent question. And here is the simple difference. My plan has not only a short-term component, but also a long-term component. And it focuses not only on increasing the supply, which I think we have to do, but also on working on the consumption side. Now, in the short-term we have to free ourselves from the domination of the big oil companies that have the ability to manipulate the price from OPEC when they want to raise the price. And in the long-term we have to give new incentives for the development of domestic resources like deep gas in the western Gulf, like stripper wells for oil, but also renewable sources of energy. And domestic sources that are cleaner and better. And Im proposing a plan that will give tax credits and tax incentives for the rapid development of new kinds of cars and trucks and buses and factories and boilers and furnaces that dont have as much pollution, that dont burn as much energy, and that help us get out on the cutting edge of the new technologies that will create millions of new jobs. Because, when we sell these new products here, well then be able to sell them overseas. There is a ravenous demand for them overseas. Now, another big difference is Governor Bush is proposing to open up some of our most precious environmental treasures, like the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge for the big oil companies to go in and start producing oil there. I think that is the wrong choice. It would only give us a few months worth of oil and the oil wouldnt start flowing for many years into the future. I dont think its a fair price to pay to destroy precious parts of Americas environment. We have to bet on the future and move beyond the current technologies to have a whole new generation of more efficient, cleaner, energy technology.",2000-10-03,Democrat
Bush,"Its an issue I know a lot about. I was a small oil person for a while in west Texas. This is an administration thats had no plan. And all of a sudden the results of having no plan have caught up with America. First and foremost we have to fully fund LIHEAP which is a way to help low income folks, particularly here in the east to pay for high fuel bills. Secondly, we need an active exploration program in America. The only way to become less dependent on foreign sources of crude oil is to explore at home. You bet I want to open up a small part of Alaska. When that field is online it will produce one million barrels a day. Today we import one million barrels from Saddam Hussein. I would rather that a million come from our own hemisphere, our own country as opposed to Saddam Hussein. I want to build more pipelines to move natural gas throughout this hemisphere. I want to develop the coal resources in America. Have clean coal technologies. Weve got abundant supplies of energy here in America and wed better get after it, we better start exploring it or otherwise well be in deep trouble in the future because of our dependency upon foreign sources of crude.",2000-10-03,Republican
Moderator,"So if somebody is watching tonight and listening to what the two of you just said, is it fair to say, okay, the differences between Governor Bush and Vice President Gore are as follows. Youre for doing something on the consumption end and youre for doing something on the production end?",2000-10-03,Moderator
Gore,"Let me clarify. Im for doing something both on the supply side and production side and on the consumption side. Let me say, that I found one thing in Governor Bushs answer that we certainly agree on, and thats the low income heating assistance program. I commend you for supporting that. I worked to get $400 million just a couple of weeks ago. And to establish a permanent home heating oil reserve here in the northeast. Now, as for the proposals that Ive worked for for renewables and conservation and efficiencies and new technologies. The fact is for the last few years in the Congress, weve faced a lot of opposition to them. Theyve only approved about 10% of the agenda Ive helped to send up there. I think we need to get serious about this energy crisis, both in the Congress and in the White House, and if you entrust me with the presidency, I will tackle this problem and focus on new technologies that will make us less dependent on big oil or foreign oil.",2000-10-03,Democrat
Moderator,How would you draw the difference?,2000-10-03,Moderator
Bush,"Well I would first say he should have been tackling it for the last seven years. Secondly the difference is we need to explore at home. And the vice president doesnt believe in exploration in Alaska. Theres a lot of shut-in gas that we need to be moving out of Alaska by pipeline. Theres an interesting issue up in the northwest as well. Do we remove dams that produce hydroelectric energy? Im against removing dams in the northwest. I dont know where the vice president stands but thats a renewable energy source of energy. We need to keep that in line. I was in coal country in West Virginia yesterday. There is an abundant supply of coal in America. I know we can do a better job of clean coal technologies. Im going to ask the Congress for $2 billion to make sure we have the cleanest coal technologies in the world. My answer to you is in the short-term we need to get after it here in America. We need to explore our resources and we need to develop our reservoirs of domestic production. We also need to have a hemispheric energy policy where Canada, Mexico and the United States come together. I brought this up recently with Vincent Fox the newly elected president in Mexico, hes a man I know from Mexico. I talked to him about how best to expedite the exploration of natural gas in Mexico and transport it up to the United States so we become less dependent on foreign sources of crude oil. This is a major problem facing America. The administration did not deal with it. Its time for a new administration to deal with the energy problem.",2000-10-03,Republican
Gore,"If I may just briefly, Jim, note. I found a couple of other things we agree upon. We may not find that many this evening, so I wanted to emphasize. I strongly support new investments in clean coal technology. I made a proposal three months ago on this. And also domestic exploration yes, but not in the environmental treasures of our country. We dont have to do that. Thats the wrong choice. I know the oil companies have been itching to do that, but it is not the right thing for the future.",2000-10-03,Democrat
Bush,No. Its the right thing for the consumers. Less dependency upon foreign sources of crude is good for consumers. And we can do so in an environmentally friendly way.,2000-10-03,Republican
Gore,Well can I have the last word on this?,2000-10-03,Democrat
Moderator,"New question, new subject. Governor Bush. If elected president, would you try to overturn the FDAs approval last week of the abortion pill RU-486?",2000-10-03,Moderator
Bush,"I dont think a president can do that. I was disappointed in the ruling because I think abortions ought to be more rare in America, and Im worried that that pill will create more abortions and cause more people to have abortions. This is a very important topic and its a very sensitive topic, because a lot of good people disagree on the issue. I think what the next president ought to do is to promote a culture of life in America. Life of the elderly and life of those living all across the country. Life of the unborn. As a matter of fact, I think a noble goal for this country is that every child, born or unborn, need to be protected by law and welcomed to life. I know we need to change a lot of minds before we get there in America. What I do believe is that we can find good, common ground on issues of parental consent or parental notification. I know we need to ban partial birth abortions. This is a place where my opponent and I have strong disagreement. I believe banning partial birth abortions would be a positive step to reducing the number of abortions in America. This is an issue that will require a new attitude. Weve been battling over abortion for a long period of time. Surely this nation can come together to promote the value of life. Surely we can fight off these laws that will encourage doctors to  to allow doctors to take the lives of our seniors. Surely we can work together to create a cultural life so some of these youngsters who feel like they can take a neighbors life with a gun will understand that thats not the way America is meant to be. Surely we can find common ground to reduce the number of abortions in America. As to the drug itself, I mentioned I was disappointed. I hope the FDA took its time to make sure that American women will be safe who use this drug.",2000-10-03,Republican
Moderator,Vice President Gore?,2000-10-03,Moderator
Gore,"Well, Jim, the FDA took 12 years, and I do support that decision. They determined it was medically safe for the women who use that drug. This is indeed a very important issue. First of all on the issue of partial birth or so-called late-term abortion, I would sign a law banning that procedure, provided that doctors have the ability to save a womans life or to act if her health is severely at risk. Thats not the main issue. The main issue is whether or not the Roe v. Wade decision is going to be overturned. I support a womans right to choose. My opponent does not. It is important because the next president is going to appoint three and maybe even four justices of the Supreme Court. And Governor Bush has declared to the anti-choice groups that he will appoint justices in the mold of Scalia and Clarence Thomas, who are known for being the most vigorous opponents of a womans right to choose. Here is the difference. He trusts the government to order a woman to do what it thinks she ought to do. I trust women to make the decisions that affect their lives, their destinies and their bodies. And I think a womans right to choose ought to be protected and defended.",2000-10-03,Democrat
Moderator,"Governor, well go to the Supreme Court question in a moment, but make sure I understand your position on RU-486. If youre elected president, not through appointments to the FDA, you wont support legislation to overturn this?",2000-10-03,Moderator
Bush,I dont think a president can unilaterally overturn it. The FDA has made its decision.,2000-10-03,Republican
Moderator,"That means you wouldnt, through appointments, to the FDA and ask them to",2000-10-03,Moderator
Bush,"I think once a decision has been made, its been made unless its proven to be unsafe to women.",2000-10-03,Republican
Gore,"Jim, the question you asked, if I heard you correctly, was would he support legislation to overturn it. And if I heard the statement day before yesterday, you said you would order  he said he would order his FDA appointee to review the decision. Now that sounds to me a little bit different. I just think that we ought to support the decision.",2000-10-03,Democrat
Bush,I said I would make sure that women would be safe who used the drug.,2000-10-03,Republican
Moderator,On the Supreme Court question. Should a voter assume  youre pro-life.,2000-10-03,Moderator
Bush,I am pro-life.,2000-10-03,Republican
Moderator,"Should a voter assume that all judicial appointments you make to the supreme court or any other court, federal court, will also be pro-life?",2000-10-03,Moderator
Bush,"The voters should assume I have no litmus test on that issue or any other issue. Voters will know Ill put competent judges on the bench. People who will strictly interpret the Constitution and not use the bench to write social policy. That is going to be a big difference between my opponent and me. I believe that the judges ought not to take the place of the legislative branch of government. That theyre appointed for life and that they ought to look at the Constitution as sacred. They shouldnt misuse their bench. I dont believe in liberal activist judges. I believe in strict constructionists. Those are the kind of judges I will appoint. Ive named four supreme court justices in the State of Texas and would ask the people to check out their qualifications, their deliberations. Theyre good, solid men and women who have made good, sound judgments on behalf of the people of Texas.",2000-10-03,Republican
Moderator,What kind of appointments should they expect from you?,2000-10-03,Moderator
Gore,"We both use similar language to reach an exactly opposite outcome. I dont favor a litmus test, but I know that there are ways to assess how a potential justice interprets the Constitution. And in my view, the Constitution ought to be interpreted as a document that grows with our country and our history. And I believe, for example, that there is a right of privacy in the Fourth Amendment. And when the phrase a strict constructionist is used and when the names of Scalia and Thomas are used as the benchmarks for who would be appointed, those are code words, and nobody should mistake this, for saying the governor would appoint people who would overturn Roe v. Wade. Its very clear to me. I would appoint people that have a philosophy that I think would have it quite likely they would uphold Roe v. Wade.",2000-10-03,Democrat
Moderator,Is the vice president right? Is that a code word for overturning Roe v. Wade?,2000-10-03,Moderator
Bush,It sounds like the vice presidents not right very many times tonight. I just told you the criteria on which Ill appoint judges. I have a record of appointing judges in the State of Texas. Thats what a governor gets to do. A governor gets to name supreme court judges. He also reads all kinds of things into my tax plan and into my Medicare plan. I want the viewers out there to listen to what I have to say about it.,2000-10-03,Republican
Moderator,Reverse the question. What code phrases should we read by what you said about what kind of people you would appoint?,2000-10-03,Moderator
Gore,"It would be likely that they would uphold Roe v. Wade. I do believe its wrong to use a litmus test. If you look at the history of a lower court judges rulings, you can get a pretty good idea of how theyll interpret questions. A lot of questions are first impression, and these questions that have been seen many times come up in a new context and so  but, you know, this is a very important issue. Because a lot of young women in this country take this right for granted and it could be lost. It is on the ballot in this election, make no mistake about it.",2000-10-03,Democrat
Bush,"Ill tell you what kind of judges hell put on. Hell put liberal activists justices who will use their bench to subvert the legislature, thats what hell do.",2000-10-03,Republican

Moderator,"New subject, new question. Vice President Gore, if President Milosevic of Yugoslavia refuses to accept the election results and leave office, what action, if any, should the United States take to get him out of there?",2000-10-03,Moderator
Gore,"Well, Milosevic has lost the election. His opponent, Kostunica, has won the election. Its overwhelming. Milosevics government refuses to release the vote count. Theres now a general strike going on. Theyre demonstrating. I think we should support the people of Serbia and Yugoslavia, as they call the Serbia plus Montenegro, and put pressure in every way possible to recognize the lawful outcome of the election. The people of Serbia have acted very bravely in kicking this guy out of office. Now he is trying to not release the votes and then go straight to a so-called runoff election without even announcing the results of the first vote. Now, weve made it clear, along with our allies, that when Milosevic leaves, then Serbia will be able to have a more normal relationship with the rest of the world. That is a very strong incentive that weve given them to do the right thing. Bear in mind also, Milosevic has been indicted as a war criminal and he should be held accountable for his actions. Now, we have to take measured steps because the sentiment within Serbia is, for understandable reasons, against the United States because their nationalism  even if they dont like Milosevic, they still have some feelings lingering from the NATO action there. So we have to be intelligent in the way we go about it. But make no mistake about it, we should do everything we can to see that the will of the Serbian people expressed in this extraordinary election is done. And I hope that hell be out of office very shortly.",2000-10-03,Democrat
Moderator,"Governor Bush, one minute.",2000-10-03,Moderator
Bush,"Well, Im pleased with the results of the election. As the vice president is. Its time for the man to go. It means that the United States must have a strong diplomatic hand with our friends in NATO. Thats why its important to make sure our alliances are as strong as they possibly can be to keep the pressure on Mr. Milosevic. But this will be an interesting moment for the Russians to step up and lead as well. Be a wonderful time for the Russians to step into the Balkans and convince Mr. Milosevic that its in his best interest and his countrys best interest to leave office. The Russians have a lot of sway in that part of the world. We would like to see the Russians use that sway to encourage democracy to take hold. Its an encouraging election. Its time for the man to leave.",2000-10-03,Republican
Moderator,"What if he doesnt leave? What if all the diplomatic efforts, all the pressure from all over the world and he still doesnt go? Is this the kind of thing, to be specific, that you as president would consider the use of U.S. military force to get him gone?",2000-10-03,Moderator
Gore,"In this particular situation, no. Bear in mind that we have a lot of sanctions in force against Serbia right now. And the people of Serbia know that they can escape all those sanctions if this guy is turned out of power. Now, I understand what the governor has said about asking the Russians to be involved, and under some circumstances that might be a good idea. But being as they have not yet been willing to recognize Kostunica as the lawful winner of the election, Im not sure its right for us to invite the president of Russia to mediate this  this dispute there because we might not like the results that comes out of that. They currently favor going forward with a runoff election. I think thats the wrong thing. I think the governors instinct is not necessarily bad because we have worked with the Russians in a constructive way in Kosovo, for example, to end the conflict there. But I think we need to be very careful in the present situation before we invite the Russians to play the lead role in mediating.",2000-10-03,Democrat
Bush,"Well obviously we wouldnt use the Russians if they didnt agree with our answer, Mr. Vice President.",2000-10-03,Republican

Bush,No.,2000-10-03,Republican
Moderator,Why not?,2000-10-03,Moderator
Bush,Its not in our national interest to use force in this case. I would use pressure and diplomacy. There is a difference with what the president did in Kosovo which I supported and this. Its up to the people in this region to take control of their country.,2000-10-03,Republican
Moderator,"New question. How would you go about as president deciding when it was in the national interest to use U.S. force, generally?",2000-10-03,Moderator
Bush,"Well, if its in our vital national interests, and that means whether our territory is threatened or people could be harmed, whether or not the alliances are  our defense alliances are threatened, whether or not our friends in the Middle East are threatened. That would be a time to seriously consider the use of force. Secondly, whether or not the mission was clear. Whether or not it was a clear understanding as to what the mission would be. Thirdly, whether or not we were prepared and trained to win. Whether or not our forces were of high morale and high standing and well-equipped. And finally, whether or not there was an exit strategy. I would take the use of force very seriously. I would be guarded in my approach. I dont think we can be all things to all people in the world. I think weve got to be very careful when we commit our troops. The vice president and I have a disagreement about the use of troops. He believes in nation building. I would be very careful about using our troops as nation builders. I believe the role of the military is to fight and win war and therefore prevent war from happening in the first place. So I would take my responsibility seriously. And it starts with making sure we rebuild our military power. Morale in todays military is too low. Were having trouble meeting recruiting goals. We met the goals this year, but in the previous years we have not met recruiting goals. Some of our troops are not well-equipped. I believe were overextended in too many places. And therefore I want to rebuild the military power. It starts with a billion dollar pay raise for the men and women who wear the uniform. A billion dollars more than the president recently signed into law. Its to make sure our troops are well-housed and well-equipped. Bonus plans to keep some of our high-skilled folks in the services and a commander in chief who clearly sets the mission. The mission is to fight and win war and therefore prevent war from happening in the first place.",2000-10-03,Republican
Moderator,"Vice President Gore, one minute.",2000-10-03,Moderator
Gore,"Let me tell you what Ill do. First of all  I want to make it clear, our military is the strongest, best-trained, best-equipped, best-led fighting force in the world and in the history of the world. Nobody should have any doubt about that, least of all our adversaries or potential adversaries. If you entrust me with the presidency, I will do whatever is necessary in order to make sure our forces stay the strongest in the world. In fact, in my ten-year budget proposal Ive set aside more than twice as much for this purpose as Governor Bush has in his proposal. Now, I think we should be reluctant to get involved in someplace in a foreign country. But if our national security is at stake, if we have allies, if weve tried every other course, if were sure military action will succeed, and if the costs are proportionate to the benefits, we should get involved. Now, just because we dont want to get involved everywhere doesnt mean we should back off anywhere it comes up. I disagree with the proposal that maybe only when oil supplies are at stake that our national security is at risk. I think that there are situations like in Bosnia or Kosovo where theres a genocide, where our national security is at stake there.",2000-10-03,Democrat
Bush,"I agree our military is the strongest in the world today, thats not the question. The question is will it be the strongest in the years to come? The warning signs are real. Everywhere I go on the campaign trail I see moms and dads whose son or daughter may wear the uniform and they tell me about how discouraged their son or daughter may be. A recent poll was taken among 1,000 enlisted personnel, as well as officers, over half of whom will leave the service when their time of enlistment is up. The captains are leaving the service. There is a problem. And its going to require a new commander in chief to rebuild the military power. The other day I was honored to be flanked by Colin Powell and General Norman Schwartzkopf recently stood by me side and agreed with me. They said even if we are the strongest if we dont do something if we dont have a clear vision of the military, if we dont stop extending our troops all around the world and nation building missions, then were going to have a serious problem coming down the road, and Im going to prevent that. Im going to rebuild our military power. Its one of the major priorities of my administration.",2000-10-03,Republican
Moderator,"Vice President Gore, how should the voters go about deciding which one of you is better suited to make the kinds of decisions, whether its Milosevic or whatever, in the military and foreign policy area?",2000-10-03,Moderator
Gore,"Well, they should look at our proposals and look at us as people and make up their own minds. When I was a young man, I volunteered for the Army. I served my country in Vietnam. My father was a senator who strongly opposed the Vietnam War. I went to college in this great city, and most of my peers felt against the war as I did. But I went anyway because I knew if I didnt, somebody else in the small town of Carthage, Tennessee, would have to go in my place. I served for eight years in the House of Representatives and I served on the Intelligence Committee, specialized in looking at arms control. I served for eight years in the United States Senate and served on the Armed Services Committee. For the last eight years Ive served on the National Security Council, and when the conflict came up in Bosnia, I saw a genocide in the heart of Europe with the most violent war on the continent of Europe since World War II. Look, thats where World War I started in the Balkans. My uncle was a victim of poisonous gas there. Millions of Americans saw the results of that conflict. We have to be willing to make good, sound judgments. Incidentally, I know the value of making sure our troops have the latest technology. The governor has proposed skipping the next generation of weapons. I think thats a big mistake, because I think we have to stay at the cutting edge.",2000-10-03,Democrat
Moderator,"Governor, how would you advise the voters to make the decision on this issue?",2000-10-03,Moderator
Bush,"I think youve got to look at how one has handled responsibility in office. Whether or not its  the same in domestic policy as well. Whether or not you have the capacity to convince people to follow? Whether or not one makes decisions based on sound principles or whether or not you rely upon polls and focus groups on how to decide what the course of action is. We have too much polling and focus groups going on in Washington today. We need decisions made on sound principles. Ive been the governor of a big state. I think one of the hallmarks of my relationship in Austin, Texas, is that Ive had the capacity to work with both Republicans and Democrats. I think thats an important part of leadership. I think what it means to build consensus. Ive shown I know how to do so. Tonight in the audience theres one elected state senator who is a Democrat, a former state-wide officer who is a Democrat, a lot of Democrats who are here in the debate to  because they want to show their support that shows I know how to lead. And so the fundamental answer to your question, who can lead and whos shown the ability to get things done?",2000-10-03,Republican

When I was in the United States Congress, I worked with former President Reagan to modernize our strategic weaponry and to pursue arms control in a responsible way. When I was in the United States Senate I worked with former President Bush, your father. I was one of only a few Democrats in the Senate to support the Persian Gulf War. I think bipartisanship is a national asset. We have to find ways to reestablish it in foreign policy and national security policy.",2000-10-03,Democrat

Moderator,"New subject. New question. Should the voters of this election, Vice President Gore, see this in the domestic area as a major choice between competing political philosophies?",2000-10-03,Moderator
Gore,"Oh, absolutely. This is a very important moment in the history of our country. Look, weve got the biggest surpluses in all of American history. The key question that has to be answered in this election is will we use that prosperity wisely in a way that benefits all of our people and doesnt go just to the few. Almost half of all the tax cut benefits, as I said under Governor Bushs plan, go to the wealthiest 1%. I think we have to make the right and responsible choices. I think we have to invest in education, protecting the environment, health care, a prescription drug benefit that goes to all seniors, not just to the poor, under Medicare, not relying on HMOs and insurance companies. I think that we have to help parents and strengthen families by dealing with the kind of inappropriate entertainment material that families are just heart sick that their children are exposed to. I think weve got to have welfare reform taken to the next stage. I think that we have got to balance the budget every single year, pay down the national debt and, in fact, under my proposal the national debt will be completely eliminated by the year 2012. I think we need to put Medicare and Social Security in a lockbox. The governor will not put Medicare in a lockbox. I dont think it should be used as a piggy bank for other programs. I think it needs to be moved out of the budget and protected. Ill veto anything that takes money out of Social Security or Medicare for anything other than Social Security or Medicare. Now, the priorities are just very different. Ill give you a couple of examples. For every new dollar that I propose for spending on health care, Governor Bush spends $3 for a tax cut for the wealthiest 1%. Now, for every dollar that I propose to spend on education, he spends $5 on a tax cut for the wealthiest 1%. Those are very clear differences.",2000-10-03,Democrat

Bush,"The man is practicing fuzzy math again. Theres differences. Under Vice President Gores plan, he is going to grow the federal government in the largest increase since Lyndon Baines Johnson in 1965. Were talking about a massive government, folks. Were talking about adding to or increasing 200 programs, 20,000 new bureaucrats. Imagine how many IRS agents it is going to take to be able to figure out his targeted tax cut for the middle class that excludes 50 million Americans. There is a huge difference in this campaign. He says hes going to give you tax cuts. 50 million of you wont receive it. He said in his speech he wants to make sure the right people get tax relief. Thats not the role of a president to decide right and wrong. Everybody who pays taxes ought to get tax relief. After my plan is in place, the wealthiest Americans will pay a higher percentage of taxes then they do today, the poorest of Americans, six million families, wont pay any tax at all. Its a huge difference. A difference between big exploding federal government that wants to think on your behalf and a plan that meets priorities and liberates working people to be able to make decisions on your own.",2000-10-03,Republican
Gore,"Let me just say, Jim, you havent heard the governor deny these numbers. Hes called them phony and fuzzy. The fact remains almost 30% of his proposed tax cut goes to  only to Americans that make more than $1 million per year. More money goes to the  can I have a rebuttal here?",2000-10-03,Democrat

Secondly, if youre a family of four making $50,000 in Massachusetts, you get a 50% tax cut. Let me give you one example. The Strunk family in Allentown, Pennsylvania, I campaigned with them the other day. They make $51,000 combined income, they pay about $3500 in taxes. Under my plan, they get $1800 of tax relief. Under Vice President Gores plan, they get $145 of tax relief. Now you tell me who stands on the side of the fence. You ask the Strunks whose plan makes more sense. There is a difference of opinion. He would rather spend the familys $1800 and I would rather the Strunks spend their own money.",2000-10-03,Republican
Moderator,Do you see it that way Mr. Vice President?,2000-10-03,Moderator
Gore,"No, I dont, and Im not going to go to calling names on his facts. Im just gonna tell you what the real facts are. The analysis that hes talking about leaves out more than half of the tax cuts that I have proposed. And if you just add the numbers up, he still hasnt denied it, he spends more money on a tax cut for the wealthiest 1% than all his new proposals for prescription drugs, healthcare, education, and national defense combined. Now those are the wrong priorities. $665 billion over ten years for the wealthiest 1%. As I said, almost 30% of it goes to Americans that make more than $1 million per year. Every middle class family is eligible for a tax cut under my proposal. Let me give you some specific examples. I believe college tuition up to $10,000 per year ought to be tax deductible so middle-class families can choose to send their children to college. I believe all senior citizens should be able to choose their own doctors and get prescription drugs from their own pharmacists with Medicare paying half the bill. I believe parents ought to be able to make more choices need more public and charter school choice to send their kids always to a safe school. We need to make education the number one priority in our country and treat teachers like the professionals that they are. And thats why I have made it a number one priority in my budget, not a tax cut for the wealthy.",2000-10-03,Democrat
Bush,Let me talk about tax cuts one more time. This is a man whose plan excludes 50 million Americans.,2000-10-03,Republican
Gore,Not so.,2000-10-03,Democrat
Bush,"Take for example the marriage penalty. If you itemize your tax return, you get no marriage penalty relief. He picks and chooses. He decides who the right people are. Its a fundamental difference of opinion. I want my fellow Americans to hear one more time. Well spend $25 trillion  well collect $25 trillion in revenue in the next 10 years and spend $21 trillion. Surely we can send 5% back to you that pay the bills. Theres a problem wait. I want to say something, Jim. This man has been disparaging my plan with all this Washington fuzzy math. I want you to hear a problem weve got here in the USA. If youre a single mother making $22,000 a year and you have two children, under this tax code, for every additional dollar you make, you pay a higher marginal rate on that dollar than someone making more than $200,000 a year, and that is not right. My plan drops the rate from 15% to 10% and increases the child credit from $500 to $1,000 to make the code more fair for everybody, not just a few, not just a handful. Everybody who pays taxes ought to get some relief.",2000-10-03,Republican
Moderator,"Having cleared that up, were going to a new question. Education. Governor Bush. Both of you have promised dramatically to change  to change dramatically public education in this country. Of the public money spent on education, only 6% of that is federal money. You want to change 100% of the public education with 6% of the money, is that possible?",2000-10-03,Moderator
Bush,"We can make a huge difference by saying if you receive federal money we expect you to show results. Let me give you a story about public education, if I might. Its about Kipp Academy in Houston, Texas. A charter school run by some people from Teach For America. Young folks saying Im going to do something good for my country. I want to teach. A guy named Michael runs the school. It is a school full of so-called at-risk children. Its how we unfortunately label certain children. Basically it means they cant learn. Its a school of strong discipline and high standards. Its one of the best schools in Houston. Here are the key ingredients. High expectations, strong accountabily. What Michael says, dont put all these rules on us, just let us teach and hold us accountable for every grade. Thats what we do. And as a result, these mainly Hispanic youngsters are some of the best learners in Houston, Texas. Thats my vision for public education all around America. Many of you viewers dont know, but Laura and I sent our girls to public school. They went to Austin High School. And many of the public schools are meeting the call. But, unfortunately, a lot of schools are trapping children in schools that just wont teach and wont change. Here is the role of the federal government. One is to change Head Start to a reading program. Two is to say if you want to access reading money, you can do so. The goal is for every single child to learn to Read. there must by K-2 diagnostic teaching tools, teacher training money, available. Three, we have to consolidate the federal programs to free districts to free the schools and encourage innovators like Michael. Let them reach out beyond the confines of the current structure to recruit teach-for-the-children type teachers. Four, were going to say if you receive federal money, measure third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth grade. Show us if they are learning to read, write, add and subtract and if so there will be bonus plans. But if not, instead of continuing to subsidize failure, the money will go to  the federal money will go to the parents for public school or charter school or tutorial or Catholic school. What I care about is children. And so does Michael Feinberg. And you know what? It can happen in America with the right kind of leadership.",2000-10-03,Republican
Gore,"We agree on a couple of things on education. I strongly support new accountability, so does Governor Bush. I strongly support local control, so does Governor Bush. Im in favor of testing as a way of measuring performance. Every school and every school district, have every state test the children. Ive also proposed a voluntary national test in the fourth grade and eighth grade, and a form of testing the governor has not endorsed. I think that all new teachers ought to be tested in the subjects that they teach. Weve got to recruit 100,000 new teachers. And I have budgeted for that. Weve got to reduce the class size so that the student who walks in has more one-on-one time with the teacher. We ought to have universal pre-school and we ought to make college tuition tax deductible, up to $10,000 a year. I would like to tell you a quick story. I got a letter today as I left Sarasota, Florida. Im here with a group of 13 people from around the country who helped me prepare. We had a great time. Two days ago we ate lunch at a restaurant. The guy that served us lunch gave me a letter today. His name is Randy Ellis. He has a 15-year-old daughter named Caley, who is in Sarasota High School. Her science class was supposed to be for 24 students. Shes the 36th student in that classroom. They sent me a picture of her in the classroom. They cant squeeze another desk in for her, so she has to stand during class. I want the federal government, consistent with local control and new accountability, to make improvement of our schools the number one priority so Caley will have a desk and can sit down in a classroom where she can learn.",2000-10-03,Democrat
Moderator,"All right. So having heard the two of you, the voters have just heard the two of you, what is the difference? What is the choice between the two of you on education?",2000-10-03,Moderator
Bush,"The first is, the difference is there is no new accountability measures in Vice President Gores plan. He says hes for voluntary testing. You cant have voluntary testing. You must have mandatory testing. You must say that if you receive money you must show us whether or not children are learning to read and write and add and subtract. Thats the difference. You may claim youve got mandatory testing but you dont, Mr. Vice President. Thats a huge difference. Testing is the cornerstone of reform. You know how I know? Because its the cornerstone of reform in the State of Texas. Republicans and Democrats came together and said what can we do to make our public education the best in the country? Weve done a long way working together to do so. The cornerstone is to have strong accountability in return for money and in return for flexibility. Were going to ask you to show us whether or not  we ask you to post the results on the Internet. We encourage parents to take a look at the comparative results of schools. We have a strong charter school movement that I signed the legislation to get started in the State of Texas. I believe if we find poor children trapped in schools that wont teach, we need to free the parents. We need to expand education savings accounts. Something that the vice presidents running mate supports. Theres big differences. He wont support freeing local districts from the strings of federal money.",2000-10-03,Republican
Gore,"First of all, I do have mandatory testing. I think the governor may not have heard what I said clearly. The voluntary national testing is in addition to the mandatory testing that we require of states. All schools, all school districts, students themselves, and required teacher testing, which goes a step farther than Governor Bush has been willing to go. Here are a couple of differences, though, Jim. Governor Bush is in favor of vouchers which take taxpayer money away from public schools and give them to private schools that are not accountable for how the money is used and dont have to take all applicants. Now, private schools play a great role in our society. All of our children have gone to both public schools and private schools. But I dont think private schools should have a right to take taxpayer money away from public schools at a time when Caley Ellis is standing in that classroom. Let me give you another example. I went to a school in Dade County, Florida where the facilities are so overcrowded the children have to eat lunch in shifts with the first shift for lunch starting at 9:30 in the morning. Look, this is a funding crisis all around the country. There are fewer parents of school-age children as a percentage of the voting population and there is the largest generation of students ever. Were in an information age when learning is more important than ever. 90% of our kids go to public schools. We have to make it the number one priority. Modernize our schools, reduce class size, recruit new teachers, give every child a chance to learn with one-on-one time in a quality  high-quality, safe school. If its a failing school, shut it down and reopen it under a new principal with a turnaround team of specialists the way Governor Jim Hunt does in North Carolina. Here is another difference. The governor, if its a failing school, would leave the children in that failing school for three years and then give a little bit of money to the parents, a down payment on a down payment for private school tuition, and pretend that that would be enough for them to go out and go to a private school. Its an illusion.",2000-10-03,Democrat
Moderator,"Wait a minute, Governor.",2000-10-03,Moderator
Bush,"Okay. First of all, most of good governance is at the state level. See, here is the mentality. Im going to make the state do this and make the state do that. All Im saying is if you spend money, show us results and test every year, which you do not do, Mr. Vice President. You dont test every year. You can say you do to the cameras but you dont, unless youve changed your plan here on the stage.",2000-10-03,Republican
Gore,I didnt say that.,2000-10-03,Democrat
Bush,"You need to test every year. Thats how you determine if children are progressing to excellence. Secondly, one of the things that we have to be careful about in politics is throwing money at a system that has not yet been reformed. More money is needed and I spend more money, but step one is to make sure we reform the system to have the system in place that leaves no child behind. Stop this business about asking gosh, how old are you? If youre 10 well put you here, 12 you put here. Start asking the question, what do you know? If you dont know what youre supposed to know, well make sure you do early before its too late.",2000-10-03,Republican
Moderator,"New question. Weve been talking about a lot of specific issues. Its often said that in the final analysis about 90% of being the President of the United States is dealing with the unexpected, not with issues that came up in the campaign. Vice President Gore, can you point to a decision, an action you have taken, that illustrates your ability to handle the unexpected, the crisis under fire?",2000-10-03,Moderator
Gore,"When the action in Kosovo was dragging on and we were searching for a solution to the problem, our country had defeated the adversary on the battlefield without a single American life being lost in combat. But the dictator Milosevic was hanging on. I invited the former prime minister of Russia to my house and took a risk in asking him to get personally involved, along with the head of Finland, to go to Belgrade and to take a set of proposals from the United States that would constitute basically a surrender by Serbia. But it was a calculated risk that paid off. Now, I could probably give you some other examples of decisions over the last 24 years. I have been in public service for 24 years, Jim. And throughout all that time the people I have fought for have been the middle-class families, and I have been willing to stand up to powerful interests like the big insurance companies, the drug companies, the HMOs, the oil companies. They have good people and they play constructive roles sometimes, but sometimes they get too much power. I cast my lot with the people even when it means that you have to stand up to some powerful interests who are trying to turn the  the policies and the laws to their advantage. You can see it in this campaign. The big drug companies support Governor Bushs prescription drug proposal. They oppose mine because they dont want to get Medicare involved because theyre afraid that Medicare will negotiate lower prices for seniors who currently pay the highest prices of all.",2000-10-03,Democrat

Bush,"You know, as governor, one of the things you have to deal with is catastrophe. I can remember the fires that swept Parker County, Texas. I remember the floods that swept our state. I remember going down to Del Rio, Texas. I have to pay the administration a compliment. James Lee Witt of FEMA has done a really good job of working with governors during times of crisis. But thats the time when youre tested not only  its the time to test your mettle, a time to test your heart when you see people whose lives have been turned upside down. It broke my heart to go to the flood scene in Del Rio where a fellow and his family got completely uprooted. The only thing I knew to do was to get aid as quickly as possible with state and federal help, and to put my arms around the man and his family and cry with them. Thats what governors do. They are often on the front line of catastrophic situations.",2000-10-03,Republican
Moderator,"New question. There can be all kinds of crises, Governor. A questions for you. There could be a crisis, for instance, in the financial area, the stock market could take a tumble, there could be a failure of a major financial institution. What is your general attitude toward government intervention in such events?",2000-10-03,Moderator
Bush,"Well, it depends, obviously. But what I would do first and foremost, is I would get in touch with the Federal Reserve Chairman, Alan Greenspan, to find out all the facts and all the circumstances. I would have my Secretary of the Treasury be in touch with the financial centers not only here, but at home. I would make sure that key members of Congress were called in to discuss the gravity of the situation. And I would come up with a game plan to deal with it. Thats what governors end up doing. We end up being problem solvers. We come up with practical, common sense solutions for problems that were confronted with. In this case, in the case of a financial crisis, I would gather all the facts before I made the decision as to what the government ought or ought not to do.",2000-10-03,Republican
Moderator,Vice President Gore?,2000-10-03,Moderator

And FEMA has been a major flagship project of our reinventing government efforts. And I agree, it works extremely well now. On the international financial crises that come up, my friend, Bob Rubin, the former Secretary of Treasury is here, hes a close advisor to me and great friend in all respects. I have had a chance to work with him and Alan Greenspan and others on the crisis following the collapse of the Mexican peso. When the Asian financial crisis raised the risk of world-wide recession that could affect our economy, And now, of course, the euros value has been dropping, but seems to be under control. But it started for me in the last eight years when I had the honor of casting the tie-breaking vote to end the old economic plan here at home and put into place a new economic plan that has helped us to make some progress, 22 million new jobs, the greatest prosperity ever. But its not good enough. My attitude is you aint seen nothing yet. We need to do more and better.",2000-10-03,Democrat
Moderator,"So, Governor, would you agree there is no basic difference here on intervening  on federal government intervening in what might be seen by others to be a private financial crisis?",2000-10-03,Moderator
Bush,"No, theres no difference on that. There is a difference, though, as to what the economy has meant. I think the economy has meant more for the Gore and Clinton folks than the Gore and Clinton folks have meant for the economy. I think most of the economic growth that has taken place is a result of ingenuity and hard work and entrepreneurship and thats the role of goverment to encourage that. In terms of in response to the question, no.",2000-10-03,Republican
Gore,Can I comment on that?,2000-10-03,Democrat
Moderator,You may.,2000-10-03,Moderator
Gore,"You know, I think the American people deserve credit for the great economy that we have. Its their ingenuity, I agree with that. But you know, they were working pretty hard eight years ago. And now they had ingenuity eight years ago. The difference is weve got a new policy. And instead of concentrating on tax cuts mostly for the wealthy, we want  I want tax cuts for the middle-class families and I want to continue the prosperity and make sure that it enriches not just a few but all of our families. We have gone from the biggest deficits to the biggest surpluses. We have gone from a triple-dip recession during the previous 12 years to a tripling of the stock market. Instead of a high unemployment, we have the lowest African-American and Latin American unemployment rates in history and 22 million new jobs. Its not good enough. Too many people have been left behind. We have got to do much more. The key is job training, education, investments in health care and education, environment, retirement security. And incidentally, we have got to preserve Social Security. Im totally opposed to diverting one out of every six dollars out of the Social Security trust fund, as the Governor has proposed, into the stock market. I want new incentives for savings and investment for the young couples who are working hard so they can save and invest on their own on top of Social Security, not at the expense of Social Security, as the governor proposes.",2000-10-03,Democrat
Bush,"Two points. One, a lot of folks are still waiting for that 1992 middle-class tax cut. I remember the vice president saying, Just give us a chance to get up there, were going to make sure you get tax cuts. It didnt happen. Now hes having to say that again. Theyve had their chance to deliver a tax cut to you. Secondly, the surest way to bust this economy is to increase the role and size of the federal budget. The Senate Budget Committee did a study of the vice presidents expenditures. Its been projected that they could conceivably bust the budget by $900 billion. That means hell either have to raise your taxes by $900 billion or go into the Social Security surplus for $900 billion. This is a plan that is going to increase the bureaucracy by 20,000 people. His targeted tax cut is so detailed, so much fine print that it is going to require numerous IRS agents. We need somebody to simplify the code, to be fair, to continue prosperity by sharing some of the surplus with the people who pay the bills, particularly those at the bottom end of the economic ladder.",2000-10-03,Republican
Gore,"If I could respond, Jim. What hes quoting is not the Senate Budget Commiitte, it is a partisan press release by the Republicans on the Senate Budget Committee thats not worth the government  the taxpayer-paid paper that its printed on. Now, as for 20,000 new bureaucrats, as you call them, you know, the size of the federal government will go down in a Gore administration. In the reinventing government program you just look at the numbers. It is 300,000 people smaller today than it was eight years ago. Now, the fact is youre going to have a hard time convincing folks that we were a whole lot better off eight years ago than we are today. But thats not the question. The question is, will we be better off four years from now than we are today? And as for the surest way to threaten our prosperity, having a $1.9 trillion tax cut, almost half of which goes to the wealthy, and a $1 trillion Social Security privatization proposal is the surest way to put our budget into deficit  raise interest rates and put our prosperity at risk.",2000-10-03,Democrat
Bush,I cant let the man continue with fuzzy math. It is 1.3 trillion Mr. Vice President. It will go to everybody who pays taxes. Im not going to be the kind of president that says you get tax relief and you dont. Im not going to be a picker and chooser. What is fair is everybody who pays taxes ought to get relief.,2000-10-03,Republican
Moderator,"I thought we cleared this up a while ago. New question on Social Security. Both of you have Social Security reform plans, so we could spend the rest of the evening and two or three other evenings talking about them in detail. We wont do that. But",2000-10-03,Moderator
Gore,Suits me.,2000-10-03,Democrat
Moderator,"Many experts, including Federal Reserve Chairman Greenspan, Vice President Gore, say that it will be impossible for either of you, essentially, to keep the system viable on its own during the coming baby boomer retirement onslaught without either reducing benefits or increasing taxes. You disagree?",2000-10-03,Moderator
Gore,"I do disagree. Because if we can keep our prosperity going, if we can continue balancing the budget and paying down the debt, then the strong economy keeps generating surpluses. Here is my plan. I will keep Social Security in a lockbox and that pays down the national debt. And the interest savings I would put right back into Social Security. That extends the life of Social Security for 55 years. Now, I think that its very important to understand that cutting benefits under Social Security means that people like Winifred Skinner from Des Moines, Iowa, who is here, would really have a much harder time. Because there are millions of seniors who are living almost hand to mouth. And you talk about cutting benefits. I dont go along with it. I am opposed to it. Im also opposed to a plan that diverts 1 out of every $6 away from the Social Security Trust Fund. Social Security is a trust fund that pays the checks this year with the money that is paid into Social Security this year. The governor wants to divert 1 out of every $6 off into the stock market, which means that he would drain a trillion dollars out of the Social Security Trust Fund in this generation over the next ten years, and Social Security under that approach would go bankrupt within this generation. His leading advisor on this plan actually said that would be okay, because then the Social Security Trust Fund could start borrowing. It would borrow up to $3 trillion. Now, Social Security has never done that. And I dont think it should do that. I think it should stay in a lockbox, and Ill tell you this. I will veto anything that takes money out of Social Security for privatization or anything else other than Social Security.",2000-10-03,Democrat
Bush,"I thought it was interesting that on the two minutes he spent about a million-and-a-half on my plan, which means he doesnt want you to know what hes doing is loading up IOUs for future generations. He puts no real assets into the Social Security system. The revenues exceed the expenses in Social Security until the year 2015 which means all retirees are going to get the promises made. For those of you who he wants to scare into the voting booth to vote for him, hear me loud and clear. A promise made will be a promise kept. You bet we want to allow younger workers to take some of their own money. Thats the difference of opinion. The vice president thinks its the governments money. The payroll taxes are your money. You ought to put it in prudent, safe investments so that $1 trillion over the next ten years grows to be $3 trillion. The money stays within the Social Security system. Its a part of the Social Security system. He claims it will be out of Social Security. Its your money, its a part of your retirement benefit. Its a fundamental difference between what we believe. I want you to have your own asset that you can call your own. That you can pass on from one generation to the next. I want to get a better rate of return for your own money than the paltry 2% that the current Social Security Trust gets today. Mr. Greenspan I thought missed an opportunity to say theres a third way, and that is to get a better rate of return on the Social Security monies coming into the trust. There is $2.3 trillion of surplus that we can use to make sure that younger workers have a Social Security plan in the future. If were smart and if we trust workers and if we understand the power of the compounding rate of interest.",2000-10-03,Republican
Gore,"Here is the difference. I give a new incentive for younger workers to save their own money and invest their own money, but not at the expense of Social Security, on top of Social Security. My plan is Social Security plus. The governors plan is Social Security minus. Your future benefits would be cut by the amount thats diverted into the stock market. If you make bad investments, thats too bad. But even before then the problem hits because the money contributed to Social Security this year is an entitlement. Thats how it works. And the money is used to pay the benefits for seniors this year. If you cut the amount going in 1 out of every $6, then you have to cut the value of each check by 1 out of every $6 unless you come up with the money from somewhere else. I would like to know from the governor  I know were not supposed to ask each other questions  but Id be interested in knowing, does that trillion dollars come from the trust fund, or does it come from the rest of the budget?",2000-10-03,Democrat
Bush,"No. Theres enough money to pay seniors today in the current affairs of Social Security. The trillion comes from the surplus. Surplus is money  more money than needed. Let me tell you what your plan is. Its not Social Security plus, its Social Security plus huge debt. That is what it is. You leave future generations with tremendous IOUs. Its time to have a leader that doesnt put off tomorrow what we should do today. Its time to have somebody to step up and say look, lets let younger workers take some of their own money and under certain guidelines invest it in the private markets. The safest of federal investments yields 4%. Thats twice the amount of rate of return than the current Social Security Trust. Its a fundamental difference of opinion here, folks. Younger worker after younger worker hears my call that says I trust you. And you know what, the issue is changing. Seniors now understand that the promise made will be a promise kept, but younger workers now understand we better have a government that trusts them and thats exactly what Im going to do.",2000-10-03,Republican

If you take it out of the surplus in the trust fund, that means the trust fund goes bankrupt in this generation within 20 years.",2000-10-03,Democrat
Bush,"This is a government that thinks a 2% rate of return on your money is satisfactory. Its not. This is a government that says younger workers cant possibly have their own assets. We need to think differently about the issue. We need to make sure our seniors get the promise made. If we dont trust younger workers to manage some of their own money with the Social Security surplus, to grow from $1 trillion to $3 trillion, it will be impossible to bridge the gap without it.

I felt like there needed to be a better sense of responsibility of what was going on in the White House. I believe that  I believe theyve moved that sign, The buck stops here from the Oval Office desk to The buck stops here on the Lincoln bedroom. Its not good for the country and its not right. We need to have a new look about how we conduct ourselves in office. Theres a huge trust. I see it all the time when people come up to me and say, I dont want you to let me down again. And we can do better than the past administration has done. Its time for a fresh start. Its time for a new look. Its time for a fresh start after a season of cynicism.

Im asking you to see me for who I really am. Im offering you my own vision, my own experience, my own proposals. And incidentally, one of them is this. This current campaign financing system has not reflected credit on anybody in either party. And thats one of the reasons Ive said before, and Ill pledge here tonight, if Im president, the very first bill that Joe Lieberman and I will send to the United States Congress is the McCain-Feingold campaign finance reform bill. And the reason its that important is that all of the other issues, whether prescription drugs for all seniors that are opposed by the drug companies or the patients bill of rights to take the decisions away from the HMOs and give them to the doctors and nurses, opposed by the HMOs and insurance companies, all these other proposals are going to be a lot easier to get passed for the American people if we limit the influence of special interest money and give democracy back to the American people. And I wish Governor Bush would join me this evening in endorsing the McCain-Feingold Campaign Finance Reform Bill.",2000-10-03,Democrat
Bush,"You know, this man has no credibility on the issue. As a matter of fact, I read in the New York Times where he said he co-sponsored the McCain-Feingold Campaign Fundraising Bill. But he wasnt in the Senate with Senator Feingold. And so, look, Im going to  what you need to know about me is I will uphold the law, Im going to have an attorney general that enforces the law. The time for campaign funding reform is after the election. This man has outspent me and the special interests are outspending me. And I am not going to lay down my arms in the middle of the campaign for somebody who has got no credibility on the issue.",2000-10-03,Republican
Moderator,"Senator McCain  hold on one second. Senator McCain said in August, It doesnt matter which one of you is President of the United States in January, there is going to be blood on the floor of the United States Senate, and hell tie up the Senate until campaign finance reform is passed that includes a ban on soft money. First of all, would you support that effort by him, or would you sign a bill that is finally passed that included",2000-10-03,Moderator
Bush,"I would support an effort to ban corporate soft money and labor union soft money so long as there was dues check-off. Ive campaigned on this since the primaries. I believe there needs to be instant disclosure on the Internet as to who has given to who. I think we need to fully enforce the law. I think we need to have an attorney general that says if a law is broken, well enforce it. Be strict and firm about it.",2000-10-03,Republican
Gore,"Look, Governor Bush, you have attacked my character and credibility and I am not going to respond in kind. I think we ought to focus on the problems and not attack each other. One of the serious problems, hear me well, is that our system of government is being undermined by too much influence coming from special interest money. We have to get a handle on it. And like John McCain, I have learned from experience, and its not a new position for me. 24 years ago I supported full public financing of all federal elections. And anybody who thinks Im just saying it, it will be the first bill I send to the Congress. I want you to know I care passionately about this and I will fight until it becomes law.",2000-10-03,Democrat
Bush,"I want people to hear what he just said. He is for full public financing of Congressional elections. Im absolutely, adamently opposed to that. I dont want the government financing congressional elections.",2000-10-03,Republican

Bush,"Thank you, Jim. Thank the University of Massachusetts and Mr. Vice President, thank you. It has been a good, lively exchange. There is a huge difference of opinion. Mine is I want to empower people in their own lives. I also want to go to Washington to get some positive things done. It is going to require a new spirit. A spirit of cooperation. It will require the ability of a Republican president to reach out across the partisan divide and to say to Democrats, lets come together to do what is right for America. Its been my record as Governor of Texas, it will be how I conduct myself if Im fortunate enough to earn your vote as President of the United States. I want to finally get something done on Medicare. I want to make sure prescription drugs are available for all seniors. And I want seniors to have additional choices when it comes to choosing their health care plans. I want to finally get something done on Social Security. I want to make sure the seniors have the promise made will be a promise kept, but I want younger workers to be able to manage some of their own money, some of their own payroll taxes in the private sector under certain guidelines to get a better rate of return on your own money. I want to rebuild our military to keep the peace. I want to have a strong hand when it comes to the United States in world affairs. I dont want to try to put our troops in all places at all times. I dont want to be the worlds policeman, I want to be the worlds peacemaker by having a military of high morale and a military that is well-equipped. I want anti-ballistic missile systems to protect ourselves and our allies from a rogue nation that may try to hold us hostage or blackmail our allies and friends. I want to make sure the education system fulfills its hope and promise. Ive had a strong record of working with Democrats and Republicans in Texas to make sure no child is left behind. I understand the limited role of the federal government, but it could be a constructive role when it comes to reform, by insisting that there be a strong accountability systems. My intentions are to earn your vote and earn your confidence. Im asking for your vote. I want you to be on my team. And for those of you working, thanks from the bottom of my heart. For those of you making up your mind, I would be honored to have your support.",2000-10-03,Republican

Gore,"I want to thank everybody who watched and listened tonight because this is indeed a crucial time in American history. Were at a fork in the road. We have this incredible prosperity, but a lot of people have been left behind. And we have a very important decision to make. Will we use the prosperity to enrich all of our families and not just a few? One important way of looking at this is to ask who are you going to fight for? Throughout my career in public service, I have fought for the working men and women of this country, middle-class families. Why? Because you are the ones who have the hardest time paying taxes, the hardest time making ends meet. You are the ones who are making car payments and mortgage payments and doing right by your kids. And a lot of times there are powerful forces that are against you. Make no mistake about it, they do have undue influence in Washington, D.C. and it makes a difference if you have a president who will fight for you. I know one thing about the position of president, its the only position in our Constitution that is filled by an individual who is given the responsibility to fight not just for one state or one district or the well-connected or wealthy, but to fight for all of the people, including especially those who most need somebody who will stand up and take on whatever powerful forces might stand in the way. There is a woman named Winifred Skinner here tonight from Iowa. I mentioned her earlier. Shes 79 years old. She has Social Security. Im not going to cut her benefits or support any proposal that would. She gets a small pension, but in order to pay for her prescription drug benefits, she has to go out seven days a week several hours a day picking up cans. She came all the way from Iowa in a Winnebago with her poodle in order attend here tonight. I want to tell her, Ill fight for a prescription drug benefit for all seniors and fight for the people of this country for a prosperity that benefits all.",2000-10-03,Democrat

Moderator,"From historic Danville, Kentucky, good evening, and welcome to this years only vice presidential debate sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates. Im Bernard Shaw of CNN, moderator. Tonight we come to you from Newlin hall in the Norton Center for the Arts on the campus of Centre College. To President John Rausch, the faculty, students and community leaders state-wide, we thank you for hosting this debate. The candidates are the Republican nominee, former Defense Secretary Dick Cheney of Wyoming, and the Democratic nominee, Senator Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut. The Commission, these candidates and their campaign staffs have agreed to the following rules. A candidate shall have two minutes to respond to the moderators question. The other candidate shall have two minutes to comment on the question or the first candidates answer. When I exercise the moderators discretion of extending discussion of a question, no candidate may speak for more than two minutes at one time. This audience has been told no disruptions will be tolerated. A prior coin toss has determined that the first question will go to the Democratic candidate. Senator, few hard working Americans would base their well-being on bonuses they hope to get five or ten years from now. Why do you, and you, Secretary Cheney, predict surpluses you cannot possibly guarantee to pay for your proposed programs?",2000-10-05,Moderator
Lieberman,"Before I answer that very important question, let me first thank you for moderating the debate. Let me thank the wonderful people here at Centre College and throughout Kentucky for being such gracious hosts, and let me give a special thank you to the people of Connecticut without whose support over these last 30 years I would never have had the opportunity Al Gore has given me this year. And finally let me thank my family that is here with me. My wife, Hadassah, our children, our siblings and my mom. My 85-year-old mom gave me some good advice about the debate earlier today. She said, sweetheart  as shes prone to call me  remember, be positive and know that I will love you no matter what youre opponent says about you. Well, Mom, as always, that was both reassuring and wise. I am going to be positive tonight. Im not going to indulge in negative personal attacks. Im going to talk about the issues that matter to the people of this country; education, health care, retirement security and moral values. Im going to describe the plan that Al Gore and I have for keeping Americas prosperity going and making sure that it benefits more of Americas families, particularly the hard-working middle class families who have not yet fully benefitted from the good times weve had. And Bernie, Im going to explain tonight how were going to do all this and remain fiscally responsible. Let me get to your question.",2000-10-05,Democrat

Cheney,"Good. I think this is an extraordinarily important decision well make on November 7th. Were really going to choose between what I consider to be an old way of governing ourselves of high levels of spending, high taxes, ever more intrusive bureaucracy or a new course, a new era, if you will. And Governor Bush and I want to offer that new course of action. With respect to the surplus, Bernie, we have to make some kind of forecast. We cant make 12-month decisions in this business. Were talking about the kinds of fundamental changes in programs and government that are going to affect peoples lives for the next 25 or 30 years. And while it may be a little risky in some respects from an economic standpoint to try to forecast surpluses, I think we have to make some planning assumption to proceed. We care a great deal about the issues at stake here. One of the difficulties we have, frankly, for the last eight years we ignored a lot of these problems. We havent moved aggressively on Social Security, on Medicare. There are important issues out there that need to be resolved. Its important for us to get on with that business. Thats what Governor Bush and I want to do.",2000-10-05,Republican
Moderator,"You alluded to problems. Theres no magic bullet  Secretary Cheney, in this question to you  no magic bullets to solve the problems of public education. What is the next best solution?",2000-10-05,Moderator
Cheney,"I think public education is a solution. Our desire is to find ways to reform our educational system, to return it to its former glory. Im a product of public schools, my family, wife and daughters all went to public schools. We believe very much in the public school system. But if you look at where we are from the standpoint of the nation, recent exams. For example, the National Assessment of Educational Progress, an independent testing service, shows theres been no progress on reading scores in the last eight years. Almost no progress on math. The achievement gap between minority and non-minority students is as big as its ever been. Weve had a significant increase in spending for education nationwide, but it has produced almost no positive results. Thats unacceptable from our standpoint. If you look at it and think about it, we now have in our most disadvantaged communities, 70% of our fourth graders cant read at the basic level of understanding. Weve graduated 15 million kids from high school in the last few years who cant read at a significant level. They are permanently sentenced to a lifetime of failure. What we want to do is to change that. We think we know how to do it. Governor Bush has done it in Texas. We want to emphasize local control so that people here in Danville, KY decide what is best for their kids. We want to insist on high standards. One of the worst things we can do is fail to establish high standards, in effect to say to a youngster because of their ethnic background or income level, we dont have the same kind of expectations from you that we have from everybody else. We want accountability. We have to test every child every year to know whether or not were making progress with respect to achieving those goals and objectives. We think its extraordinarily important. Probably the single most important issue in this campaign. Governor Bush has made it clear that when hes elected this will be his number one priority as a legislative measure to submit to the Congress.",2000-10-05,Republican
Moderator,Senator.,2000-10-05,Moderator
Lieberman,"Al Gore and I are committed to making Americas public schools the best in the world. I disagree with what my opponent has said. A lot of progress has been made in recent years. Average testing scores are up and a lot of extraordinary work is being done by tens of thousands of parents, teachers and administrators all around America. There is more to be done. If youll allow me, I want to go back to your last question. It leads to this question. I think both of us agree that leaving aside the Social Security and Medicare surpluses, theres $1.8 trillion in surplus available to spend over the next ten years. As I said before were being fiscally responsible about it. Were taking $300 billion off the top to put in reserve fund. The rest well use for middle class tax cuts and invest in programs like education. Theres a big difference between these two tickets. Our opponents are going to spend $1.6 trillion of the $1.8 trillion surplus projected on that big tax cut that Al Gore talked about the other night so effectively. Were saving money to invest in education. You cannot reform education and improve it in this country without spending some money. Al Gore and I have committed $170 billion for that purpose. To recruit 100,000 new teachers to reduce the size of classrooms. To help local school districts build new buildings so our children are not learning in crumbling classrooms. And were not just going to stop at high school. Were going to go on and give the middle class the ability to deduct up to $10,000 a year in the cost of college tuition. Now, that is a tremendous life-saving change which will help people carry on their education and allow them to develop the kinds of skills that will help them succeed in the hi-tech economy of today.",2000-10-05,Democrat

Moderator,Of course you do. The secretary will have two minutes and then youll have two minutes.,2000-10-05,Moderator
Cheney,"Lets talk about this question of the surplus because it drives a lot of what were talking about here, Joe. If you look at our proposal, we take half of the projected surplus and set it aside for Social Security. Over $2.4 trillion. We take roughly a fourth of it for other urgent priorities such as Medicare reform and education, several of these other key programs we want to support. And we take roughly one-fourth of it and return it in the form of a tax cut to the American taxpayer. We think its extraordinarily important to do that. It is a fundamental difference between our two approaches. If you look, frankly, by our numbers and the numbers of the Senate Budget Committee, which has totaled up all the promises that Vice President Gore has made during the course of the campaign, they are some $900 billion in spending over and above that surplus already and we still have a month to go in the campaign. The fact is that the program that we put together we think is very responsible. Suggestion that somehow all of it is going for tax cuts isnt true. Another way to look at it is over the course of the next ten years well collect roughly $25 trillion in revenue. We want to take about 5% of that and return that to the American taxpayer in the form of tax relief. We have the highest level of taxation now weve had since World War II. The average American family is paying about 40% in federal, state and local taxes. We think it is appropriate to return to the American people so that they can make choices themselves in how that money ought to be spent; whether on education, retirement or on paying their bills. It is their choice and it is their prerogative. We want to give them the opportunity to make those kinds of choices for themselves and we think this is a totally reasonable approach.",2000-10-05,Republican
Moderator,Senator?,2000-10-05,Moderator
Lieberman,"Let me start with the numbers. With all due respect, the Senate Budget Committee estimates that Dick Cheney has just referred to are the estimates of the partisan Republican staff of the Senate Budget Committee. Were using the numbers presented by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. We start with an agreement which is this surplus in the Social Security fund should be locked up and used for Social Security. Thats where the agreement ends. We also agree and believe and pledge that the surplus in the Medicare trust fund should also be locked up with a sign on it that says politicians keep your hands off. Our opponents do not do that. In fact, they raid the Medicare trust fund to pay for, well, their tax cut and other programs that they cant afford because theyve spent so much on the tax cut. Let me come back to the remaining $1.8 trillion that we both talked about. The numbers show that $1.6 trillion goes to the big tax cut which, as Al Gore said the other night, sends 43% to the top 1%. Worse than that, when you add on the other spending programs that our opponents have committed to, plus the cost of their plan to privatize Social Security, by our calculations theyre $1.1 trillion in debt. That means we go back down the road to higher interest rates, to higher unemployment, to a kind of self-tax increase on every American family. Because when interest rates go up, so, too, do the cost of mortgage payments, car payments, student loans, credit card transactions. So if weve learned anything over the last eight years, it is that one of the most important things the government can do, the federal government, probably the most important, is to be fiscally responsible. And thats why Al Gore and I are committed to balancing the budget every year. In fact, the paying off the debt by the year 2012, when by our calculation our opponents economic plan still leaves America $2.8 trillion in debt.",2000-10-05,Democrat
Moderator,"Time. The next question goes to you. Gentlemen, this is the 21st Century. Yet on average an American working woman in our great nation earns 75 cents for each $1 earned by a working male. What do you males propose to do about it?",2000-10-05,Moderator
Lieberman,"Its a good and important question. Obviously in our time, fortunately, great advances have been made by women achieving the kind of equality that they were too long denied. Bernie, your question is absolutely right. Women  actually the number I have received 72 cents for every $1 a man receives in a comparable job. Al Gore and I have issued an economic plan in which weve stated specific goals for the future. And one of those goals is to eliminate the pay gap between men and women. Its unfair and its unacceptable. And the first way we will do that is by supporting the Equal Pay Act which has been proposed in Congress which gives women the right to file legal actions against employers who are not treating them fairly and not paying them equally. Secondly, were going to do everything we can using governmental support of business agencies such as the Small Business Administration to help women business owners have an opportunity to invest and begin businesses and make larger incomes themselves. And there are other civil rights and human rights laws that I think can come to play here. So bottom line, this is an unfair and unacceptable situation. And even though, as the economy has risen in the last eight years, Americas women have risen with it and received more income, until women are receiving the same amount of pay for the same job theyre doing as a man receives, weve not achieved genuine equality in this country. Al Gore and I are committed to closing that gap and achieving that equality. In so many families women are a significant bread earner or the only bread earner. So this cause affects not only the women, but families and the children as well.",2000-10-05,Democrat
Moderator,Mr. Secretary.,2000-10-05,Moderator
Cheney,"I share the view that we ought to have equal pay for equal work regardless of someones gender. We have made progress in recent years, but I think we have a ways to go. Its not just about the differential with respect to women. If you look at our opponents tax proposal, they discriminate between stay-at-home moms with children that they take care of themselves and those who go to work or who, in fact, have their kids taken care of outside the home. You, in effect, as a stay-at-home mom get no tax advantage under the Gore tax plan as contrasted with the Bush proposal. It provides tax relief for absolutely everybody who pays taxes. Its important to understand the things were trying to change and address in the course of the campaign and what our agenda is for the future, our plans are for the future, focus very much about giving as much control as we can to individual Americans, be they men or women, be they single or married, as much control as possible over their own lives, especially in the area of taxation. We want to make certain that the American people have the ability to keep more of what they earn and then they can get to decide how to spend it. The proposal we have from Al Gore, basically, doesnt do that. It in effect lays out some 29 separate tax credits. If you live your life the way they want you to live your life, if you behave in a certain way, you qualify for a tax credit and at that point you get some relief. Bottom line, though, is 50 million American taxpayers out there get no advantages at all out of the Gore tax proposal, whereas under the Bush plan everybody who pays taxes will get tax relief.",2000-10-05,Republican
Lieberman,Might I have an opportunity to respond?,2000-10-05,Democrat
Moderator,"You can respond senator. But I caution you gentlemen if you do this consistently we wont cover a lot of topics. After the Senator responds, you dont have to feel compelled to respond to the Senator.",2000-10-05,Moderator
Cheney,Depends on what he says.,2000-10-05,Republican
Lieberman,"This is an important difference between us. I want to clarify it briefly if I can. The first thing is the tax relief program that weve proposed, one of the many tax credits for the middle class includes a $500 tax credit for stay-at-home moms just as a way of saying we understand that you are performing a service for our society. We want you to have that tax credit. Second, the number of 50 million Americans not benefitting from our tax cut program is absolutely wrong. Its an estimate done on an earlier form of our tax cut program and its just plain wrong. And secondly, although Governor Bush says that his tax cut program, large as it is, gives a tax cut to everybody, as the newspapers indicated earlier this week, the Joint Committee on Taxation, again a nonpartisan group in Congress, says that 27 million Americans dont get what the governor said they would in the tax program. Al Gore and I want to live within our means. Were not going to give it all away in one big tax cut and certainly not to the 1% of the public that doesnt need it now. Were focusing our tax cut on the middle class in the areas they tell us they need it. Tax credits for better and more expensive child care, tax credits for middle class families that dont have health insurance from their employers. The tax deduction I talked about earlier. Very exciting deduction for up to $10,000 a year in the cost of a college tuition. A $3,000 tax credit for the cost  well, actually for a family member who stays home with a parent or grandparent who is ill. And a very exciting tax credit program that I hope Ill have a chance to talk about later, Bernie, that encourages savings by people early in life and any time in life by having the federal government match savings for the 75 million Americans who make $100,000 or less up to $2,000 a year. Very briefly, if a young couple making $50,000 a year saves $1,000, the government will put another $1,000 in that account. By the time they retire, theyll not only have guaranteed Social Security, but more than $200,000 in that retirement fund. Now, thats",2000-10-05,Democrat
Moderator,"Your time is up, Senator.",2000-10-05,Moderator
Cheney,"You have to be a CPA to understand what he just said. The fact of the matter is the plan is so complex that the ordinary American is never going to ever figure out what they even qualify for. Its a classic example of wanting to have a program, in this case a tax program, that will, in fact, direct people to live their lives in certain ways rather than empowering them to make decisions for themselves. It is a big difference between us. They like tax credits, we like tax reform and tax cuts.",2000-10-05,Republican
Moderator,"Mr. Secretary, this question is for you. Would you support the effort of House Republicans who want legislation to restrict distribution of the abortion drug RU-486?",2000-10-05,Moderator
Cheney,"The abortion issue is a very tough one, without question, and a very important one. Governor Bush and I have emphasized while, while we are clearly both pro-life, thats what we believe. We want to reduce the incidence of abortion on our society. Many on the pro-choice side have said the same thing. Even Bill Clinton has advocated reducing abortion to make it as rare as possible. With respect to the question of RU-486, we believe that  of course, that its recently been approved by the FDA. That really was a question of whether or not it was safe to be used by women. They didnt address the sort of the question of whether or not there should or should not be abortion in the society so much as evaluate that particular drug. What we would like to be able to do is to look for ways to reach across the divide between the two points of view and find things that we can do together to reduce the incidence of abortion. Such things as promoting adoption as an alternative. Encouraging parental notification. And we also think banning the horrific practice of partial birth abortions is an area where there could be agreement. Congress has twice passed by overwhelming margins, a significant number of votes from both parties, the ban on partial birth abortions. Twice its been vetoed by Bill Clinton and Al Gore. We would hope eventually they would recognize thats not a good position for them to be in. With respect to the RU-486 proposal, at this stage I havent looked in particular at that particular piece of legislation. Governor Bush made it clear the other night he did not anticipate that he would be able to go in and direct the FDA to reverse course on that particular issue, primarily because the decision they made was on the drug, not the question of whether or not it would support abortion.",2000-10-05,Republican
Lieberman,"Its a very important question and one on which these two tickets have dramatically different points of view. My answer is no, I would not support legislation that is being introduced in Congress to override the Food and Drug Administration decision on RU-486. The administration, FDA worked 12 years on this serious problem. They made a judgment based on what was good for womens health. A doctor has to pescribe and care for a woman using it. I think its a decision we ought to let stand because it was made by experts. But let me say more generally that the significant difference here on this issue is that Al Gore and I respect and will protect a womans right to choose. Our opponents will not. We know that this is a difficult personal, moral, medical issue, but that is exactly why it ought to be left under our law to a woman, her doctor and her God. Now, one area in which we agree, Al Gore and I, we believe that the government ought to do everything it can to reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies. And, therefore, the number of abortions. Incidentally, here there is good news to report. The number of abortions is actually down in America over the last eight years. In fact, over the last eight years the number of teenage pregnancies has dropped 20%. And the reason it has is that there are good programs out there that Al Gore and I will continue to support, such as family planning and programs that encourage abstinence. But when the health of a woman is involved, I think the government has to be respectful. I supported, in fact, a bill in the Senate that would have prohibited late-term abortions except in cases where the health or life of the mother was involved. I did not support the so-called partial birth abortion bill because it would have prohibited that form of abortion at any stage of the pregnancy regardless of the effect on the health and life of the woman. Thats unacceptable.",2000-10-05,Democrat
Moderator,"This question is for you, Senator. If Yugoslavias Slobodan Milosevic prevails, notwithstanding the election results, would you support his overthrow?",2000-10-05,Moderator
Lieberman,"Well, theres good news from Belgrade today, Bernie, as you know. Its unconfirmed. The encouraging news is that the state news agency is reporting that Mr. Kostunica is the president-elect. There are some press reports that are unconfirmed that say that Milosevic has actually left Belgrade. That is a very happy ending to a terrible story. Its the end of a reign of terror. If that is not confirmed and does not happen, then I think the United States, with its European allies, ought to do everything we can to encourage the people of Serbia to do exactly what theyve been doing over the last few days to rise up and end this reign of terror by Milosevic, and bring themselves back into the family of nations where they will be welcomed by the United States and others. You know, Im very proud on this night as it appears that Milosevic is about to or has fallen, of the leadership role the United States played in the effort to stop his aggression and genocide in Bosnia and Kosovo. I know our opponents have said they thought it was overreaching. It wasnt. It was a matter of principle in Americas national interest and values. The fact is that we stopped the aggression, we stopped the genocide, and therefore strengthened our relationship with our European allies in NATO. And, in fact, made the United States more respected and trusted by our allies and more feared by our enemies. I think that Vice President Gore played a critical role, passionate purposive role in leading the administration, along with Republican supporters like Bob Dole and John McCain, to do the right thing in the Balkans. And hopefully tonight were seeing the final results of that bold and brave effort.",2000-10-05,Democrat
Moderator,Secretary Cheney.,2000-10-05,Moderator
Cheney,"I noted, Bernie, like Joe, Im pleased to see what happened in Yugoslavia today. I hope it marks the end of Milosevic. I think probably more than anything else its a victory for the Serbian people. Theyve taken to the streets to support their democracy, to support their vote. In some respects this is a continuation of a process that began ten years ago all across eastern Europe and has only now arrived in Serbia. We saw it in Germany, we saw it in Rumania, we saw it in Czechoslovakia, as the people of eastern Europe rose up and made their claim for freedom. And I think we all admire that. I think with respect to how this process has been managed most recently, we want to do everything we can to support Mr. Milosevics departure. Certainly, though, that would not involve committing U.S. troops. I do think its noteworthy that there appears to be an effort underway to get the Russians involved. I noted the other night, for example, Tuesday night at the debate in Boston, Governor Bush suggested exactly that we ought to try to get the Russians involved to exercise some leverage over the Serbians. Its now clear from the press that, in fact, thats exactly what they were doing. Its  Governor Bush was correct in his assessment and his recommendation. He has supported the administration on Kosovo. He lobbied actively against passage of the Byrd-Warner provision which would have set a specific deadline, one he felt was too soon, for forcing the U.S. troops out. Hes been supportive of the policy that weve seen with respect to Yugoslavia. And I think he deserves a lot of credit for that. I would go beyond that. I think this is an opportunity for the United States to test President Putin of Russia. That in fact now is the time we ought to find out whether hes committed to democracy. Whether or not hes willing to support the forces of freedom and democracy diplomatically there in the area of eastern Europe. And its a test for him whether he represents the old guard in the Soviet Union. One of the most important challenges we face as a nation is how we manage that process of integrating those 150 million eastern Europeans into the security and economic framework of Europe.",2000-10-05,Republican
Moderator,"Your question, Mr. Secretary. You and Governor Bush charge the Clinton-Gore administration have presided over the deterioration and overextension of Americas armed forces. Should U.S. military personnel be deployed as warriors or peacekeepers?",2000-10-05,Moderator
Cheney,"My preference is to deploy them as warriors. There may be occasion when its appropriate to use them in a peacekeeping role, but I think the role ought to be limited, there ought to be a time limit on it. The reason we have a military is to be able to fight and win wars. And to maintain with sufficient strength so that would-be adversaries are deterred from ever launching a war in the first place. I think that the administration has, in fact, in this area failed in a major responsibility. Weve seen a reduction in our forces far beyond anything that was justified by the end of the Cold War. At the same time weve seen a rapid expansion of our commitments around the world as troops have been sent hither and yon. There was testimony before the Joint Chiefs of Staff before the Armed Services Committee that pointed out a lot of these problems. For example General Mike Ryan of the Air Force with 40% fewer aircraft, hes now undertaking three times as many deployments on a regular basis as he had to previously. Were overcommitted and underresourced. This has had some other unfortunate effects. I saw a letter the other day from a young captain stationed in Fort Bragg, a graduate of West Point in 95 getting ready to get out of the service because hes only allowed to train with his troops when fuel is available for the vehicles and only allowed to fire their weapons twice a year. Hes concerned that if he had to send them into combat it would mean lives lost. That is a legitimate concern, this is a very important area. The fact that the U.S. military is worse off today than it was eight years ago. Major responsibility for us in the future, a high priority for myself and Governor Bush to rebuild the U.S. military and to give them the resources they need to do the job we ask them to do for us and give them good leadership.",2000-10-05,Republican
Moderator,"Senator, youre shaking your head in disagreement.",2000-10-05,Moderator
Lieberman,"I am. I want to assure the American people that the American military is the best-trained, best-equipped, most powerful force in the world. And that Al Gore and I will do whatever it takes to keep them that way. Its not right, and its not good for our military, to run them down essentially in the midst of a partisan political debate. The fact is that youve got to judge the military by what the military leaders say. Secretary Bill Cohen, a good republican, and Gen. Shelton the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, will both tell you the American military is ready to meet any threat we may face in the world today. The fact is, judging by its results from Desert Storm to the Balkans, Bosnia and Kosovo, to the operations that are still being conducted to keep Saddam Hussein in a box in Iraq, the American military has performed brilliantly. This administration has turned around the drop in spending that began in the mid-80s and right through the Bush-Cheney administration and the early years of the Clinton administration, but now thats stopped. We passed the largest pay increase in a generation for our military. And the interesting fact here, in spite of the rhetoric that my opponent has just spoken, the reality is if you look at our projected budgets for the next ten years, Al Gore and I actually commit twice as much, $100 billion in additional funding for our military than Governor Bush does. And their budget allows nothing additional for acquisition of new weapons systems. Thats something the same Gen. Mike Ryan of the airforce and all the other chiefs of the services will not be happy about because they need the new equipment, the new systems that Al Gore and I are committed to giving them.",2000-10-05,Democrat
Cheney,"Bernie, this is a special interest of mine. I would like a chance to elaborate further, if I might. The facts are dramatically different. Im not attacking the military, Joe. I have enormous regard for the men and women of the U.S. military. I had the privilege of working with them for the four years I was the Secretary of Defense. No one has a higher regard than I do for them. Its irresponsible to suggest we shouldnt have this debate, that we should ignore what is a major, major concern. If you have friends and relatives serving in the U.S. military, you know theres a problem. If you look at the data thats available, 40% of our Army helicopters are not combat ready. The combat readiness level in the Air Force dropped from 85% to 65%. Significant problems of retention. The important thing for us to remember is that were a democracy and were defended by volunteers. Everybody out there tonight wearing the uniform, standing on guard to protect the United States is there because they volunteered to put on a uniform. When we dont give them the spare parts they need, when we dont give our pilots the flying hours they need to maintain their proficiency, when we dont give them the kind of leadership that spells out what their mission is and lets them know why theyre putting their lives at risk, then we undermine that morale. Thats an extraordinarily valuable trust. There is no more important responsibility for a President of the United States than his role as Commander in Chief, and the obligation he undertakes on behalf o fall of us when he decides when to send our young men and women to war. When we send them without the right kind of training, when we send them poorly equipped or with equipment thats old and broken down, we put their lives at risk. We will suffer more casualties in the next conflict if we dont look to those basic fundamental problems now. With all due respect this administration has a bad track record in this regard, and its available for anybody who wants to look at the record and wants to talk to our men and women in uniform, and wants to spend time with the members of the Joint Chiefs, wants to look at readiness levels and other  other indicators. Final point, the issue of procurement is very important because were running now off the buildup of the investment we made during the Reagan years. As that equipment gets old, it has to be replaced. Weve taken money out of the procurement budget to support other ventures. We have not been investing in the future of the U.S. military.",2000-10-05,Republican
Lieberman,"Its important to respond to this. Yes, of course its an important debate to have as part of this campaign, but I dont want either the military to feel uneasy or the American people to feel insecure. What Im saying now Im basing on serving on the Senate Armed Services Committee talking to exactly the people Dick Cheney has mentioned, the Secretary of Defense, the Chiefs of Staff. Ive visited our fighting forces around the world. Im telling you that we are ready to meet any contingency that might arise. The good news here and the interesting news is that we have met our recruitment targets in each of the services this year. In fact, in the areas where our opponents have said we are overextended, such as the Balkans, the soldiers there have a higher rate of re-enlistment than anywhere else in the service because they feel a sense of purpose, a sense of mission. In fact, this administration has begun to transform the American military to take it away from being a Cold War force to prepare it to meet the threats of the new generation of tomorrow, of weapons of mass destruction, of ballistic missiles, terrorism, cyber warfare. The fact is that Governor Bush recommended in his major policy statement on the military earlier this year that we skip the next generation of military equipment; helicopters, submarines, tactical air fighters, all the rest. That would really cripple our readiness. Exactly the readiness that Dick Cheney is talking about. Al Gore and I are committed to continuing this acquisition program, transforming the military. Theres still fewer people in uniform today, but person-to-person, person-by-person, unit-by-unit, this is the most powerful and effective military, not only in the world today, but in the history of the world. And again, Al Gore and I will do whatever is necessary to keep it that way.",2000-10-05,Democrat
Moderator,"Senator Lieberman, this question to you. Once again in the Middle East, peace talks on the one hand, deadly confrontations on the other, and the flashpoint, Jerusalem, and then theres Syria. Is United States policy what it should be?",2000-10-05,Moderator
Lieberman,"Yes, it is. It has truly pained me in the last week to watch the unrest and the death occurring in the Middle East between the Israelis and the Palestinians. So much work has been done by the people there with the support of this administration. So much progress has been made in the original Oslo agreements between the Israelis, the Palestinians, adopted in 1993, and the peace between Israel and Jordan thereafter. I mean America has a national strategic interest and principled interest in peace in the Middle East, and Al Gore has played a critical role in advancing that process over the last eight years. What pains me is I watched the unrest in recent days between the Israelis and the Palestinians. That these two peoples have come in some senses, generations forward, centuries forward, in the last seven years. They are so close to a final peace agreement, I hope and pray that the death and unrest in the last week will not create the kinds of scars that make it hard for them to go back to the peace table with American assistance and achieve what Im convinced the great majority of the Israeli and Palestinian people want, and indeed these people throughout the Middle East, which is peace. Secretary Albright has been in Paris meeting with prime minister Barak and chairman Arafat. I hope and pray her mission is successful, that there is a cease fire, and the parties return to the peace table. Weve been on a very constructive course in the Middle East, played an unusual, unique role. And Im convinced that Al Gore and I will continue to do that. I hope I might, through my friendships in Israel and throughout the Arab world, play a unique role in bringing peace to this  this sacred region of the world.",2000-10-05,Democrat
Cheney,"Bernie, it has been a very, very difficult area to work in for a long time. Numerous administrations going back certainly to World War II have had to wrestle with the problem of what should happen to the Middle East. We made significant breakthroughs, I think, at the end of the Bush administration because of the Gulf War. In effect, we had joined together with Arab allies and done enormous damage to the Iraqi armed forces. Iraq was the biggest military threat to Israel. By virtue of the end of the Cold War, the Soviets were no longer a factor. They used to fish in troubled waters whenever they had the opportunity in the Middle East. With the end of the Soviet Union, the implosion of the empire, that created a vacuum if you will, and made it easier for us to operate there. We were able to, I think, reassure both Arabs and Israelis would play a major role there. We have the ability and the will to deploy forces if we had to, to engage in military operations to help our friends and oppose our foes. We were able to convene them in a conference. The first time Arab and Israelis sat down face-to-face and began this process of trying to move the peace process forward. I think also a lot of credit goes to some great men like Yitzak Rabin. His tragic passing was of great consequence, a great tragedy for everybody who cares about peace in the Middle East. He was a man who had the military stature to be able to confidently persuade the Israelis to take risks for peace. I think Barak has tried to same thing. I hope that we can get this resolved as soon as possible. My guess is the next administration is going to be the one that is going to have to come to grips with the current state of affairs there. I think its very important that we have an administration where we have a president with firm leadership who has the kind of track record of dealing straight with people, of keeping his word so friends and allies both respect us and our adversaries fear us.",2000-10-05,Republican
Moderator,"This question is for you, Mr. Secretary. If Iraqs president Saddam Hussein were found to be developing weapons of mass destruction, Governor Bush has said he would, quote, Take him out. Would you agree with such a deadly policy?",2000-10-05,Moderator
Cheney,"We might have no other choice. Well have to see if that happens. The thing about Iraq, of course, was at the end of the war we had pretty well decimated their military. We had put them back in the box, so to speak. We had a strong international coalition raid against them, effective economic sanctions, and a very robust inspection regime was in place under the U.N. auspices and it was able to do a good job of stripping out the capacity to build weapons of mass destruction, the work he had been doing that had not been destroyed during the war in biological and chemical agents, as well as a nuclear program. Unfortunately now we find ourselves in a situation where that started to fray on us, where the coalition now no longer is tied tightly together. Recently the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain, two Gulf States, have reopened diplomatic relations with Baghdad. The Russians and French are flying commercial airliners back into Baghdad and thumbing their nose at the international sanctions regime, and of course U.N. inspectors have been kicked out and theres been absolutely no response. . Were in a situation today where our posture with Iraq is weaker than it was at the end of the war. Its unfortunate. I also think its unfortunate we find ourselves in a position where we dont know for sure what might be transpiring inside Iraq. I certainly hope hes not regenerating that kind of capability, but if he were, if in fact Saddam Hussein were taking steps to try to rebuild nuclear capability or weapons of mass destruction, you would have to give very serious consideration to military action to  to stop that activity. I dont think you can afford to have a man like Saddam Hussein with nuclear weapons in the Middle East.",2000-10-05,Republican
Moderator,Senator.,2000-10-05,Moderator
Lieberman,"It would, of course, be a very serious situation if we had evidence, credible evidence, that Saddam Hussein was developing weapons of mass destruction. I must say, I dont think a political campaign is the occasion to declare exactly what we would do in that case. I think thats a matter of such critical national security importance that it ought to be left to the Commander in Chief, leaders of the military, Secretary of State to make that kind of decision without the heat of a political campaign. The fact is that we will not enjoy real stability in the Middle East until Saddam Hussein is gone. The Gulf War was a great victory. And incidentally, Al Gore and I were two of the ten Democrats in the Senate who crossed party lines to support President Bush and Secretary Cheney in that war. Were both very proud we did that. But, the war did not end with a total victory. Saddam Hussein remained there. As a result, we have had almost ten years now of instability. We have continued to operate almost all of this time military action to enforce a no-fly zone. We have been struggling with Saddam about the inspectors. We ought to do, and were doing everything we can to get the inspectors back in there. But in the end theres not going to be peace until he goes. And thats why I was proud to co-sponsor the Iraq Liberation Act with Senator Trent Lott why I have kept in touch with the indigenous Iraqi opposition, broad based, to Saddam Hussein. The Vice President met with them earlier this year. We are supporting them in their efforts and will continue to support them until the Iraqi people rise up and do what the people of Serbia have done in the last few days, get rid of a despot. Well welcome you back into the family of nations where you belong.",2000-10-05,Democrat
Moderator,"Senator Lieberman, this question is for you. Many experts are forecasting continuing chaotic oil prices in the world market. Wholesale natural gas prices here in our country are leaping. Then there are coal and electricity. Have previous Republican and Democratic Congresses and administrations, including this one, done their job to protect the American people?",2000-10-05,Moderator
Lieberman,"Not enough, but this administration and Vice President Gore and I have had both a long-term strategy to develop energy independence and a short-term strategy. In fact, if the  this administration had been given the amount of funding that it had requested from the Republican Congress, we would be further along in the implementation of that long-term strategy aimed at developing cleaner sources of energy, giving tax credits to individuals and businesses to conserve and use energy more efficiently. Aimed at a partnership for a new generation of vehicles with the American automobile industry which is making great progress and can produce a vehicle that can get 80 miles per gallon. We also have a short-term strategy. To deal with exactly the kind of ups and downs of energy prices. I know it was controversial, but Al Gore and I believed it was important in the short-term to reach into the strategic petroleum reserve, take some of the oil we have, put it in the market, show the big oil companies and the OPEC oil-producing countries that weve got some resources with which we can fight back. We arent going to lay back and let them roll over our economy. We did it also because gasoline prices were rising and home heating oil inventories were real low. Both of our tickets agree on LIHEAP keeping the low income housing assistance program, but our opponents offer no assistance to middle-class families hit by rising gas prices and a shortage of home heating oil. The fact is that since the reserve was opened the price of oil on world markets has dropped $6 a barrel. Thats a good result and Im proud of it.",2000-10-05,Democrat
Moderator,Mr. Secretary.,2000-10-05,Moderator
Cheney,"This is an area, again, where I think again Joe and I have fairly significant disagreements. My assessment is that there is no comprehensive energy policy today. That as a nation, we are in trouble because the administration has not addressed these issues. We have the prospects of brownouts in California. We have a potential home heating oil crisis in the northeast. We have gasoline price rises in various other places. For years now the administration has talked about reducing our dependence on foreign sources of oil, but they havent done it. In fact, weve gone exactly in the opposite direction. We have the lowest rate of domestic production of oil now in 46 years. You have to go back to 1954 to find a time when we produced as little oil as we do today. Our imports are at an all-time record high. In June we imported almost 12 million barrels of oil a day. That means we are more subject to the wide fluctuations and swings in price. We have other problems. We dont have refinery capacity. We havent built a new refinery in this country for over ten years. Theyre operating at 96% or 97% capacity. Even with more crude available theyre probably not going to be able to do very much by way of producing additional home heating oil for this winter. We have a growing problem with our growing dependence on foreign sources of energy. That will allways be the case but we ought to be able to shift the trend and begin to move it in the right direction. We need to do a lot more about generating the capacity for power here at home. We need to get on with the business and we think we can do it very safely in an environmentally sound manner. We dont think we ought to buy into this false choice that somehow we cannot develop energy resources without being cautious with the environment. We can. We have the technology to do it and we ought to do it. We do support the low income energy assistance program. We think its important that senior citizens dont suffer this winter, but we need to get on to the business of having a plan to develop our domestic energy resources in producing more supplies, and this administration hasnt produced them.",2000-10-05,Republican

Moderator,"Thank you, sir. Your congressional record, you sponsored a bill that said no to oil and gas exploration in the Wyoming wilderness areas of your home state. However, you co-sponsored a bill that said yes to drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Your explanation?",2000-10-05,Moderator
Cheney,It shows I have a balanced approach to how we deal with environmental issues.,2000-10-05,Republican
Moderator,Not a case of not in my backyard?,2000-10-05,Moderator
Cheney,"No. I think we have to make choices. The Wyoming wilderness bill, frankly was one of my proudest achievements as a member of Congress. I worked on that with my good friend Al Simpson for about four years. We set aside a part of Wyoming, nearly a million acres of wilderness that ought to be separate and not be developed. We think that was important. There are a lot of areas around the country where Governor Bush and I support restraint. For example we support the moratorium on drilling off the coast of California, but there are places where we think we ought to go forward and develop those resources. The Arctic National Wildlife Reserve is one of them. Its on the north slope right next to Prudhoe Bay. The infrastructure is there to be able to deliver that product to market. We think we can do it given todays technology in a way that will not damage the environment, will not permanently marr the countryside at all, and so what were looking for with respect to environmental policy and energy policy is balance. We do have to make choices, we recognize that. The way you phrased the question, frankly I welcome because it shows, in fact, we are trying to pursue a balanced approach and the suggestion that somehow all we care about is energy development isnt true. But we do have to get on with developing those resources or were going to find ourselves ever more dependent on foreign sources. Were going to find that the fact that we dont have an energy policy out there is one of the major storm clouds on the horizon for our economy. I think if you look for something that could develop, some problem that could arise, that might, in fact, jeopardize our continuing prosperity, its the possibility that we might find ourselves without adequate supplies of energy in the future. And there would be no quicker way to shut down our economy than that.",2000-10-05,Republican
Lieberman,"Bernie, we agree on the problem but we couldnt disagree more on the response to the problem. The problem is accurately stated. No matter how strong we are economically, if we remain dependent on a source of energy that is outside our control, were not going to be as strong as we should be. Others around the world can effectively yank our chain, and we cannot allow that to continue to happen. Im afraid that our opponents response to this is one-sided, and it is essentially to develop the resources within the United States almost regardless of where. Im against drilling in the Arctic Refuge. This is one of the most beautiful, pristine places that the good Lord has created on earth. It happens to be within the United States of America. Its not worth it to do that for what seems to be the possibility of six months worth of oil, seven to 12 years from now. Thats not much of a response to the immediate problem that gasoline consumers and home heating oil customers are facing this winter. There are more resources within the United States that we can develop. This isnt mentioned much and appreciated much. In the last eight years drilling for gas on federal lands has gone up 60% and its been done in an environmentally protected way. The administration has encouraged the drilling for deep gas and oil going on in the western Gulf today. The answer here is new technology that will create millions of new jobs. Let me just say this. If we can get three miles more per gallon from our cars well get a  well save 1 million barrels of oil a day, which is exactly what the refuge at its best in Alaska would produce. The choice to me is clear. We have to develop fuel cells, alternative energy, encourage people to conserve and to be efficient.",2000-10-05,Democrat
Moderator,"This question is for you, Senator. We all know Social Security is the backbone of the retirement system in our nation. Can either of you pledge tonight categorically that no one will lose benefits under your plans?",2000-10-05,Moderator
Lieberman,"Yes, indeed. I can pledge to the American people categorically that no one will lose benefits under our plan for Social Security as far forward as 2054. And let me come back and say, Bernie, that Al Gore and I view Social Security as probably the best thing the government did in the second half  the last century. It has created a floor under which seniors cannot fall, and so many of them depend on it for their basic living, for their livelihood. Its critically important to protect it. Thats why Al and I have committed to putting that Social Security surplus in a lockbox, not touching it. Thats what allows us to keep Social Security solvent to 2054. Our opponents have an idea for privatizing Social Security that will jeopardize Social Security payments to recipients. And I looked at this idea. If I may use an oil industry analogy, which is to say that sometimes as you know, Dick, better than I, you have to drill deep to find out whether theres oil in a well. For a while I was drilling into this idea of privatization of Social Security. The deeper I got the drier the well became and it seemed to me at the end it was going to dry up Social Security. It requires taking as much as a trillion dollars out of the Social Security fund. The independent analysts have said that would put the fund out of money in 2023, or if its not out of money, benefits will have to be cut by over 50%. Thats just not worth doing. Al Gore and I are going to guarantee Social Security and add to it the retirement savings plan that I mentioned earlier which will help middle-class families looking forward. They will have not only Social Security, but a superb extra retirement account as well. Social Security plus with us. With all due respect, Social Security minus from the Bush-Cheney ticket.",2000-10-05,Democrat
Cheney,"You wont be surprised if I disagree with Joes description. The Social Security system is in trouble. Its been a fantastic program and has been there for 65 years that has provided benefits for senior citizens over that period of time. For my parents. It means a great deal to millions of Americans. And Governor Bush and I want to make absolutely certain that the first thing we do is guarantee the continuation of those payments, those benefits and keep those promises that were made. But if you look down the road, you say youre 30 years old today, and I have two daughters about that age. They seriously question whether or not there will be any system left for them. Thats because the demographics that work out there, its almost an iron law. They know how many people there are, when they reach retirement, we know when the baby boom generation is coming along, how long they will live after that, it will drive the system into bankruptcy unless we reform and deal with it. The reform we would like to offer is to allow our young people to begin to take a portion of the payroll tax, 2% of it, and invest it in a personal retirement account. That does several things. First of all, it gives them a stake in the Social Security system. That becomes their property. They own it. They can pass it on to their kids if they want. They dont have that kind of equity in Social Security today. Secondly, we can generate a higher return off that investment than you get in the existing system. Today you get about a 2% return of what you pay into Social Security. We think we can generate at least 6%. At least three times what were able to get now. And long-term by generating a bigger return, well put additional funds into the system that will help us survive that crunch that is otherwise going to hit in the future. Bottom line is theres a choice here. With respect to Al Gore and Joes plan, they dont reform Social Security. They add another huge obligation on top of it that future generations will have to pay. They dont touch the basic system itself. They dont reform it and dont save it. We have a plan to do that and a plan to give our young people a choice and more control over their own lives.",2000-10-05,Republican
Moderator,"Mr. Secretary, this question is for you. Washington is a caldron of political bickering and partisanship. The American people, gentleman, have had enough. How would you elevate political discourse and purpose?",2000-10-05,Moderator
Cheney,"Well, I think there are a number of ways to do it. First of all, I agree with your assessment. Ive been out of Washington for the last eight years and spent the last five years running a company global concern. And been out in the private sector building a business, hiring people, creating jobs. I have a different perspective on Washington than I had when I was there in the past. Im proud of my service for 25 years, but also proud I had the opportunity to go out and get a different experience. And youre absolutely right. People are fed up. Theyve had enough with the bickering and the partisanship that seems to characterize the debate that goes on in the nations capital. Ive seen it done differently though. Ive seen it in Texas. Ive watched George Bush. And one of the reasons I was eager to sign on when he asked me to become his running mate is because Ive been so tremendously impressed with what hes done as the Governor of Texas. He came in when he had a legislature completely controlled by the other party. He managed to reach across partisan lines and unite republicans, and democrats and independents and put them to work to achieve good things for the State of Texas. Partly because he didnt point the finger of blame looking for scapegoats he was quick to share the credit. He ended up, as a result of that activity of his first term, having the top Democrat in the state, Bob Bulloch, endorse George Bush for reelection. Its possible to change the tone. It is possible to get people to work together and to begin to focus on achieving results. I think it will take new leadership. I dont think you can do it, with all due respect to Al Gore, with somebody who spent all the last 24 years in that Washington environment and who campaigns on the basis of castigating others, pointing the finger of blame at others in terms of blaming business or various groups for failings. I think you have to be able to reach out and work together and build coalitions. I think George W. Bush has done it in Texas and can do it at the national level.",2000-10-05,Republican
Lieberman,"Youre absolutely right. Theres too much partisanship in Washington. It puzzles me. You think people in public life and politics would want to do what would make them popular, and too often people in both parties act in a way that brings down the institutions of government, and each of us individually, and its a shame. I have tried very hard in my career to call them as I see them and work with colleagues on both sides of the aisle to get things done. Im proud of my record in that regard, and I certainly think that would be an asset that I could bring to the vice presidency should I be fortunate enough to be elected. In my senate career Ive worked with Bob Dole on Bosnia. I worked with John McCain on cultural values. I worked with Connie Mack on foreign policy. Don Nichols on the International Religious Freedom Act. If I go on much longer Ill get in trouble with my own party. Thats the way things get done. Im proud of those partnerships. Let me say a word about Al Gore. In his years in the house and Senate, he formed similar bipartisan partnerships. If you look back over the last eight years, the most significant accomplishments of this administration in which Al Gore was centrally involved were the result, most of them, of bipartisan agreements. After all, the Welfare Reform Act, which Al Gore promised to lead the effort on to get people off of welfare to set time limits, to get people to enjoy the dignity of work. That was a bipartisan act that was adopted. The Anti-Crime Act that has helped to lower crime more than 20% in our country was also bipartisan. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 which was critical to getting our economy to the point and our government to the point of unprecedented surplus we enjoy today also was bipartisan, and Al Gore was involved. I would say thats exactly the kind of bipartisan leadership that he and I can bring to Washington to get things done.",2000-10-05,Democrat
Cheney,"With all due respect, Joe, theres an awful lot of evidence that there hasnt been any bipartisan leadership out of this administration or Al Gore. The fact is the Medicare problems have not been addressed. We have had eight years of problems with prescription drugs not being addressed. Social Security problems not been addressed. The educational problem has not been addressed. Weve had eight years of talk but no action. Theyve been in a position of responsibility in the White House. The powerful interests, if you will, in Washington, D.C. and been unable to work with others. Medicare is a good example. The Breaux Commission, a good effort at a bipartisan solution for Medicare whether you bought or didnt buy the answer that was generated, the fact is the administration set it up and pulled the plug on it because they would rather have an issue, not a solution. They havent lead from a bipartisan standpoint and I think Al Gores record isnt very good.",2000-10-05,Republican
Lieberman,"Dick Cheney must be one of the few people who think nothing has been accomplished in the last eight years. Promises were made and promises were kept. Has Al Gore  did Al Gore make promises in 1992? Absolutely. Did he deliver? Big time. If I may put it that way. Thats the record. Look at the 20  look at the 22 million new jobs. Look at the 4 million new businesses. Look at the lower interest rates, low rate of inflation, high rate of growth. I think if you asked most people in America today that famous question that Ronald Reagan asked, Are you better off today than you were eight years ago? Most people would say yes. Im pleased to see, Dick, from the newspapers that youre better off than you were eight years ago, too.",2000-10-05,Democrat

Moderator,"Dick Cheney, Joe Lieberman, you are black for this question. Imagine yourself an African-American. You become the target of racial profiling either while walking or driving. African-American Joseph Lieberman, what would you do about it?",2000-10-05,Moderator
Lieberman,"I would be outraged. It is such an assault on the basic promise that America makes that the law will treat individuals as individuals regardless of their status. That is to say their race, their nationality, their gender, sexual orientation, etcetera, etcetera. And the sad fact is that racial profiling occurs in this country. I have a few African-American friends who have gone through this horror and, you know, it makes me want to kind of hit the wall because its such an assault on their humanity and their citizenship. We cant tolerate it anymore. Thats why Ive supported legislation in the first instance in Congress. Because its the most we could get done to do hard studies to make the case of the extent to which racial profiling is occurring in our country. But its also why Im so proud that Al Gore said two things. First we would issue, if were fortunate enough to be elected, an executive order prohibiting racial profiling. And secondly the first Civil Rights Act legislation we would send to Congress would be a national ban on racial profiling. It is just wrong. It is unAmerican, and to think that in the 21st Century this kind of nonsense is still going on. We have to stop it. The only way to stop it is through the law. The law, after all, is meant to express our values and our aspirations for our society. And our values are violently contradicted by the kind of racial profiling that I know exists. I had a friend a while ago who works in the government, works at the White House, African-American, stopped, surrounded by police for no other cause that anyone can determine than the color of his skin. That cant be in America anymore.",2000-10-05,Democrat
Moderator,Mr. Secretary.,2000-10-05,Moderator
Cheney,"Bernie, I would like to answer your question to the best of my ability, but I dont think I can understand fully what it would be like. I try hard to put myself in that position and imagine what it would be like, but Ive always been part of the majority, never part of a minority group. It has to be a horrible experience. The sense of anger and frustration and rage that go with knowing that the only reason you were stopped, the only reason you were arrested, was because of the color of your skin would make me extraordinarily angry, and Im not sure how I would respond. I think that we have to recognize that while weve made enormous progress in the U.S. in racial relations and come a great long way, we still have a very long way to go. We still have not only the problems were talking about here tonight in terms of the problems you mentioned in profiling, but beyond that, we still have an achievement gap in education, income differentials, differences in life span. We still have, I think, a society that  where we havent done enough yet to live up to that standard that wed all like to live up to. I think in terms of equality of opportunity, that we judge people as individuals. As Martin Luther King said, we ought to judge people on the content of their character instead of the color of their skin. I would hope we can continue to make progress int that regard in the years ahead.",2000-10-05,Republican
Moderator,"Senator, sexual orientation. Should a male who loves a male and a female who loves a female have all  all the constitutional rights enjoyed by every American citizen?",2000-10-05,Moderator
Lieberman,"Very current and difficult question. Ive been thinking about it. I want to explain what my thoughts have been. Maybe I should begin this answer by going back to the beginning of the country and the Declaration of Independence which says there at the outset that all of us are created equal and that were endowed not by any bunch of politicians or philosophers, but by our Creator, with those inalienable rights of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. At the beginning of our history, that promise that ideal was not realized or experienced by all Americans, but over time since then we have extended the orbit of that promise. In our time at the frontier of that effort is extending those kinds of rights to gay and lesbian Americans who are citizens of this country and children of the same awesome God just as much as any of the rest of us are. Thats why I have been an original co-sponsor of the Employment Non-Discrimination Act which aims to prevent gay and lesbian Americans who are otherwise qualified from being discriminated against in the workplace. And Ive sponsored other pieces of legislation and taken other actions that carry out that ideal. The question you pose is a difficult one for this reason. It confronts or challenges the traditional notion of marriage as being limited to a heterosexual couple, which I support. I must say Im thinking about this, because I have friends who are in gay and lesbian partnerships who said to me, isnt it fair. We dont have legal rights to inheritance, visitation when one partner is ill, to health care benefits. Thats why Im thinking about it. My mind is open to taking some action that will address those elements of unfairness while respecting the traditional religious and civil institution of marriage.",2000-10-05,Democrat
Moderator,Mr. Secretary.,2000-10-05,Moderator
Cheney,"This is a tough one, Bernie. The fact of the matter is we live in a free society, and freedom means freedom for everybody. We dont get to choose, and we shouldnt be able to choose and say you get to live free and you dont. That means people should be free to enter into any kind of relationship they want to enter into. Its no ones business in terms of regulating behavior in that regard. The next step then, of course, is the question you ask of whether or not there ought to be some kind of official sanction of the relationships or if these relationships should be treated the same as a traditional marriage. Thats a tougher problem. Thats not a slam dunk. The fact of the matter is that it is regulated by the states. I think different states are likely to come to different conclusions, and thats appropriate. I dont think there should necessarily be a federal policy in this area. I try to be open minded about it as much as I can and tolerant of those relationships. And like Joe, Im also wrestling with the extent to which there ought to be legal sanction of those relationships. I think we ought to do everything we can to tolerate and accommodate whatever kind of relationships people want to enter into.",2000-10-05,Republican
Moderator,"It occurs to me your moderator has committed a boo-boo. I asked the racial profiling question of you and you responded and then I asked the sexual orientation question of you. I should not have done that in terms of rotation. Gentlemen, I apologize.",2000-10-05,Moderator

Cheney,"We clearly come from different political perspectives. Joe is a Democrat from New England, Im a Republican from the west, from Wyoming. And I think that weighs into it to some extent. Clearly were both in the positions were in because of our personal relationships with our principals. I think the areas that I would bring are the things that Governor Bush emphasized when he picked me. That I have been White House Chief of Staff and ran the White House under President Ford. Spent ten years in the House, eight of that in the leadership. Served as Secretary of Defense, and then had significant experience in the private sector. I think that where there are differences between Joe and myself in terms of background and experience, I clearly have spent a lot of time in executive positions running large organizations both in private business as well as in government. And that is a set of qualifications that Governor Bush found attractive when he selected me. Ill leave it at that.",2000-10-05,Republican
Moderator,Senator?,2000-10-05,Moderator
Lieberman,"I have great respect for Dick Cheney. I dont agree with a lot of things he said in this campaign. But I have a lot of respect for him. He was a very distinguished Secretary of Defense, and I dont have anything negative to say about him. I want to say with the humility that is required to respond to this statement that I think what I would bring to the office of the vice presidency is a lifetimes experience. Growing up in a working class family, having the opportunity to go to a great public school system, then to go on to college and then to be drawn really by President Kennedy, as well as the values of service my family gave me, into public life. Wanting to make a difference. I have had extraordinary opportunities, thanks again to those folks back home in Connecticut,  as a state senator, attorney general trying to enforce the law to protect them and the environment and consumers, and to litigate on behalf of humans rights. And for the last 12 years as a member of the Senate of the United States focusing on national security questions, environmental protection, economic growth and values. But perhaps what I most bring is a friendship and shared values and shared priorities with Al Gore. I have tremendous respect for Al Gore. Ive known him for 15 years. Hes an outstanding person as a public official and as a private person. His life is built on his faith. Its devoted to his family. He volunteered for service in Vietnam from the beginning. In Congress hes been willing to take on the big interests and fight for average people. As vice president I think hes been the most effective vice president in the history of the United States and he has the right program to use the prosperity all the American people have earned to help particularly hard working middle-class families raise up their children to enjoy a better life. I think thats what this is all about, why Im so proud to be his running mate.",2000-10-05,Democrat

Lieberman,"Thanks, Bernie.",2000-10-05,Democrat
Cheney,"I do have a couple of concerns where I like the old Joe Lieberman better than I do the new Joe Lieberman. Lets see if I can put them in those terms. Joe established an outstanding record, I thought, in his work on this whole question of violence in the media. And the kinds of materials that were being peddled to our children. And many of us on the Republican side admired him for that. There is, I must say, the view now that having joined with Al Gore on the ticket on the other side, that the depth of conviction that we had admired before isnt quite as strong as it was, perhaps, in the past. The temptation on the one hand to criticize the activities of the industry, as was pointed out recently in the Federal Trade Commission where theyre taking clearly material meant for adults and selling it to our children, while at the same time they are participating in fundraising events with some of the people responsible for that activity has been a source of concern for many of us. We were especially disturbed, Joe, at a recent fundraiser you attended where there was a comedian that got up and criticized George Bushs religion. I know youre not responsible for having uttered any words of criticism of his religion. My concern would be, frankly, that you havent been as  as consistent as you had been in the past. That a lot of your good friends like Bill Bennett and others of us who had admired your firmness of purpose over the years have felt that youre not quite the crusader for that cause that you once were.",2000-10-05,Republican
Lieberman,"Bernie, youll not be surprised to hear that I disagree. First let me talk about that joke about religion which I found very distasteful. And believe me, if anybody has devoted his life to respecting the role of religion in American life and understands that Americans from the beginning of our history have turned to God for strength and purpose, its me. And any offense that was done, I apologize for. I thought that humor was unacceptable. Let me come to the question of Hollywood and then answer the general question. Al Gore and I have felt for a long time, first as parents and then only second as public officials, that we cannot let Americas parents stand alone in this competition that they feel theyre in with Hollywood to raise their own kids and give their kids the faith and values they want to give them. Ive been a consistent crusader on that behalf. John McCain and I actually requested the Federal Trade Commission report that came out three or four weeks ago which proved conclusively that the entertainment industry was marketing adult-rated products to our children. That is just not acceptable. One finding was that they were actually using 10 to 12-year-olds to test screen adult-rated products. When that report came out, Al Gore and I said to the entertainment industry, stop it. If you dont stop it in six months, well ask the Federal Trade Commission to take action against you. There was no similar strong response from our opponents. We repeated that message when we went to Los Angeles. I repeat it today. We wont stop until the entertainment industry stops marketing its products to our children. Al Gore and I  Im out. Maybe I can come back to it.",2000-10-05,Democrat

Moderator,"Gentlemen, now closing statements. A prior coin toss has determined that you begin, Senator Lieberman.",2000-10-05,Moderator
Lieberman,"That went very quickly. Thank you, Bernie, and thanks, Dick Cheney, for a very good debate. Im told tens of millions of people have been watching this debate tonight. I must say, I wish one more person were here to watch and that is my dad, who died 15 years ago. If my dad were here, I would have the opportunity to tell him that he was right when he taught me that in America, if you have faith, work hard and play by the rules, there is nothing you cannot achieve. And here I am even the son of a man who started working the night shift on a bakery truck can end up being a candidate for Vice President of the United States. That says a lot about the character of this nation and the goodness of you, the American people. I will tell you that Hadassah and I have traveled around this country in the last couple of months and met thousands and thousands of parents just like our moms and dads, hard working middle-class people paying their taxes, doing the jobs to keep the country running. Trying so hard to teach their kids right from wrong and believing in their hearts that their kids can make it. I agree with them. But to make it they need a leader who will stand up and fight for them for good education, the best education in the world. For a sound retirement system, for prescription drug benefits for their parents. And for a government that is fiscally responsible, balances the budget. Keeps interest rates down so they can afford to buy a home or send their kids to college. To me Al Gore is that leader and will be that kind of president. You know, for 224 years Americans have dreamed bigger dreams and tried bolder solutions than any other people on earth. Now is not the time to settle for less than we can be. As good as things are today, Al Gore and I believe that with your help and Gods help we can make the future of this good and blessed country even better.

Cheney,"Bernie, I want to thank you and Joe as well. Ive enjoyed the debate this evening. And thank the folks here at the Centre College in Danville, Kentucky, theyve done a tremendous job of making this possible. This is a very important decision youre going to make on November 7. We have a fundamental choice between whether or not we continue with our old ways of big government, high taxes and ever more intrusive bureaucracy, or whether we take a new course for a new era. Governor Bush and I want to pursue the new course. We want to reform the Social Security system to guarantee benefits will be there for our retired folks, as well as make it possible for our young people to invest a portion of their payroll tax into a retirement account that theyll control and give them greater control over their own lives. We want to reform the Medicare system to make certain the benefits are there for our senior citizens, but also to provide prescription drug coverage for them and give them a range of choices in terms of the kind of insurance we have. We want to reform the education system. We want to restore our public schools to the greatness they once represented so that every parent has the opportunity to choose what is best for their child and so that every child has an opportunity to share in the American dream. We also want to reform the tax code. We think its very important now that we have a surplus, that a portion of that surplus go back to the people who earned it. Its not the governments money, its your money. Youre entitled to it, and we would like to see to it that we provide tax relief for everybody who pays taxes. Finally, we think its very important to rebuild the U.S. military. The military is in trouble. The trends are in the wrong direction. The finest men and women in uniform that youll find anyplace in the world but they deserve our support. They deserve the resources that we need to provide for them and they deserve good leadership. George Bush is the man to do this. Ive seen him do it in Texas. What we need is to be able to reach across the aisle. Put together coalitions of Republicans and Democrats and build the kinds of coalitions that will get something done, finally, in Washington. George Bush is good man, an honorable man, a man of great integrity. He will make a first rate president.",2000-10-05,Republican

Welcome to the first and the only 2008 vice presidential debate between the Republican nominee, Governor Sarah Palin of Alaska, and the Democratic nominee, Joe Biden of Delaware. The Commission on Presidential Debates is the sponsor of this event and the two remaining presidential debates. Tonights discussion will cover a wide range of topics, including domestic and foreign policy matters. It will be divided roughly into five-minute segments. Each candidate will have 90 seconds to respond to a direct question and then an additional two minutes for rebuttal and follow-up. The order has been determined by a coin toss. The specific subjects and questions were chosen by me and have not been shared or cleared with anyone on the campaigns or on the commission.

The House of Representatives this week passed a bill, a big bailout bill  or didnt pass it, I should say. The Senate decided to pass it, and the House is wrestling with it still tonight.",2008-10-02,Moderator
Biden,"Let me begin by thanking you, Gwen, for hosting this. And, Governor, its a pleasure to meet you, and its a pleasure to be with you. I think its neither the best or worst of Washington, but its evidence of the fact that the economic policies of the last eight years have been the worst economic policies weve ever had. As a consequence, youve seen whats happened on Wall Street. If you need any more proof positive of how bad the economic theories have been, this excessive deregulation, the failure to oversee what was going on, letting Wall Street run wild, I dont think you needed any more evidence than what you see now. So the Congress has been put  Democrats and Republicans have been put in a very difficult spot. But Barack Obama laid out four basic criteria for any kind of rescue plan here. He, first of all, said there has to be oversight. Were not going to write any check to anybody unless theres oversight for the  of the secretary of Treasury. He secondly said you have to focus on homeowners and folks on Main Street. Thirdly, he said that you have to treat the taxpayers like investors in this case. And, lastly, what you have to do is make sure that CEOs dont benefit from this, because this could end up, in the long run, people making money off of this rescue plan. And so, as a consequence of that, it brings us back to maybe the fundamental disagreement between Governor Palin and me and Senator McCain and Barack Obama, and that is that the  were going to fundamentally change the focus of the economic policy. Were going to focus on the middle class, because its  when the middle class is growing, the economy grows and everybody does well, not just focus on the wealthy and corporate America.",2008-10-02,Democrat
Ifill,"Thank you, Senator.",2008-10-02,Moderator
Palin,"Thank you, Gwen. And I thank the commission, also. I appreciate this privilege of being able to be here and speak with Americans. Fear about, how are we going to afford to send our kids to college? A fear, as small-business owners, perhaps, how were going to borrow any money to increase inventory or hire more people. The barometer there, I think, is going to be resounding that our economy is hurting and the federal government has not provided the sound oversight that we need and that we deserve, and we need reform to that end. Now, John McCain thankfully has been one representing reform. Two years ago, remember, it was John McCain who pushed so hard with the Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac reform measures. He sounded that warning bell. People in the Senate with him, his colleagues, didnt want to listen to him and wouldnt go towards that reform that was needed then. I think that the alarm has been heard, though, and there will be that greater oversight, again thanks to John McCains bipartisan efforts that he was so instrumental in bringing folks together over this past week, even suspending his own campaign to make sure he was putting excessive politics aside and putting the country first.",2008-10-02,Republican

Two weeks before that, he said George  weve made great economic progress under George Bushs policies. Nine oclock, the economy was strong. Eleven oclock that same day, two Mondays ago, John McCain said that we have an economic crisis. That doesnt make John McCain a bad guy, but it does point out hes out of touch. Those folks on the sidelines knew that two months ago.",2008-10-02,Democrat
Ifill,"Governor Palin, you may respond.",2008-10-02,Moderator
Palin,"John McCain, in referring to the fundamental of our economy being strong, he was talking to and he was talking about the American workforce. And the American workforce is the greatest in this world, with the ingenuity and the work ethic that is just entrenched in our workforce. Thats a positive. Thats encouragement. And thats what John McCain meant. Now, what Ive done as a governor and as a mayor is (inaudible) Ive had that track record of reform. And Ive joined this team that is a team of mavericks with John McCain, also, with his track record of reform, where were known for putting partisan politics aside to just get the job done. Now, Barack Obama, of course, hes pretty much only voted along his party lines. In fact, 96 percent of his votes have been solely along party line, not having that proof for the American people to know that his commitment, too, is, you know, put the partisanship, put the special interests aside, and get down to getting business done for the people of America. Were tired of the old politics as usual. And thats why, with all due respect, I do respect your years in the U.S. Senate, but I think Americans are craving something new and different and that new energy and that new commitment thats going to come with reform. I think thats why we need to send the maverick from the Senate and put him in the White House, and Im happy to join him there.",2008-10-02,Republican
Ifill,"Governor, Senator, neither of you really answered that last question about what you would do as vice president.

Again, John McCain and I, that commitment that we have made, and were going to follow through on that, getting rid of that corruption.",2008-10-02,Republican
Palin,"One thing that Americans do at this time, also, though, is lets commit ourselves just every day American people, Joe Six Pack, hockey moms across the nation, I think we need to band together and say never again. Never will we be exploited and taken advantage of again by those who are managing our money and loaning us these dollars. We need to make sure that we demand from the federal government strict oversight of those entities in charge of our investments and our savings and we need also to not get ourselves in debt. Lets do what our parents told us before we probably even got that first credit card. Dont live outside of our means. We need to make sure that as individuals were taking personal responsibility through all of this. Its not the American peoples fault that the economy is hurting like it is, but we have an opportunity to learn a heck of a lot of good lessons through this and say never again will we be taken advantage of.",2008-10-02,Republican
Ifill,Senator?,2008-10-02,Moderator
Biden,"Well Gwen, two years ago Barack Obama warned about the sub prime mortgage crisis. John McCain said shortly after that in December he was surprised there was a sub prime mortgage problem. John McCain while Barack Obama was warning about what we had to do was literally giving an interview to The Wall Street Journal saying that Im always for cutting regulations. We let Wall Street run wild. John McCain and hes a good man, but John McCain thought the answer is that tried and true Republican response, deregulate, deregulate. So what you had is you had overwhelming deregulation. You had actually the belief that Wall Street could self-regulate itself. And while Barack Obama was talking about reinstating those regulations, John on 20 different occasions in the previous year and a half called for more deregulation. As a matter of fact, John recently wrote an article in a major magazine saying that he wants to do for the health care industry deregulate it and let the free market move like he did for the banking industry. So deregulation was the promise. And guess what? Those people who say dont go into debt, they can barely pay to fill up their gas tank. I was recently at my local gas station and asked a guy named Joey Danco (ph). I said Joey, how much did it cost to fill your tank? You know what his answer was? He said I dont know, Joe. I never have enough money to do it. The middle class needs relief, tax relief. They need it now. They need help now. The focus will change with Barack Obama.",2008-10-02,Democrat
Ifill,"Governor, please if you want to respond to what he said about Senator McCains comments about health care?",2008-10-02,Moderator
Palin,"I would like to respond about the tax increases. We can speak in agreement here that darn right we need tax relief for Americans so that jobs can be created here. Now, Barack Obama and Senator Biden also voted for the largest tax increases in U.S. history. Barack had 94 opportunities to side on the peoples side and reduce taxes and 94 times he voted to increase taxes or not support a tax reduction, 94 times. Now, thats not what we need to create jobs and really bolster and heat up our economy. We do need the private sector to be able to keep more of what we earn and produce. Government is going to have to learn to be more efficient and live with less if thats what it takes to reign in the government growth that weve seen today. But we do need tax relief and Barack Obama even supported increasing taxes as late as last year for those families making only $42,000 a year. Thats a lot of middle income average American families to increase taxes on them. I think that is the way to kill jobs and to continue to harm our economy.",2008-10-02,Republican
Ifill,Senator?,2008-10-02,Moderator
Biden,"The charge is absolutely not true. Barack Obama did not vote to raise taxes. The vote shes referring to, John McCain voted the exact same way. It was a budget procedural vote. John McCain voted the same way. It did not raise taxes. Number two, using the standard that the governor uses, John McCain voted 477 times to raise taxes. Its a bogus standard it but if you notice, Gwen, the governor did not answer the question about deregulation, did not answer the question of defending John McCain about not going along with the deregulation, letting Wall Street run wild. He did support deregulation almost across the board. Thats why we got into so much trouble.",2008-10-02,Democrat
Ifill,Would you like to have an opportunity to answer that before we move on?,2008-10-02,Moderator
Palin,"Im still on the tax thing because I want to correct you on that again. And I want to let you know what I did as a mayor and as a governor. And I may not answer the questions the way that either the moderator or you want to hear, but Im going to talk straight to the American people and let them know my track record also. As mayor, every year I was in office I did reduce taxes. I eliminated personal property taxes and eliminated small business inventory taxes and as governor we suspended our state fuel tax. We did all of those things knowing that that is how our economy would be heated up. Now, as for John McCains adherence to rules and regulations and pushing for even harder and tougher regulations, that is another thing that he is known for though. Look at the tobacco industry. Look at campaign finance reform.",2008-10-02,Republican
Ifill,"OK, our time is up here. Weve got to move to the next question. Senator Biden, we want to talk about taxes, lets talk about taxes. You proposed raising taxes on people who earn over $250,000 a year. The question for you is, why is that not class warfare and the same question for you, Governor Palin, is you have proposed a tax employer health benefits which some studies say would actually throw five million more people onto the roles of the uninsured. I want to know why that isnt taking things out on the poor, starting with you, Senator Biden.",2008-10-02,Moderator
Biden,"Well Gwen, where I come from, its called fairness, just simple fairness. The middle class is struggling. The middle class under John McCains tax proposal, 100 million families, middle class families, households to be precise, they got not a single change, they got not a single break in taxes. No one making less than $250,000 under Barack Obamas plan will see one single penny of their tax raised whether its their capital gains tax, their income tax, investment tax, any tax. And 95 percent of the people in the United States of America making less than $150,000 will get a tax break. Now, that seems to me to be simple fairness. The economic engine of America is middle class. Its the people listening to this broadcast. When you do well, America does well. Even the wealthy do well. This is not punitive. John wants to add $300 million, billion in new tax cuts per year for corporate America and the very wealthy while giving virtually nothing to the middle class. We have a different value set. The middle class is the economic engine. Its fair. They deserve the tax breaks, not the super wealthy who are doing pretty well. They dont need any more tax breaks. And by the way, theyll pay no more than they did under Ronald Reagan.",2008-10-02,Democrat
Ifill,Governor?,2008-10-02,Moderator
Palin,"I do take issue with some of the principle there with that redistribution of wealth principle that seems to be espoused by you. But when you talk about Baracks plan to tax increase affecting only those making $250,000 a year or more, youre forgetting millions of small businesses that are going to fit into that category. So theyre going to be the ones paying higher taxes thus resulting in fewer jobs being created and less productivity. Now you said recently that higher taxes or asking for higher taxes or paying higher taxes is patriotic. In the middle class of America which is where Todd and I have been all of our lives, thats not patriotic. Patriotic is saying, government, you know, youre not always the solution. In fact, too often youre the problem so, government, lessen the tax burden and on our families and get out of the way and let the private sector and our families grow and thrive and prosper. An increased tax formula that Barack Obama is proposing in addition to nearly a trillion dollars in new spending that hes proposing is the backwards way of trying to grow our economy.",2008-10-02,Republican
Ifill,"Governor, are you interested in defending Senator McCains health care plan?",2008-10-02,Moderator
Palin,"I am because hes got a good health care plan that is detailed. And I want to give you a couple details on that. Hes proposing a $5,000 tax credit for families so that they can get out there and they can purchase their own health care coverage. Thats a smart thing to do. Thats budget neutral. That doesnt cost the government anything as opposed to Barack Obamas plan to mandate health care coverage and have universal government run program and unless youre pleased with the way the federal government has been running anything lately, I dont think that its going to be real pleasing for Americans to consider health care being taken over by the feds. But a $5,000 health care credit through our income tax thats budget neutral. Thats going to help. And he also wants to erase those artificial lines between states so that through competition, we can cross state lines and if theres a better plan offered somewhere else, we would be able to purchase that. So affordability and accessibility will be the keys there with that $5,000 tax credit also being offered.",2008-10-02,Republican

Biden,"Gwen, I dont know where to start. We dont call a redistribution in my neighborhood Scranton, Claymont, Wilmington, the places I grew up, to give the fair to say that not giving Exxon Mobil another $4 billion tax cut this year as John calls for and giving it to middle class people to be able to pay to get their kids to college, we dont call that redistribution. We call that fairness number one. Number two fact, 95 percent of the small businesses in America, their owners make less than $250,000 a year. They would not get one single solitary penny increase in taxes, those small businesses.",2008-10-02,Democrat
Biden,"Now, with regard to the  to the health care plan, you know, its with one hand you giveth, the other you take it. You know how Barack Obama  excuse me, do you know how John McCain pays for his $5,000 tax credit youre going to get, a family will get? He taxes as income every one of you out there, every one of you listening who has a health care plan through your employer. Thats how he raises $3.6 trillion, on your  taxing your health care benefit to give you a $5,000 plan, which his Web site points out will go straight to the insurance company. And then youre going to have to replace a $12,000  thats the average cost of the plan you get through your employer  it costs $12,000. Youre going to have to pay  replace a $12,000 plan, because 20 million of you are going to be dropped. Twenty million of you will be dropped. So youre going to have to place  replace a $12,000 plan with a $5,000 check you just give to the insurance company. I call that the Ultimate Bridge to Nowhere.",2008-10-02,Democrat

Biden,"Well, the one thing we might have to slow down is a commitment we made to double foreign assistance. Well probably have to slow that down. We also are going to make sure that we do not go forward with the tax cut proposals of the administration  of John McCain, the existing one for people making over $250,000, which is $130 billion this year alone. Were not going to support the $300 billion tax cut that they have for corporate America and the very wealthy. Were not going to support another $4 billion tax cut for ExxonMobil. And what were not going to also hold up on, Gwen, is we cannot afford to hold up on providing for incentives for new jobs by an energy policy, creating new jobs. We cannot slow up on education, because thats the engine that is going to give us the economic growth and competitiveness that we need. And we are not going to slow up on the whole idea of providing for affordable health care for Americans, none of which, when we get to talk about health care, is as my  as the governor characterized  characterized. The bottom line here is that we are going to, in fact, eliminate those wasteful spending that exist in the budget right now, a number of things I dont have time, because the light is blinking, that I wont be able to mention, but one of which is the $100 billion tax dodge that, in fact, allows people to take their post office box off- shore, avoid taxes.

Palin,"Well, the nice thing about running with John McCain is I can assure you he doesnt tell one thing to one group and then turns around and tells something else to another group, including his plans that will make this bailout plan, this rescue plan, even better. I want to go back to the energy plan, though, because this is  this is an important one that Barack Obama, he voted for in 05. Senator Biden, you would remember that, in that energy plan that Obama voted for, thats what gave those oil companies those big tax breaks. Your running mate voted for that. You know what I had to do in the state of Alaska? I had to take on those oil companies and tell them, No, you know, any of the greed there that has been kind of instrumental, I guess, in their mode of operation, that wasnt going to happen in my state. And thats why Tillerson at Exxon and Mulva at ConocoPhillips, bless their hearts, theyre doing what they need to do, as corporate CEOs, but theyre not my biggest fans, because what I had to do up there in Alaska was to break up a monopoly up there and say, you know, the people are going to come first and were going to make sure that we have value given to the people of Alaska with those resources. And those huge tax breaks arent coming to the big multinational corporations anymore, not when it adversely affects the people who live in a state and, in this case, in a country who should be benefiting at the same time. So it was Barack Obama who voted for that energy plan that gave those tax breaks to the oil companies that I then had to turn around, as a governor of an energy-producing state, and kind of undo in my own area of expertise, and thats energy.",2008-10-02,Republican

So there hasnt been a whole lot that Ive promised, except to do what is right for the American people, put government back on the side of the American people, stop the greed and corruption on Wall Street. And the rescue plan has got to include that massive oversight that Americans are expecting and deserving. And I dont believe that John McCain has made any promise that he would not be able to keep, either.",2008-10-02,Republican
Ifill,Senator?,2008-10-02,Moderator

When there were separate votes on eliminating the tax breaks for the oil companies, Barack Obama voted to eliminate them. John did not. And, look, I agree with the governor. She imposed a windfall profits tax up there in Alaska. Thats what Barack Obama and I want to do. We want to be able to do for all of you Americans, give you back $1,000 bucks, like shes been able to give back money to her folks back there. But John McCain will not support a windfall profits tax. Theyve made $600 billion since 2001, and John McCain wants to give them, all by itself  separate, no additional bill, all by itself  another $4 billion tax cut. If that is not proof of what I say, Im not sure what can be. So I hope the governor is able to convince John McCain to support our windfall profits tax, which she supported in Alaska, and I give her credit for it.",2008-10-02,Democrat
Ifill,"Next question, Governor Palin, still on the economy. Last year, Congress passed a bill that would make it more difficult for debt-strapped mortgage-holders to declare bankruptcy, to get out from under that debt. This is something that John McCain supported. Would you have?",2008-10-02,Moderator
Palin,"Yes, I would have. But here, again, there have  there have been so many changes in the conditions of our economy in just even these past weeks that there has been more and more revelation made aware now to Americans about the corruption and the greed on Wall Street. We need to look back, even two years ago, and we need to be appreciative of John McCains call for reform with Fannie Mae, with Freddie Mac, with the mortgage-lenders, too, who were starting to really kind of rear that head of abuse. And the colleagues in the Senate werent going to go there with him. So we have John McCain to thank for at least warning people. And we also have John McCain to thank for bringing in a bipartisan effort people to the table so that we can start putting politics aside, even putting a campaign aside, and just do whats right to fix this economic problem that we are in. It is a crisis. Its a toxic mess, really, on Main Street thats affecting Wall Street. And now we have to be ever vigilant and also making sure that credit markets dont seize up. Thats where the Main Streeters like me, thats where we would really feel the effects.",2008-10-02,Republican
Ifill,"Senator Biden, you voted for this bankruptcy bill. Senator Obama voted against it. Some people have said that mortgage- holders really paid the price.",2008-10-02,Moderator
Biden,"Well, mortgage-holders didnt pay the price. Only 10 percent of the people who are  have been affected by this whole switch from Chapter 7 to Chapter 13  it gets complicated. But the point of this  Barack Obama saw the glass as half- empty. I saw it as half-full. We disagreed on that, and 85 senators voted one way, and 15 voted the other way. But heres the deal. Barack Obama pointed out two years ago that there was a subprime mortgage crisis and wrote to the secretary of Treasury. And he said, Youd better get on the stick here. Youd better look at it. John McCain said as early as last December, quote  Im paraphrasing  Im surprised about this subprime mortgage crisis, number one. Number two, with regard to bankruptcy now, Gwen, what we should be doing now  and Barack Obama and I support it  we should be allowing bankruptcy courts to be able to re-adjust not just the interest rate youre paying on your mortgage to be able to stay in your home, but be able to adjust the principal that you owe, the principal that you owe. That would keep people in their homes, actually help banks by keeping it from going under. But John McCain, as I understand it  Im not sure of this, but I believe John McCain and the governor dont support that. There are ways to help people now. And there  ways that were offering are not being supported by  by the Bush administration nor do I believe by John McCain and Governor Palin.",2008-10-02,Democrat
Ifill,"Governor Palin, is that so?",2008-10-02,Moderator
Palin,"That is not so, but because thats just a quick answer, I want to talk about, again, my record on energy versus your tickets energy ticket, also. I think that this is important to come back to, with that energy policy plan again that was voted for in 05. When we talk about energy, we have to consider the need to do all that we can to allow this nation to become energy independent. Its a nonsensical position that we are in when we have domestic supplies of energy all over this great land. And East Coast politicians who dont allow energy-producing states like Alaska to produce these, to tap into them, and instead were relying on foreign countries to produce for us.",2008-10-02,Republican
Palin,"Were circulating about $700 billion a year into foreign countries, some who do not like America  they certainly dont have our best interests at heart  instead of those dollars circulating here, creating tens of thousands of jobs and allowing domestic supplies of energy to be tapped into and start flowing into these very, very hungry markets. Energy independence is the key to this nations future, to our economic future, and to our national security. So when we talk about energy plans, its not just about who got a tax break and who didnt. And were not giving oil companies tax breaks, but its about a heck of a lot more than that. Energy independence is the key to Americas future.",2008-10-02,Republican

Palin,"Yes. Well, as the nations only Arctic state and being the governor of that state, Alaska feels and sees impacts of climate change more so than any other state. And we know that its real. Im not one to attribute every man  activity of man to the changes in the climate. There is something to be said also for mans activities, but also for the cyclical temperature changes on our planet. We have got to clean up this planet. We have got to encourage other nations also to come along with us with the impacts of climate change, what we can do about that. As governor, I was the first governor to form a climate change sub-cabinet to start dealing with the impacts. Weve got to reduce emissions. John McCain is right there with an all of the above approach to deal with climate change impacts. Weve got to become energy independent for that reason. Also as we rely more and more on other countries that dont care as much about the climate as we do, were allowing them to produce and to emit and even pollute more than America would ever stand for. So even in dealing with climate change, its all the more reason that we have an all of the above approach, tapping into alternative sources of energy and conserving fuel, conserving our petroleum products and our hydrocarbons so that we can clean up this planet and deal with climate change.",2008-10-02,Republican
Ifill,"Senator, what is true and what is false about the causes?",2008-10-02,Moderator
Biden,"Well, I think it is manmade. I think its clearly manmade. And, look, this probably explains the biggest fundamental difference between John McCain and Barack Obama and Sarah Palin and Joe Biden  Governor Palin and Joe Biden. If you dont understand what the cause is, its virtually impossible to come up with a solution. We know what the cause is. The cause is manmade. Thats the cause. Thats why the polar icecap is melting. Now, lets look at the facts. We have 3 percent of the worlds oil reserves. We consume 25 percent of the oil in the world. John McCain has voted 20 times in the last decade-and-a-half against funding alternative energy sources, clean energy sources, wind, solar, biofuels. The way in which we can stop the greenhouse gases from emitting. We believe  Barack Obama believes by investing in clean coal and safe nuclear, we can not only create jobs in wind and solar here in the United States, we can export it. China is building one to three new coal-fired plants burning dirty coal per week. Its polluting not only the atmosphere but the West Coast of the United States. We should export the technology by investing in clean coal technology. We should be creating jobs. John McCain has voted 20 times against funding alternative energy sources and thinks, I guess, the only answer is drill, drill, drill. Drill we must, but it will take 10 years for one drop of oil to come out of any of the wells that are going to begun to be drilled. In the meantime, were all going to be in real trouble.",2008-10-02,Democrat

Palin,"Yes, Senator McCain does support this. The chant is drill, baby, drill. And thats what we hear all across this country in our rallies because people are so hungry for those domestic sources of energy to be tapped into. They know that even in my own energy-producing state we have billions of barrels of oil and hundreds of trillions of cubic feet of clean, green natural gas. And were building a nearly $40 billion natural gas pipeline which is North Americas largest and most you expensive infrastructure project ever to flow those sources of energy into hungry markets. Barack Obama and Senator Biden, youve said no to everything in trying to find a domestic solution to the energy crisis that were in. You even called drilling  safe, environmentally-friendly drilling offshore as raping the outer continental shelf. There  with new technology, with tiny footprints even on land, it is safe to drill and we need to do more of that. But also in that all of the above approach that Senator McCain supports, the alternative fuels will be tapped into: the nuclear, the clean coal. I was surprised to hear you mention that because you had said that there isnt anything  such a thing as clean coal. And I think you said it in a rope line, too, at one of your rallies.",2008-10-02,Republican

I was talking about exporting that technology to China so when they burn their dirty coal, it wont be as dirty, it will be clean. But heres the bottom line, Gwen: How do we deal with global warming with continued addition to carbon emissions? And if the only answer you have is oil, and John  and the governor says John is for everything. Well, why did John vote 20 times? Maybe hes for everything as long as its not helped forward by the government. Maybe hes for everything if the free market takes care of it. I dont know.

Do I support granting same-sex benefits? Absolutely positively.

The fact of the matter is that under the Constitution we should be granted  same-sex couples should be able to have visitation rights in the hospitals, joint ownership of property, life insurance policies, et cetera. Thats only fair. Its what the Constitution calls for. And so we do support it. We do support making sure that committed couples in a same-sex marriage are guaranteed the same constitutional benefits as it relates to their property rights, their rights of visitation, their rights to insurance, their rights of ownership as heterosexual couples do.",2008-10-02,Moderator

But I also want to clarify, if theres any kind of suggestion at all from my answer that I would be anything but tolerant of adults in America choosing their partners, choosing relationships that they deem best for themselves, you know, I am tolerant and I have a very diverse family and group of friends and even within that group you would see some who may not agree with me on this issue, some very dear friends who dont agree with me on this issue. But in that tolerance also, no one would ever propose, not in a McCain-Palin administration, to do anything to prohibit, say, visitations in a hospital or contracts being signed, negotiated between parties. But I will tell Americans straight up that I dont support defining marriage as anything but between one man and one woman, and I think through nuances we can go round and round about what that actually means.

We cannot afford to lose there or were going to be no better off in the war in Afghanistan either. We have got to win in Iraq. And with the surge that has worked were now down to presurge numbers in Iraq. Thats where we can be. We can start putting more troops in Afghanistan as we also work with our NATO allies who are there strengthening us and we need to grow our military.

Number two, with regard to Barack Obama not  quote  funding the troops, John McCain voted the exact same way. John McCain voted against funding the troops because of an amendment he voted against had a timeline in it to draw down American troops. And John said Im not going to fund the troops if in fact theres a timeline. Barack Obama and I agree fully and completely on one thing: Youve got to have a time line to draw down the troops and shift responsibility to the Iraqis. Were spending $10 billion a month while Iraqis have an $80 billion surplus. Barack says its time for them to spend their own money and have the 400,000 military we trained for them begin to take their own responsibility and gradually over six months  16 months, withdrawal.

You guys opposed the surge. The surge worked. Barack Obama still cant admit the surge works. Well know when were finished in Iraq when the Iraqi government can govern its people and when the Iraqi security forces can secure its people. And our commanders on the ground will tell us when those conditions have been met. And Maliki and Talabani also in working with us are knowing again that we are getting closer and closer to that point, that victory thats within sight. Now, you said regarding Senator McCains military policies there, Senator Biden, that you supported a lot of these things. In fact, you said in fact that you wanted to run, youd be honored to run with him on the ticket, and thats an indication I think of some of the support that you had at least until you became the VP pick here. You also said that Barack Obama was not ready to be commander in chief. And I know again that you opposed the move that he made to try to cut off funding for the troops and I respect you for that. I dont know how you can defend that position now, but I know that you know especially with your son in the National Guard and I have great respect for your family also and the honor that you show our military.

He voted against it. He voted against funding because he said the amendment had a time line in it to end this war, and he didnt like that. But lets get straight who has been right and wrong. John McCain and Dick Cheney said when I was saying we would not be greeted as liberators, we would not  this war would take a decade, not a day, not a week, not six months, we would not be out of there quickly. John McCain was saying the Sunnis and Shias got along with each other without reading the history of the last 700 years. John McCain said there would be enough oil to pay for this.

Biden,"Well, theyre both extremely dangerous. I always am focused, as you know Gwen, I have been focusing on for a long time, along with Barack on Pakistan. Pakistan already has nuclear weapons. Pakistan already has deployed nuclear weapons. Pakistans weapons can already hit Israel and the Mediterranean. Iran getting a nuclear weapon would be very, very destabilizing. They are more than  they are not close to getting a nuclear weapon thats able to be deployed. So theyre both very dangerous. They both would be game changers. But look, heres what the fundamental problem I have with Johns policy about terror instability. John continues to tell us that the central war in the front on terror is in Iraq. I promise you, if an attack comes in the homeland, its going to come as our security services have said, it is going to come from al Qaeda planning in the hills of Afghanistan and Pakistan. Thats where they live. Thats where they are. Thats where it will come from. And right now that resides in Pakistan. A stable government needs to be established. We need to support that democracy by helping them not only with their military but with their governance and their economic well-being. There have been 7,000 madrasses built along that border. We should be helping them build schools to compete for those hearts and minds of the people in the region so that were actually able to take on terrorism.

Palin,"Both are extremely dangerous, of course. And as for who termed that central war on terror being in Iraq, it was General Petraeus and al Qaeda, both leaders there and its probably the only thing that theyre ever going to agree on, but that it was a central war on terror is in Iraq. You dont have to believe me or John McCain on that. I would believe Petraeus and that leader of al Qaeda. An armed, nuclear armed especially, Iran is so extremely dangerous to consider. They cannot be allowed to acquire nuclear weapons period. Israel is in jeopardy of course when were dealing with Ahmadinejad as a leader of Iran. Iran claiming that Israel is, he termed it, a stinking corpse, a country that should be wiped off the face of the earth. Now a leader like Ahmadinejad who is not sane or stable when he says things like that is not one whom we can allow to acquire nuclear energy, nuclear weapons. Ahmadinejad, Kim Jong Il, the Castro brothers, others who are dangerous dictators are ones that Barack Obama has said he would be willing to meet with without preconditions being met first. An issue like that taken up by a presidential candidate goes beyond naivete and goes beyond poor judgment. A statement that he made like that is downright dangerous, because leaders like Ahmadinejad who would seek to acquire nuclear weapons and wipe off the face of the earth an ally like we have in Israel should not be met with without preconditions and diplomatic efforts being undertaken first.",2008-10-02,Republican
Ifill,"Governor and senator, I want you both to respond to this. Secretaries of State Baker, Kissinger, Powell, they have all advocated some level of engagement with enemies. Do you think these former secretaries of state are wrong on that?",2008-10-02,Moderator
Palin,"No, and Dr. Henry Kissinger especially. I had a good conversation with him recently. And he shared with me also his passion for diplomacy. And thats what John McCain and I would engage in also. But again, with some of these dictators who hate America and hate what we stand for, with our freedoms, our democracy, our tolerance, our respect for womens rights, those who would try to destroy what we stand for cannot be met with just sitting down on a presidential level as Barack Obama had said he would be willing to do. That is beyond bad judgment. That is dangerous. No, diplomacy is very important. First and foremost, that is what we would engage in. But diplomacy is hard work by serious people. Its lining out clear objectives and having your friends and your allies ready to back you up there and have sanctions lined up also before any kind of presidential summit would take place.",2008-10-02,Republican
Ifill,Senator?,2008-10-02,Moderator
Biden,Can I clarify this? Thats just simply not true about Barack Obama. He did not say sit down with Ahmadinejad.,2008-10-02,Democrat
Biden,"The fact of the matter is, it surprises me that Senator McCain doesnt realize that Ahmadinejad does not control the security apparatus in Iran. The theocracy controls the security apparatus, number one. Number two, five secretaries of state did say we should talk with and sit down. Now, John and Governor Palin now say theyre all for  they have a passion, I think the phrase was, a passion for diplomacy and that we have to bring our friends and allies along. Our friends and allies have been saying, Gwen, Sit down. Talk. Talk. Talk. Our friends and allies have been saying that, five secretaries of state, three of them Republicans. And look what President Bush did. After five years, he finally sent a high-ranking diplomat to meet with the highest-ranking diplomats in Iran, in Europe, to try to work out an arrangement. The last point Ill make, John McCain said as recently as a couple of weeks ago he wouldnt even sit down with the government of Spain, a NATO ally that has troops in Afghanistan with us now.

Palin,"A two-state solution is the solution. And Secretary Rice, having recently met with leaders on one side or the other there, also, still in these waning days of the Bush administration, trying to forge that peace, and that needs to be done, and that will be top of an agenda item, also, under a McCain-Palin administration. Israel is our strongest and best ally in the Middle East. We have got to assure them that we will never allow a second Holocaust, despite, again, warnings from Iran and any other country that would seek to destroy Israel, that that is what they would like to see. We will support Israel. A two-state solution, building our embassy, also, in Jerusalem, those things that we look forward to being able to accomplish, with this peace-seeking nation, and they have a track record of being able to forge these peace agreements. They succeeded with Jordan. They succeeded with Egypt. Im sure that were going to see more success there, also. Its got to be a commitment of the United States of America, though.

I would have never, ever joined this ticket were I not absolutely sure Barack Obama shared my passion. But you asked a question about whether or not this administrations policy had made sense or something to that effect. It has been an abject failure, this administrations policy. In fairness to Secretary Rice, shes trying to turn it around now in the seventh or eighth year. Heres what the president said when we said no. He insisted on elections on the West Bank, when I said, and others said, and Barack Obama said, Big mistake. Hamas will win. Youll legitimize them. What happened? Hamas won. When we kicked  along with France, we kicked Hezbollah out of Lebanon, I said and Barack said, Move NATO forces in there. Fill the vacuum, because if you dont know  if you dont, Hezbollah will control it. Now whats happened? Hezbollah is a legitimate part of the government in the country immediately to the north of Israel. The fact of the matter is, the policy of this administration has been an abject failure. And speaking of freedom being on the march, the only thing on the march is Iran. Its closer to a bomb. Its proxies now have a major stake in Lebanon, as well as in the Gaza Strip with Hamas.",2008-10-02,Democrat
Palin,"No, I do not believe that it has been. But Im so encouraged to know that we both love Israel, and I think that is a good thing to get to agree on, Senator Biden. I respect your position on that. No, in fact, when we talk about the Bush administration, theres a time, too, when Americans are going to say, Enough is enough with your ticket, on constantly looking backwards, and pointing fingers, and doing the blame game. There have been huge blunders in the war. There have been huge blunders throughout this administration, as there are with every administration. But for a ticket that wants to talk about change and looking into the future, theres just too much finger-pointing backwards to ever make us believe that thats where youre going. Positive change is coming, though. Reform of government is coming. Well learn from the past mistakes in this administration and other administrations. And were going to forge ahead with putting government back on the side of the people and making sure that our country comes first, putting obsessive partisanship aside. Thats what John McCain has been known for in all these years. He has been the maverick. He has ruffled feathers.

I havent heard how his policy is going to be different on Iran than George Bushs. I havent heard how his policy is going to be different with Israel than George Bushs. I havent heard how his policy in Afghanistan is going to be different than George Bushs. I havent heard how his policy in Pakistan is going to be different than George Bushs. It may be.

Palin,"Nuclear weaponry, of course, would be the be all, end all of just too many people in too many parts of our planet, so those dangerous regimes, again, cannot be allowed to acquire nuclear weapons, period. Our nuclear weaponry here in the U.S. is used as a deterrent. And thats a safe, stable way to use nuclear weaponry. But for those countries  North Korea, also, under Kim Jong-il  we have got to make sure that were putting the economic sanctions on these countries and that we have friends and allies supporting us in this to make sure that leaders like Kim Jong-il and Ahmadinejad are not allowed to acquire, to proliferate, or to use those nuclear weapons. It is that important.",2008-10-02,Republican
Ifill,Certainly.,2008-10-02,Moderator
Palin,"OK, Id like to just really quickly mention there, too, that when you look back and you say that the Bush administrations policy on Afghanistan perhaps would be the same as McCain, and thats not accurate. The surge principles, not the exact strategy, but the surge principles that have worked in Iraq need to be implemented in Afghanistan, also. And that, perhaps, would be a difference with the Bush administration. Now, Barack Obama had said that all were doing in Afghanistan is air-raiding villages and killing civilians. And such a reckless, reckless comment and untrue comment, again, hurts our cause. Thats not what were doing there. Were fighting terrorists, and were securing democracy, and were building schools for children there so that there is opportunity in that country, also. There will be a big difference there, and we will win in  in Afghanistan, also.",2008-10-02,Republican
Ifill,"Senator, you may talk about nuclear use, if youd like, and also about Afghanistan.",2008-10-02,Moderator
Biden,"Ill talk about both. With Afghanistan, facts matter, Gwen. The fact is that our commanding general in Afghanistan said today that a surge  the surge principles used in Iraq will not  well, let me say this again now  our commanding general in Afghanistan said the surge principle in Iraq will not work in Afghanistan, not Joe Biden, our commanding general in Afghanistan. He said we need more troops. We need government-building. We need to spend more money on the infrastructure in Afghanistan. Look, we have spent more money  we spend more money in three weeks on combat in Iraq than we spent on the entirety of the last seven years that we have been in Afghanistan building that country. Let me say that again. Three weeks in Iraq; seven years, seven years or six-and-a-half years in Afghanistan. Now, thats number one. Number two, with regard to arms control and weapons, nuclear weapons require a nuclear arms control regime. John McCain voted against a Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty that every Republican has supported. John McCain has opposed amending the Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty with an amendment to allow for inspections. John McCain has not been  has not been the kind of supporter for dealing with  and let me put it another way. My time is almost up. Barack Obama, first thing he did when he came to the United States Senate, new senator, reached across the aisle to my colleague, Dick Lugar, a Republican, and said, Weve got to do something about keeping nuclear weapons out of the hands of terrorists. They put together a piece of legislation that, in fact, was serious and real. Every major  I shouldnt say every  on the two at least that I named, I know that John McCain has been opposed to extending the arms control regime in the world.",2008-10-02,Democrat

Certainly, accounting for different conditions in that different country and conditions are certainly different. We have NATO allies helping us for one and even the geographic differences are huge but the counterinsurgency principles could work in Afghanistan. McClellan didnt say anything opposite of that. The counterinsurgency strategy going into Afghanistan, clearing, holding, rebuilding, the civil society and the infrastructure can work in Afghanistan. And those leaders who are over there, who have also been advising George Bush on this have not said anything different but that.",2008-10-02,Republican

The fact of the matter is that again, Ill just put in perspective, while Barack and I and Chuck Hagel and Dick Lugar have been calling for more money to help in Afghanistan, more troops in Afghanistan, John McCain was saying two years ago quote, The reason we dont read about Afghanistan anymore in the paper, its succeeded. Barack Obama was saying we need more troops there. Again, we spend in three weeks on combat missions in Iraq, more than we spent in the entire time we have been in Afghanistan. That will change in a Barack Obama administration.",2008-10-02,Republican
Ifill,"Senator, you have quite a record, this is the next question here, of being an interventionist. You argued for intervention in Bosnia and Kosovo, initially in Iraq and Pakistan and now in Darfur, putting U.S. troops on the ground. Boots on the ground. Is this something the American public has the stomach for?",2008-10-02,Moderator
Biden,"I think the American public has the stomach for success. My recommendations on Bosnia. I admit I was the first one to recommend it. They saved tens of thousands of lives. And initially John McCain opposed it along with a lot of other people. But the end result was it worked. Look what we did in Bosnia. We took Serbs, Croats and Bosniaks, being told by everyone, I was told by everyone that this would mean that they had been killing each other for a thousand years, it would never work. Theres a relatively stable government there now as in Kosovo. With regard to Iraq, I indicated it would be a mistake to  I gave the president the power. I voted for the power because he said he needed it not to go to war but to keep the United States, the UN in line, to keep sanctions on Iraq and not let them be lifted. I, along with Dick Lugar, before we went to war, said if we were to go to war without our allies, without the kind of support we need, wed be there for a decade and itd cost us tens of billions of dollars. John McCain said, no, it was going to be OK. I dont have the stomach for genocide when it comes to Darfur. We can now impose a no-fly zone. Its within our capacity. We can lead NATO if were willing to take a hard stand. We can, Ive been in those camps in Chad. Ive seen the suffering, thousands and tens of thousands have died and are dying. We should rally the world to act and demonstrate it by our own movement to provide the helicopters to get the 21,000 forces of the African Union in there now to stop this genocide.",2008-10-02,Democrat
Ifill,"Thank you, senator. Governor.",2008-10-02,Moderator
Palin,"Oh, yeah, its so obvious Im a Washington outsider. And someone just not used to the way you guys operate. Because here you voted for the war and now you oppose the war. Youre one who says, as so many politicians do, I was for it before I was against it or vice- versa. Americans are craving that straight talk and just want to know, hey, if you voted for it, tell us why you voted for it and it was a war resolution. And you had supported John McCains military strategies pretty adamantly until this race and you had opposed very adamantly Barack Obamas military strategy, including cutting off funding for the troops that attempt all through the primary. And I watched those debates, so I remember what those were all about. But as for as Darfur, we can agree on that also, the supported of the no-fly zone, making sure that all options are on the table there also. America is in a position to help. What Ive done in my position to help, as the governor of a state thats pretty rich in natural resources, we have a $40 billion investment fund, a savings fund called the Alaska Permanent Fund. When I and others in the legislature found out we had some millions of dollars in Sudan, we called for divestment through legislation of those dollars to make sure we werent doing anything that would be seen as condoning the activities there in Darfur. That legislation hasnt passed yet but it needs to because all of us, as individuals, and as humanitarians and as elected officials should do all we can to end those atrocities in that region of the world.",2008-10-02,Republican

Ifill,"What is it? BIDEN: The line that should be drawn is whether we A, first of all have the capacity to do anything about it number one. And number two, certain new lines that have to be drawn internationally. When a country engages in genocide, when a country engaging in harboring terrorists and will do nothing about it, at that point that country in my view and Baracks view forfeits their right to say you have no right to intervene at all. The truth of the matter is, though, lets go back to John McCains strategy. I never supported John McCains strategy on the war. John McCain said exactly what Dick Cheney said, go back and look at Barack Obamas statements and mine. Go look at joebiden.com, contemporaneously, held hearings in the summer before we went to war, saying if we went to war, we would not be greeted as liberator, we would have a fight between Sunnis and Shias, we would be tied down for a decade and cost us hundreds of billions of dollars. John McCain was saying the exact opposite. John McCain was lock- step with Dick Cheney at that point how this was going to be easy. So John McCains strategy in this war, not just whether or not to go, the actual conduct of the war has been absolutely wrong from the outset.",2008-10-02,Moderator

I think tomorrow morning, the pundits are going to start do the who said what at what time and well have proof of some of this, but, again, John McCain who knows how to win a war. Whos been there and hes faced challenges and he knows what evil is and knows what it takes to overcome the challenges here with our military. He knows to learn from the mistakes and blunders we have seen in the war in Iraq, especially. He will know how to implement the strategies, working with our commanders and listening to what they have to say, taking the politics out of these war issues.

A policy that would in fact engage our allies in making sure that we knew we were acting on the same page and not dictating. And a policy that would reject the Bush Doctrine of preemption and regime change and replace it with a doctrine of prevention and cooperation and, ladies and gentlemen, this is the biggest ticket item that we have in this election.

As we discuss ANWR there, at least we can agree to disagree on that one. I will keep pushing him on ANWR. I have so appreciated he has never asked me to check my opinions at the door and he wants a deliberative debate and healthy debate so we can make good policy. What I would do also, if that were to ever happen, though, is to continue the good work he is so committed to of putting government back on the side of the people and get rid of the greed and corruption on Wall Street and in Washington.

And then ask them whether theres a single major initiative that John McCain differs with the president on. On taxes, on Iraq, on Afghanistan, on the whole question of how to help education, on the dealing with health care. Look, the people in my neighborhood, they get it. They get it. They know theyve been getting the short end of the stick. So walk with me in my neighborhood, go back to my old neighborhood in Claymont, an old steel town or go up to Scranton with me.

I know education you are passionate about with your wife being a teacher for 30 years, and god bless her. Her reward is in heaven, right? I say, too, with education, America needs to be putting a lot more focus on that and our schools have got to be really ramped up in terms of the funding that they are deserving. Teachers needed to be paid more. I come from a house full of school teachers. My grandma was, my dad who is in the audience today, hes a schoolteacher, had been for many years. My brother, who I think is the best schoolteacher in the year, and heres a shout-out to all those third graders at Gladys Wood Elementary School, you get extra credit for watching the debate. Education in America has been in some sense in some of our states just accepted to be a little bit lax, and we have got to increase the standards. No Child Left Behind was implemented. Its not doing the job though. We need flexibility in No Child Left Behind. We need to put more of an emphasis on the profession of teaching. We need to make sure that education in either one of our agendas, I think, absolute top of the line. My kids as public school participants right now, its near and dear to my heart.

Im thankful that the Constitution would allow a bit more authority given to the vice president if that vice president so chose to exert it in working with the Senate and making sure that we are supportive of the presidents policies and making sure too that our president understands what our strengths are. John McCain and I have had good conversations about where I would lead with his agenda, and that is energy independence in America and reform of government over all, and then working with families of children with special needs. Thats near and dear to my heart also. And in those arenas, John McCain has already tapped me and said, thats where I want you, I want you to lead.

With regard to the role of vice president, I had a long talk, as Im sure the governor did with her principal, in my case with Barack. And let me tell you what Barack asked me to do. I have a history of getting things done in the United States Senate. John McCain would acknowledge that. My record shows that on controversial issues. I would be the point person for the legislative initiatives in the United States Congress for our administration. I would also, when asked if I wanted a portfolio, my response was, no. But Barack Obama indicated to me he wanted me with him to help him govern. So every major decision hell be making, Ill be sitting in the room to give him my best advice. Hes president, not me, Ill give my best advice. And one of the things he said early on when he was choosing, he said he picked someone who had an independent judgment and wouldnt be afraid to tell him if he disagreed.

Yeah, so I do agree with him that we have a lot of flexibility in there, and well do what we have to do to administer very appropriately the plans that are needed for this nation.

And the primary role of the vice president of the United States of America is to support the president of the United States of America, give that president his or her best judgment when sought, and as vice president, to preside over the Senate, only in a time when in fact theres a tie vote. The Constitution is explicit. The only authority the vice president has from the legislative standpoint is the vote, only when there is a tie vote. He has no authority relative to the Congress. The idea hes part of the Legislative Branch is a bizarre notion invented by Cheney to aggrandize the power of a unitary executive and look where it has gotten us.

Being a mom, being one who is very concerned about a son in the war, about a special needs child, about kids heading off to college, how are we going to pay those tuition bills? About times and Todd and our marriage in our past where we didnt have health insurance and we know what other Americans are going through as they sit around the kitchen table and try to figure out, how are they going to pay out-of-pocket for health care? Weve been there also so that connection was important. But even more important is that worldview that I share with John McCain. That worldview that says that America is a nation of exceptionalism. And we are to be that shining city on a hill, as President Reagan so beautifully said, that we are a beacon of hope and that we are unapologetic here. We are not perfect as a nation. But together, we represent a perfect ideal, and that is democracy and tolerance and freedom and equal rights.

Biden,"Others talk about my excessive passion. Im not going to change. I have 35 years in public office. People can judge who I am. I havent changed in that time. And, by the way, a record of change  I will place my record and Baracks record against John McCains or anyone else in terms of fundamental accomplishments. Wrote the crime bill, put 100,000 cops on the street, wrote the Violence Against Women Act, which John McCain voted against both of them, was the catalyst to change the circumstance in Bosnia, led by President Clinton, obviously. Look, I understand what its like to be a single parent. When my wife and daughter died and my two sons were gravely injured, I understand what its like as a parent to wonder what its like if your kids going to make it. I understand what its like to sit around the kitchen table with a father who says, Ive got to leave, champ, because theres no jobs here. I got to head down to Wilmington. And when we get enough money, honey, well bring you down. I understand what its like. Im much better off than almost all Americans now. I get a good salary with the United States Senate. I live in a beautiful house thats my total investment that I have. So I  I am much better off now. But the notion that somehow, because Im a man, I dont know what its like to raise two kids alone, I dont know what its like to have a child youre not sure is going to  is going to make it  I understand. I understand, as well as, with all due respect, the governor or anybody else, what its like for those people sitting around that kitchen table. And guess what? Theyre looking for help. Theyre looking for help. Theyre not looking for more of the same.",2008-10-02,Democrat
Ifill,Governor?,2008-10-02,Moderator
Palin,"People arent looking for more of the same. They are looking for change. And John McCain has been the consummate maverick in the Senate over all these years. Hes taken shots left and right from the other party and from within his own party, because hes had to take on his own party when the time was right, when he recognized it was time to put partisanship aside and just do what was right for the American people. Thats what Ive done as governor, also, take on my own party, when I had to, and work with both sides of the aisle, in my cabinet, appointing those who would serve regardless of party, Democrats, independents, Republicans, whatever it took to get the job done. Also, John McCains maverick position that hes in, thats really prompt up to and indicated by the supporters that he has. Look at Lieberman, and Giuliani, and Romney, and Lingle, and all of us who come from such a diverse background of  of policy and of partisanship, all coming together at this time, recognizing he is the man that we need to leave  lead in these next four years, because these are tumultuous times. We have got to win the wars. We have got to get our economy back on track. We have got to not allow the greed and corruption on Wall Street anymore. And we have not got to allow the partisanship that has really been entrenched in Washington, D.C., no matter whos been in charge. When the Republicans were in charge, I didnt see a lot of progress there, either. When the Democrats, either, though, this last go- around for the last two years. Change is coming. And John McCain is the leader of that reform.",2008-10-02,Republican
Ifill,Senator,2008-10-02,Moderator
Biden,"Ill be very brief. Can I respond to that? Look, the maverick  lets talk about the maverick John McCain is. And, again, I love him. Hes been a maverick on some issues, but he has been no maverick on the things that matter to peoples lives. He voted four out of five times for George Bushs budget, which put us a half a trillion dollars in debt this year and over $3 trillion in debt since hes got there. He has not been a maverick in providing health care for people. He has voted against  he voted including another 3.6 million children in coverage of the existing health care plan, when he voted in the United States Senate. Hes not been a maverick when it comes to education. He has not supported tax cuts and significant changes for people being able to send their kids to college. Hes not been a maverick on the war. Hes not been a maverick on virtually anything that genuinely affects the things that people really talk about around their kitchen table. He voted against even providing for what they call LIHEAP, for assistance to people, with oil prices going through the roof in the winter. So maverick he is not on the important, critical issues that affect people at that kitchen table.",2008-10-02,Democrat
Ifill,"Final question tonight, before your closing statements, starting with you, Senator Biden. Can you think of a single issue  and this is to cast light for people who are just trying to get to know you in your final debate, your only debate of this year  can you think of a single issue, policy issue, in which you were forced to change a long-held view in order to accommodate changed circumstances?",2008-10-02,Moderator
Biden,"Yes, I can. When I got to the United States Senate and went on the Judiciary Committee as a young lawyer, I was of the view and had been trained in the view that the only thing that mattered was whether or not a nominee appointed, suggested by the president had a judicial temperament, had not committed a crime of moral turpitude, and was  had been a good student. And it didnt take me long  it was hard to change, but it didnt take me long, but it took about five years for me to realize that the ideology of that judge makes a big difference. Thats why I led the fight against Judge Bork. Had he been on the court, I suspect there would be a lot of changes that I dont like and the American people wouldnt like, including everything from Roe v. Wade to issues relating to civil rights and civil liberties. And so that  that  that was one of the intellectual changes that took place in my career as I got a close look at it. And thats why I was the first chairman of the Judiciary Committee to forthrightly state that it matters what your judicial philosophy is. The American people have a right to understand it and to know it. But I did change on that, and  and Im glad I did.",2008-10-02,Democrat

Palin,"There have been times where, as mayor and governor, we have passed budgets that I did not veto and that I think could be considered as something that I quasi-caved in, if you will, but knowing that it was the right thing to do in order to progress the agenda for that year and to work with the legislative body, that body that actually holds the purse strings. So there were times when I wanted to zero-base budget, and to cut taxes even more, and I didnt have enough support in order to accomplish that. But on the major principle things, no, there hasnt been something that Ive had to compromise on, because weve always seemed to find a way to work together. Up there in Alaska, what we have done is, with bipartisan efforts, is work together and, again, not caring who gets the credit for what, as we accomplish things up there. And thats been just a part of the operation that I wanted to participate in. And thats what were going to do in Washington, D.C., also, bring in both sides together. John McCain is known for doing that, also, in order to get the work done for the American people.",2008-10-02,Republican
Ifill,"Lets come full circle. You both want to bring both sides together. You both talk about bipartisanship. Once again, we saw what happened this week in Washington. How do you change the tone, as vice president, as number-two?",2008-10-02,Moderator
Biden,"Well, again, I believe John McCain, were he here  and this is a dangerous thing to say in the middle of an election  but he would acknowledge what Im about to say. I have been able to work across the aisle on some of the most controversial issues and change my partys mind, as well as Republicans, because I learned a lesson from Mike Mansfield. Mike Mansfield, a former leader of the Senate, said to me one day  he  I made a criticism of Jesse Helms. He said, What would you do if I told you Jesse Helms and Dot Helms had adopted a child who had braces and was in real need? I said, Id feel like a jerk. He said, Joe, understand one thing. Everyones sent here for a reason, because theres something in them that their folks like. Dont question their motive. I have never since that moment in my first year questioned the motive of another member of the Congress or Senate with whom Ive disagreed. Ive questioned their judgment. I think thats why I have the respect I have and have been able to work as well as Ive been able to have worked in the United States Senate. Thats the fundamental change Barack Obama and I will be bring to this party, not questioning other peoples motives.",2008-10-02,Democrat

And we have folks of all political persuasion in there, also, so Ive grown up just knowing that, you know, at the end of the day, as long as were all working together for the greater good, its going to be OK. But the policies and the proposals have got to speak for themselves, also. And, again, voters on November 4th are going to have that choice to either support a ticket that supports policies that create jobs. You do that by lowering taxes on American workers and on our businesses. And you build up infrastructure, and you rein in government spending, and you make our  our nation energy independent. Or you support a ticket that supports policies that will kill jobs by increasing taxes. And thats what the track record shows, is a desire to increase taxes, increase spending, a trillion-dollar spending proposal thats on the table.

And I appreciate, too, Senator Biden, getting to meet you, finally, also, and getting to debate with you. And I would like more opportunity for this. I like being able to answer these tough questions without the filter, even, of the mainstream media kind of telling viewers what theyve just heard. Id rather be able to just speak to the American people like we just did. And its so important that the American people know of the choices that they have on November 4th. I want to assure you that John McCain and I, were going to fight for America. Were going to fight for the middle-class, average, everyday American family like mine. Ive been there. I know what the hurts are. I know what the challenges are. And, thank God, I know what the joys are, too, of living in America. We are so blessed. And Ive always been proud to be an American. And so has John McCain. We have to fight for our freedoms, also, economic and our national security freedoms. It was Ronald Reagan who said that freedom is always just one generation away from extinction. We dont pass it to our children in the bloodstream; we have to fight for it and protect it, and then hand it to them so that they shall do the same, or were going to find ourselves spending our sunset years telling our children and our childrens children about a time in America, back in the day, when men and women were free. We will fight for it, and there is only one man in this race who has really ever fought for you, and thats Senator John McCain.",2008-10-02,Republican

Biden,"Gwen, thank you for doing this, and the commission, and Governor, it really was a pleasure getting to meet you. Look, folks, this is the most important election youve ever voted in your entire life. No one can deny that the last eight years, weve been dug into a very deep hole here at home with regard to our economy, and abroad in terms of our credibility. And theres a need for fundamental change in our economic philosophy, as well as our foreign policy. And Barack Obama and I dont measure progress toward that change based on whether or not we cut more regulations and how well CEOs are doing, or giving another $4 billion in tax breaks to the Exxon Mobils of the world. We measure progress in America based on whether or not someone can pay their mortgage, whether or not they can send their kid to college, whether or not theyre able to, when they send their child, like we have abroad  or Im about to, abroad  and John has as well, I might add  to fight, that they are the best equipped and they have everything they need. And when they come home, theyre guaranteed that they have the best health care and the best education possible. You know, in the neighborhood I grew up in, it was all about dignity and respect. A neighborhood like most of you grew up in. And in that neighborhood, it was filled with women and men, mothers and fathers who taught their children if they believed in themselves, if they were honest, if they worked hard, if they loved their country, they could accomplish anything. We believed it, and we did. Thats why Barack Obama and I are running, to re-establish that certitude in our neighborhoods. Ladies and gentlemen, my dad used to have an expression. Hed say, champ, when you get knocked down, get up. Well, its time for America to get up together. Americas ready, youre ready, Im ready, and Barack Obama is ready to be the next president of the United States of America.

Lehrer,"Good evening, and welcome to the first of 3 debates among the major candidates for president of the United States, sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates. The candidates are: independent candidate Ross Perot, Governor Bill Clinton, the Democratic nominee, and President George Bush, the Republican nominee. I am Jim Lehrer of the MacNeil-Lehrer News Hour on PBS, and I will be the moderator for this 90-minute event, which is taking place before an audience in the athletic complex on the campus of Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri. Three journalists will be asking questions tonight. They are John Mashek of The Boston Globe, Ann Compton of ABC News, and Sander Vanocur, a freelance journalist. We will follow a format agreed to by representatives of the Clinton and Bush campaigns. That agreement contains no restrictions on the content or subject matter of the questions. Each candidate will have up to 2 minutes for a closing statement. The order of those, as well as the questioning, was determined by a drawing. The first question goes to Mr. Perot. He will have 2 minutes to answer, to be followed by rebuttals of one minute each from Governor Clinton and then President Bush. Gentlemen, good evening. The first topic tonight is what separates each of you from the other. Mr. Perot, what do you believe tonight is the single most important separating issue of this campaign?",1992-10-11,Moderator
Perot,"I think the principal that separates me is that 5 and a half million people came together on their own and put me on the ballot. I was not put on the ballot by either of the 2 parties; I was not put on the ballot by any PAC money, by any foreign lobbyist money, by any special interest money. This is a movement that came from the people. This is the way the framers of the Constitution intended our government to be, a government that comes from the people. Over time we have developed a government that comes at the people, that comes from the top down, where the people are more or less treated as objects to be programmed during the campaign with commercials and media events and fear messages and personal attacks and things of that nature. The thing that separates my candidacy and makes it unique is that this came from millions of people in 50 states all over this country who wanted a candidate that worked and belonged to nobody but them. I go into this race as their servant, and I belong to them. So this comes from the people.",1992-10-11,Independent
Lehrer,"Governor Clinton, a one minute response.",1992-10-11,Moderator
Clinton,"The most important distinction in this campaign is that I represent real hope for change, a departure from trickle-down economics, a departure from tax and spend economics, to invest in growth. But before I can do that, I must challenge the American people to change, and they must decide. Tonight I say to the President: Mr. Bush, for 12 years youve had it your way. Youve had your chance and it didnt work. Its time to change. I want to bring that change to the American people. But we must all decide first we have the courage to change for hope and a better tomorrow.",1992-10-11,Democrat
Lehrer,"President Bush, one minute response, sir.",1992-10-11,Moderator
President Bush,"Well, I think one thing that distinguishes is experience. I think weve dramatically changed the world. Ill talk about that a little bit later, but the changes are mind-boggling for world peace. Kids go to bed at night without the same fear of nuclear war. And change for change sake isnt enough. We saw that message in the late 70s when heard a lot about change, and what happened, that misery index went right through the roof. But my economic program is the kind of change we want. And the way were going to get it done is were going to have a brand new Congress. A lot of them are thrown out because of all the scandals. Ill sit down with them, Democrats and Republicans alike, and work for my agenda for American renewal, which represents real change. But Id say, if you had to separate out, I think its experience at this level.",1992-10-11,Republican
Lehrer,"Governor Clinton, how do you respond to the President on the  you have two minutes  on the question of experience? He says that is what distinguishes him from the other two of you.",1992-10-11,Moderator
Clinton,"I believe experience counts, but its not everything. Values, judgment, and the record that I have amassed in my state also should count for something. Ive worked hard to create good jobs and to educate people. My state now ranks first in the country in job growth this year, fourth in income growth, fourth in reduction of poverty, third in overall economic performance, according to a major news magazine. Thats because we believe in investing in education and in jobs. And we have to change in this country. You know, my wife, Hillary, gave me a book about a year ago in which the author defined insanity as just doing the same old thing over and over again and expecting a different result. We have got to have the courage to change. Experience is important, yes. Ive gotten a lot of good experience in dealing with ordinary people over the last year and month. Ive touched more peoples lives and seen more heartbreak and hope, more pain and more promise, than anybody else whos run for president this year. I think the American people deserve better than theyre getting. We have gone from first to thirteenth in wages in the world in the last twelve years, since Mr. Bush and Mr. Reagan have been in. Personal income has dropped while people have worked harder. In the last four years, there have been twice as many bankruptcies as new jobs created. We need a new approach. The same old experience is not relevant. Were living in a new world after the Cold War, and what works in this new world is not trickle down, not government for the benefit of the privileged few, not tax and spend, but a commitment to invest in American jobs and American education, controlling American health care costs, and bringing the American people together. That is what works. And you can have the right kind of experience and the wrong kind of experience. Mine is rooted in the real lives of real people, and it will bring real results if we have the courage to change.",1992-10-11,Democrat
Lehrer,"President Bush, one minute to respond.",1992-10-11,Moderator
Bush,"I just thought of another  another big difference here between me. I dont believe Mr. Perot feels this way, but I know Governor Clinton did because I want to accurately quote him. He thinks, I think he said, that the country is coming apart at the seams. Now, I know that the only way he can win is to make everybody believe the economys worse than it is. But this country is not coming apart at the seams, for heavens sakes. Were the United States of America. In spite of the economic problems, were the most respected economy around the world. Many would trade for it. Weve been caught up in a global slowdown. We can do much, much better, but we ought not try to convince the American people that America is a country thats coming apart at the seams. I would hate to be running for president and think that the only way I could win would be to convince everybody how horrible things are. Yes, there are big problems, and yes, people are hurting. But I believe that this Agenda for American renewal I have is the answer to do it, and I believe we can get it done now, whereas we didnt in the past, because youre going to have a whole brand new bunch of people in the Congress that are going to have to listen to the same American people Im listening to.",1992-10-11,Republican
Lehrer,"Mr. Perot, a minute response, sir.",1992-10-11,Moderator
Perot,"Well, theyve got a point. I dont have any experience in running up a $4 trillion debt. (Laughter.) I dont have any experience in gridlock government where nobody takes responsibility for anything and everybody blames everybody else. I dont have any experience in creating the worst public school system in the industrialized world, the most violent crime-ridden society in the industrialized world. But I do have a lot of experience in getting things done. So, if were at a point in history where we want to stop talking about it and do it, Ive got a lot of experience in figuring out how to solve problems, making the solutions work, and then moving on to the next one. Ive got a lot of experience in not taking 10 years to solve a 10-minute problem. So, if its time for action, I think I have experience that counts. If theres more time for gridlock and talk and finger pointing, Im the wrong man.",1992-10-11,Independent
Lehrer,"President Bush, the question goes to you. you have two minutes. And the question is this: Are there important issues of character separating you from these other two men?",1992-10-11,Moderator
Bush,"I think the American people should be the judge of that. I think character is a very important question. I said something the other day where I was accused of being like Joe McCarthy because I questioned  I put it this way; I think its wrong to demonstrate against your own country or organize demonstrations against your own country in foreign soil. I just think its wrong. I  well, maybe they say, Well, it was a youthful indiscretion. I was 19 or 20 flying off an aircraft carrier and that shaped me to be Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces. And Im sorry, but demonstrating  its not a question of patriotism. Its a question of character and judgment. They get on me  Bills gotten on me about, read my lips. When I make a mistake Ill admit it. But he has made  not admitted a mistake and I just find it impossible to understand how an American can demonstrate against his own country in a foreign land  organizing demonstrations against it when young men are held prisoner in Hanoi or kids out of the ghetto were drafted. Some say, well, youre a little old fashioned. Maybe I am, but I just dont think thats right. Now, whether its character or judgment  whatever it is  I have a big difference here on this issue and so well just have to see how it plays out. But I  I couldnt do that. And I dont think most Americans could do that. And they all say, Well, it was a long time ago. Well, lets admit it then. Say, I made a terrible mistake. How could you be Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces and have some kid say  when you have to make a tough decision, as I did in Panama or Kuwait and then have some kid jump up and say, Well, Im not going to go. The Commander-in-Chief was organizing demonstrations halfway around the world during another era. So there are differences but thats about the main area where I think we have a difference. I dont know about  well talk about that a little with Ross here in a bit.",1992-10-11,Republican
Lehrer,"Mr. Perot, you have one minute.",1992-10-11,Moderator
Perot,"I think the American people will make their own decisions on character and at a time when we have work to do and we need action I think they need to clearly understand the backgrounds of each person. I think the press can play a huge roll in making sure that the backgrounds are clearly presented in an objective way. Then, make a decision. Certainly anyone in the White House should have the character to be there. But, I think its very important to measure when and where things occurred. Did they occur when you were a young person, in your formative years? Or did they occur while you were a senior official in the federal government? When youre a senior official in the federal government spending billions of dollars in taxpayers money and youre a mature individual and you make a mistake, then that was on our ticket. If you make it as a young man, time passes. So I would say just, you know, look at all three of us. Decide who you think will do the job. Pick that person in November because believe me, as Ive said before, The partys over and its time for the clean-up crew.

But when Joe McCarthy went around this country attacking peoples patriotism he was wrong. He was wrong. And a senator from Connecticut stood up to him named Prescott Bush.

Compton,"Governor Clinton, can you lock in a level here tonight on where middle-income families can be guaranteed a tax cut or, at the very least, at what income level they can be guaranteed no tax increase?",1992-10-11,Moderator
Clinton,"The tax increase I have proposed triggers in at family incomes of $200,000 and above. Those are the people who in the 1980s had their incomes go up while their taxes went down. Middle-class people, defined as people with incomes of $52,000 and down, had their incomes go down while their taxes went up in the Reagan-Bush years because of 6 increases in the payroll taxes. So that is where my income limit would trigger.",1992-10-11,Democrat

Compton,"below 200,000",1992-10-11,Moderator
Clinton,"notwithstanding my opponents ad, my plan triggers in at gross incomes, family incomes of $200,000 and above. Then we want to give modest middle-class tax relief to restore some fairness, especially to middle- class people with families with incomes of under $60,000. In addition to that, the money that I raise from upper-income people and from asking foreign corporations just to pay the same income on their income earned in America that American corporations do will be used to give incentives back to upper-income people. I want to give people permanent incentives on investment tax credit, like President Kennedy and the Congress inaugurated in the early 60s to get industry moving again; a research and development tax credit; a low-income housing tax credit; a long-term capital gains proposal for new business and business expansions. Weve got to have no more trickle down. We dont need across-the-board tax cuts for the wealthy for nothing. We need to say heres your tax incentive: if you create American jobs, the old-fashioned way. Id like to create more millionaires than were created under Mr. Bush and Mr. Reagan, but I dont want to have 4 years where we have no growth in the private sector, and thats whats happened in the last 4 years. Were down 35,000 jobs in the private sector. We need to invest and grow, and thats what I want to do.",1992-10-11,Democrat
Lehrer,"President Bush, one minute, sir.",1992-10-11,Moderator
President Bush,"Well, let meI have to correct one thing. I didnt question the mans patriotism. I questioned his judgment and his character. What he did in Moscow, thats fine. Let him explain it. He did. I accept that. What I dont accept is demonstrating and organizing demonstrations in a foreign country when your countrys at war. Im sorry. I cannot accept that. In terms of this one on taxes spells out the biggest difference between us. I do not believe we need to go back to the Mondale proposals or the Dukakis proposals of tax and spend. Governor Clinton says $200,000 but he also says he wants to raise $150 billion. Taxing people over $200,000 will not get you $150 billion. And then when you add in his other spending proposals, regrettably you end up socking it to the working man. That old adage they usewere going to soak the rich- -were going to soak the richit always ends up being the poor cab driver or the working man that ends up paying the bill. And so I just have a different approach. I believe the way to get the deficit down is to control the growth of mandatory spending programs, and not raise taxes on the American people. Weve got a big difference there.",1992-10-11,Republican

Thats going to take money for infrastructure and investment to do that. Our foreign competitors are doing it; were not. We cannot pay off the $4 trillion debt, balance the budget and have the industries of the future and the high- paying jobs in this country without having the revenue. Were going to go through a period of shared sacrifice. Theres one challenge. Its got to be fair. Weve created a mess, dont have much to show for it and we have got to fix it.

Sander Vanocur,"Mr. President, this past week your secretary of the Army, Michael Stone, said he had no plans to abide by a congressional mandate to cut US forces in Europe from 150 to 100 thousand by the end of September 1996. Now, why, almost 50 years after the end of World War II, and with the total collapse of the Soviet Union, should American taxpayers be taxed to support armies in Europe when the Europeans have plenty of money to do it for themselves?",1992-10-11,Moderator
Bush,"Well, Sander, thats a good question, and the answer is: for 40-some years we kept the peace. If you look at the cost of not keeping the peace in Europe, it would be exorbitant. We have reduced the number of troops that are deployed and going to be deployed. I have cut defense spending. And the reason we could do that is because of our fantastic success in winning the Cold War. We never would have got there if we had gone for the nuclear freeze crowd; we never would have got there if we had listened to those that wanted to cut defense spending. I think it is important that the US stay in Europe and continue to guarantee the peace. We simply cannot pull back. Now, when anybody has a spending program they want to spend money on at home, they say, well, lets cut money out of the Defense Dept. I will accept and have accepted the recommendations of 2 proven leaders, General Colin Powell and Secretary Dick Cheney. They feel that the levels were operating at and the reductions that I have proposed are proper. And so I simply do not think we should go back to the isolation days and starting blaming foreigners. We are the sole remaining superpower, and we should be that. And we have a certain disproportionate responsibility. But I would ask the American people to understand that if we make imprudent cuts, if we go too far, we risk the peace. And I dont want to do that. Ive seen what it is like to see a war, to see the burdens of a war, and I dont want to see us make reckless cuts. Because of our programs we have been able to significantly cut defense spending. But lets not cut into the muscle, and lets not cut down our insurance policy, which is participation of American forces in NATO, the greatest peace- keeping organization ever made. Today youve got problems in Europe, still bubbling along even though Europes gone democracys route. But we are there, and I think this insurance policy is necessary. I think it goes with world leadership, and I think the levels weve come up with are just about right.",1992-10-11,Republican

Perot,"If Im poor and youre rich, and I can get you to defend me, thats good. But when the tables get turned, I ought to do my share. Right now we spend about $300 billion a year on defense, the Japanese spend around 30 billion in Asia, the Germans spend around 30 billion in Europe. For example, Germany will spend a trillion dollars building infrastructure over the next 10 years. Its kind of easy to do if you only have to pick up a $30-billion tab to defend your country. The European Community is in a position to pay a lot more than they have in the past. I agree with the president: when they couldnt, we should have; now that they can, they should. We sort of seem to have a desire to try to stay over there and control it. They dont want us to control it, very candidly. So it I think is very important for us to let them assume more and more of the burden and for us to bring that money back here and rebuild our infrastructure, because we can only be a superpower if we are an economic superpower; and we can only be an economic superpower if we have a growing, expanding job base.",1992-10-11,Independent

Clinton,"I agree with the general statement Mr. Bush made. I disagree that we need 150,000 troops to fulfill our role in Europe. We certainly must maintain an engagement there. There are certainly dangers there, there are certainly other trouble spots in the world which are closer to Europe than to the US. But 2 former defense secretaries recently issued a report saying that 100,000 or slightly fewer troops would be enough, including President Reagans former defense secretary, Mr. Carlucci. Many of the military experts whom I consulted on this agreed. Were going to have to spend more money in the future on military technology and on greater mobility, greater airlift, greater sealift, the B-22 airplane. Were going to have to do some things that are quite costly. And I simply dont believe we can afford nor do we need to keep 150,000 troops in Europe given how much the Red Army, now under the control of Russia, has been cut, the arms control agreement concluded between Mr. Bush and Mr. Yeltsin, something I have applauded. I dont think we need 150,000 troops. Let me make one other point. Mr. Bush talked about taxes. He didnt tell you that he vetoed a middle class tax cut because it would be paid for by raising taxes on the wealthy and vetoed an investment tax credit paid for by raising taxes on the wealthy.",1992-10-11,Democrat

Mashek,"Mr Perot, you talked about fairness just a minute ago and sharing the pain. As part of your plan to reduce the ballooning federal deficit, youve suggested that we raise gasoline taxes 50 cents a gallon over 5 years. Why punish the middle class consumer to such a degree?",1992-10-11,Moderator
Perot,"Its 10 cents a year cumulative. It finally gets to 50 cents at the end of the 5th year. I think punish is the wrong word. Again, see, I didnt create this problem. Were trying to solve it. Now, if you study our international competitors, some of our international competitors collect up to $3.50 a gallon in taxes, and they use that money to build infrastructure and to create jobs. We collect 35 cents, and we dont have it to spend. I know its not popular, and I understand the nature of your question. But the people who will be helped the most by it are the working people who will get the jobs created because of this tax. Why do we have to do it? Because we have so mismanaged our country over the years, and it is now time to pay the fiddler. And if we dont, we will be spending our childrens money. We have spent $4 trillion worth. An incredible number of young people are active in supporting my effort because they are deeply concerned that we have taken the American dream from them. I think its fitting that were on the campus of a university tonight. These young people, when they get out of this wonderful university, will have difficulty finding a job. Weve got to clean this mess up, leave this country in good shape, and pass on the American dream to them. Weve got to collect the taxes to do it. If theres a fairer way, Im all ears (laughter) aah. (Laughter and applause) Butbutsee, let me make it very clear. If people dont have the stomach to fix these problems, I think its a good time to face it, November.

We have a budget deficit in the federal government, but we also have an investment, a jobs, an income deficit. People are working harder for less money than they were making 10 years ago, 2- 3rds of our peoplea $1600 drop in average income in just the last 2 years. The problem I have with the Perot prescription is that almost all economists whove looked at it say that if you cut the deficit this much this quick it will increase unemployment, it will slow down the economy. Thats why I think we shouldnt do it that quickly. We have a disciplined reduction in the deficit of 50 % over the next 4 years, but first get incentives to invest in this economy, put the American people back to work. Weve got to invest and grow. 9 Nobel Prize-winning economists and 500 others, including numerous Republican and Democratic business executives, have endorsed this approach because it offers the best hope to put America back to work and get our incomes rising instead of falling.",1992-10-11,Democrat

You see, I have a fundamental difference. I agree with what hes talking about in trying to get this spending down and the discipline, although I think we ought to totally exempt Social Security. But hes talking tough medicine, and I think thats good. I disagree with the tax-and-spend philosophy. You see, I dont think we need to tax more and spend more, and then say thats going to make the problem better. And Im afraid thats what I think Im hearing from Governor Clinton. I believe what you need to do is some of what Ross is talking about: control the growth of mandatory spending and get taxes down. Hes mentioned some ways to do itand I agree with those. Ive been talking about getting a capital gains cut forever, and his friends in Congress have been telling me thats a tax break for the rich. It would stimulate investment. Im for an investment tax allowance; Im for a tax break for first- time homebuyers. And with this new Congress coming in, gridlock will be gone, and Ill sit down with them and say lets get this done.

Mashek,"Mr. President, last month you came to St. Louis to announce a very lucrative contract for McDonnell Douglas to build F-15s for Saudi Arabia. In todays Post- Dispatch, a retired saleswoman, a 75-year-old woman named Marjorie Roberts, asked if she could ask a question of the candidates. She said she wanted to register her concern about the lack of a plan to convert our defense-oriented industries into other purposes. How would you answer her.",1992-10-11,Moderator
Bush,"I assume she was supportive of the decision on McDonnell Douglas, I assume she was supporting me on the decision to sell those airplanes. I think its a good decisiontook a little heat for it, but I think it was the correct decision to do. And we worked it out, and indeed were moving forward all around the world in a much more peaceful way. So that one we came away with in creating jobs for the American people. I would simply say to her, look, take a look at what the president has proposed on job retraining. When you cut back on defense spending, some people are going to be thrown out of work. If you throw another 50,000 kids on the street because of cutting recklessly in troop levels, youre going to put a lot more out of work. I would say to them, look at the job retraining programs that were proposing. Therein is the best answer to her. And another one is: stimulate investment and savings. I mean, weve got big economic problems, but we are not coming apart at the seams; were ready for a recovery. With interest rates down and inflation down, the cruelest tax of all, caught up in a global slowdown right now, that that will change if you go with the programs Ive talked about and if you help with job retraining and education. I am a firm believer that our America 2000 education problem is the answera little longer run; its going to take awhile to educate. But it is a good program. So her best help for short term is job retraining, if she was thrown out of work at a defense plant. But tell her its not all that gloomy; were the US, we faced tough problems before. Look at the misery index when the Democrats had both the White House and the Congress. It was just right through the roof. Now, we can do better. And the way to do better is not to tax and spend but to retrain, get that control of the mandatory spending programs. Im much more optimistic about this country than some.",1992-10-11,Republican

Number one, you make more making computer chips than potato chips; and, number 2, 19 out of 20 computer chips that we have in this country now come from Japan. Weve given away whole industries. So as we phase these industries over, theres a whole of intellectual talent in these industries. A lot of these people in industries can be converted to the industries of tomorrow, and thats where the high-paying jobs are. We need to have a very carefully thought through phase-over. Now, see, we practice 19th century capitalism. The rest of the world practices 21st century capitalism. I cant handle that in a minute, but I hope we can get back into it later.

That is what I want to do. This administration may say they have a plan, but the truth is they have not even released all the money, the paltry sum of money, that Congress appropriated.

There are great plans lying all over Washington nobody ever executes. Its like having a blueprint for a house you never built. You dont have anywhere to sleep.

The second, youve got your big companies that are in trouble, including the defense industrieshave another one on that. Have a 3rd task force on new industries of the future to make sure we nail those for our country and they dont wind up in Europe and Asia. Convert from 19th to 21st century capitalism. See, we have an adversarial relationship between government and business. Our international competitors that are cleaning our plate have an intelligent relationship between government and business, and a supportive relationship. Then have another task force on crime because, next to jobs, our people are concerned about their safety. Health care, schoolsone on the debt and deficit. And finally in that 90- day period before the inauguration, put together the framework for the town hall and give the American people a Christmas present. Show them by Christmas the first cut at these plans. By the time Congress comes into session to go to work, have those plans ready to go in front of Congress. Then get off to a flying start in 93 to execute these plans. Now, there are people in this room and people on this stage whove been in meetings when I would sit there and say, Is this the one were going to talk about or do something about? Well, obviously, my orientation is lets go do it. Now, put together your plans by Christmas, be ready to go when Congress goes, nail these things.

And there was a terrible reaction internationally to Mr. Bush saying he was going to give us 4 more years of trickle-down economicsanother across-the- board tax cut and most of it going to the wealthy, with no real guarantee of investment. But I think the important thingthe important thing is to use the powers the president does have on the assumption that, given the condition of this economy, were going to keep interest rates down if we have the discipline to increase investment and reduce the debt at the same time. That is my commitment. I think the American people are ready for action. I think Congress is hungry for someone who will work with them instead of manipulate them. Someone who will not veto a bill that has an investment tax credit, middle class tax relief, research and development tax credits as Mr. Bush has done. Give me a chance to do that.

Its been very strong since Ive been president. And they recognize we got great difficulties, but theyre also much more optimistic than the pessimists we have up here tonight.

We have a four percent gap between what we pay for treasuries, and what Germany pays for one to five year treasuries. That gap is going to close, because the Arabs, the Japanese and folks in this country are going to start buying German treasuries because they can get more money.

One is weve got to have the money to be able to pay for defense, and weve got to manufacture here. Believe it or not folks, you cant ship it all overseas, youve got to make it here.

When we think of Russia, remember were thinking of many countries, now. Weve got to help them. Thats pennies on the dollar compared to renewing the cold war. Third, weve got all kinds of agreements on paper, and some that are being executed on getting rid of nuclear warheads. Russia and its republics are out of control or at best in weak control right now. Its a very unstable situation. Youve got every rich Middle Eastern country over there trying to buy nuclear weapons. As you well know. And that will lead to another five star migraine headache down the road. We really need to nail down the big intercontinental ballistic missiles, the ones that can hit us from Russia. And weve focused on the tactical. Weve made real progress there. Weve got some agreement on the nuclear, but we dont have those things put away yet. The sooner the better. So, in terms of priorities, weve got to be financially strong. Number two, weve got to take care of this missile situation and try to get the nuclear war behind us and give this thing very high priority. And number three, we need to help and support Russia and the republics in every possible way to become democratic capitalistic societies, and not just sit back and let those countries continue in turmoil.

That was their response to that sort of action. Now that the voices in the Congress and throughout the country have insisted that we do something about China, look at what has happened. China has finally agreed to stop sending us products made with prison labor. Not because we coddled them, but because the Administration was pushed into doing something about it. And recently the Chinese have announced they are going to lower some barriers to our products, which they ought to do since they have a 15 billion dollar trade surplus with the United States under Mr. Bush. The second biggest surplus next to Japan. So I would be firm. I would say if you want to continue as Most Favored Nation status for your government owned industries as well as your private ones, observe human rights in the future. Open your society.

But when you go to put somebody elses son or daughter into war, I think you got to be a little bit careful and you have to be sure that theres a military plan that can do this. You have ancient ethnic rivalries that have cropped up as Yugoslavias dissolved or getting dissolved, and it isnt going to be solved by sending in the 82nd Airborne, and Im not going to do that as commander-in-chief. I am going to stand by and use the moral persuasion of the US to get satisfaction in terms of prison camps, and were making some progress there, and in terms of getting humanitarian relief in there. And right now, as you know, the US took the lead in a no-fly operation up there in no- fly order up in the United Nations. Were working through the international organizations. Thats one thing I learned by forging that tremendous and greatlyhighly successful coalition against Saddam Hussein, the dictator. Usework internationally to do it. I am very concerned about it. I am concerned about ethnic cleansing. I am concerned about a tax on Muslims, for example, over there. But I must stop short of using American force until I know how those young men and women are going to get out of there as well as get in, know what the mission is, and define it.

We cannot send our people all over the world to solve every problem that comes up. This is basically a problem that is a primary concern to the European Community. Certainly we care about the people, we care about the children, we care about the tragedy. But it is inappropriate for us, just because theres a problem somewhere around the world, to take the sons and daughters of working peopleand make no mistake about it, our all- volunteer armed force is not made up of the sons and daughters of the beautiful people; its the working folks who send their sons and daughters to war, with a few exceptions. Its very unlike World War II, when FDRs sons flew missions. Everybody went. Its a different world now.

There are, after all, 2 million refugees now because of the problems in what was Yugoslavia, the largest number since World War II, and there may be hundreds of thousands of people who will starve or freeze to death in this winter. The US should try to work with its allies and stop it. I urged the president to support this air cover, and he didand I applaud that. I applaud the no-fly zone, and I know that hes going back to the United Nations to try to get authority to enforce it. I think we should stiffen the embargo on the Belgrade government, and I think we have to consider whether or not we should lift the arms embargo now on the Bosnians, since they are in no way in a fair fight with a heavily armed opponent bent on ethnic cleansing.

A good family is a place where love and discipline and good values are transmuted (sic) from the elders to the children, a place where people turn for refuge, and where they know theyre the most important people in the world. America has a lot of families that are in trouble today. Theres been a lot of talk about family values in this campaign. I know a lot about that. I was born to a widowed mother who gave me family values, and grandparents. Ive seen the family values of my people in Arkansas. Ive seen the family values of all these people in America who are out there killing themselves working harder for less in a country thats had the worst economic years in 50 years and the first decline in industrial production ever. I think the president owes it to family values to show that he values Americas families, whether theyre people on welfare youre trying to move from welfare to work, the working poor whom I think deserve a tax break to lift them above poverty if theyve got a child in the house and working 40 hours a week, working families who deserve a fair tax system and the opportunity for constant retraining; they deserve a strong economy. And I think they deserve a family and medical leave act. Seventy-two other nations have been able to do it. Mr. Bush vetoed it twice because he says we cant do something seventy-two other countries do, even though there was a small business exemption. So with all the talk about family values, I know about family values  I wouldnt be here without them. The best expression of my family values is that tonights my 17th wedding anniversary, and Id like to close my question by just wishing my wife a happy anniversary, and thank you, my daughter, for being here.",1992-10-19,Democrat

So I do think we need to strengthen family. When Barbara holds an AIDS baby, shes showing a certain compassion for family; when she reads to children, the same thing. I believe that discipline and respect for the law  all of these things should be taught to children, not in our schools, but families have to do that. Im appalled at the highest outrageous numbers of divorces  it happens in families, its happened in ours. But its gotten too much. And I just think that we ought to do everything we can to respect the American family. It can be a single-parent family. Those mothers need help.

A little child before theyre 18 months learns to think well of himself or herself or poorly. They develop a positive or negative self- image. At a very early age they learn how to learn. If we have children who are not surrounded with love and affection  you see, I look at my grandchildren and wonder if theyll ever learn to walk because theyre always in someones arms. And I think, my gosh, wouldnt it be wonderful if every child had that love and support. But they dont. We will not be a great country unless we have a strong family unit in every home.

Many of the countries below that used to say, well, this is the US problem  if youd get the demand down, then we wouldnt have the problem  are working cooperatively with the DEA and the military. Were using the military more now in terms of interdiction. Our funding for recovery is up, recovering the addicts. Where were not making the progress, Sander, is in  were making it in teenagers, and thank God, because I thought what Ross said was most appropriate about these families and these children. But where were not making it is with the confirmed addicts. And Ill tell you one place thats working well, and that is the private sector  Jim Burke and this task force that he has, you may know about it. Ill tell the American people, but this man said Ill get you a million dollars a day in pro bono advertising, something thats very hard for the government to do. And he went out and he did it. And people are beginning to educate through this program, teaching these kids you shouldnt use drugs. So were still in the fight.

He is alive today because of the criminal justice system. Thats a mistake. What should we do? First, we ought to prevent more of this on the street. Thirty years ago, there were three policemen for every crime. Now there are three crimes for every policeman. We need a hundred thousand more police on the street. I have a plan for that. Secondly, we ought to have treatment on demand. Thirdly, we ought to have boot camps for first-time nonviolent offenders so they can get discipline and treatment and education and get reconnected to the community before theyre severed and sent to prison, where they can learn how to be first class criminals.

My request for this year was $4.9 billion for AIDS  ten times as much per AIDS victim as per cancer victim. I think that were showing the proper compassion and concern. So I cant tell you where its coming from, but I am very much concerned about AIDS and I believe that weve got the best researchers in the world out there at NIH working the problem. Were funding them  I wish there was more money  but were funding them far more than any time in the past, and were going to keep on doing that. I dont know. I was a little disappointed in Magic because he came to me and I said, Now if you see something were not doing, get ahold of me. Call me, let me know. He went to one meeting, and then we heard that he was stepping down. So hes replaced by Mary Fisher who electrified the Republican Convention by talking about the compassion and the concern that we feel. It was a beautiful moment and I think shell do a first-class job on that commission. So I think the appeal is yes, we care. And the other thing is part of AIDS  its one of the few diseases where behavior matters. And I once called on somebody, Well, change your behavior. Is the behavior youre using prone to cause AIDS? Change the behavior. Next thing I know, one of these ACT UP groups is out saying, Bush ought to change his behavior. You cant talk about it rationally. The extremes are hurting the AIDS cause. To go into a Catholic mass in a beautiful cathedral in New York under the cause of helping in AIDS and start throwing condoms around in the mass, Im sorry, I think it sets back the cause. We cannot move to the extreme. Weve got to care. Weve got to continue everything we can at the federal and the local level. Barbara I think is doing a superb job in destroying the myth about AIDS.

If youre going to die, you dont have to go through this ten-year cycle that FDA goes through on new drugs. Believe me, people with AIDS are more than willing to take that risk. And we could be moving out to the human population a whole lot faster than we are on some of these new drugs. So I would think we can expedite the problem there. Let me go back a minute to racial divisiveness. The all- time low in our country was the Judge Thomas-Anita Hill hearings, and those senators ought to be hanging their heads in shame for what they did there. 2nd thing, there are not many times in your life when you get to talk to a whole country.

The presidents got another proposal to require them to pay $400 a year more for the next 5 years. But if you dont have the guts to control costs by changing the insurance system and taking on the bureaucracies and the regulation of health care in the private and public sector, you cant fix this problem. Costs will continue to spiral. And just remember this, folks. A lot of folks on Medicare are out there every day making the choice between food and medicine; not poor enough for Medicare-Medicaid, not wealthy enough to buy their medicine. Ive met them, people like Mary Annie and Edward Davis in Nashua, New Hampshire. All over this country, they cannot even buy medicine. So lets be careful.

And Ross properly says, okay, theres some pain in that. But Governor Clinton refuses to touch that, simply refuses. So what weve got to do is control it, let it grow for inflation, let it grow for the amount of new people added, population, and then hold the line. And I believe that is the way you get the deficit down, not by the tax-and-spend program that we hear every 4 years, whether its Mondale, Dukakis, whoever else it is.

Mr. Bush is trying to run against Lyndon Johnson and Jimmy Carter and everybody in the world but me in this race. I have proposed a managed competition plan for health care. I will say again: you cannot control health care costs simply by cutting Medicare. Look whats happened. The federal government has cut Medicare and Medicaid in the last few years, states have cut Medicaid  weve done it in Arkansas under budget pressures. But what happens? More and more people get on the rolls as poverty increases. If you dont control the health care costs of the entire system, you cannot get control of it. Look at our program. We set up a national ceiling on health care costs tied to inflation and population growth set by health care providers, not by the government. We provide for managed competition, not government models, in every states. And we control private and public health care costs. Now, just a few days ago a bipartisan commission of Republicans and Democrats  more Republicans than Democrats  said my plan will save the average family $1200 a year more than the Bush plan will by the year 2000, $2.2 trillion in the next 12 years, $400 billion a year by the end of this decade. Ive got a plan to control health care costs. But you cant just do it by cutting Medicare; you have to take on the insurance companies, the bureaucracies. And you have to have cost controls, yes. But keep in mind we are spending 30% more on health care than any country in the world, any country, and yet we have 35 million people uninsured, we have no preventing and primary care. The Oregon plan is a good start if the federal government is going to continue to abandon its responsibilities. I say if Germany can cover everybody and keep costs under inflation, if Hawaii can cover 98% of their people at lower health care costs than the rest of us, if Rochester, New York, can do it with two-thirds of the cost of the rest of it, America can do it, too.

Clinton,"Id like to thank the people of St. Louis and Washington University, the Presidential Debate Commission and all those who made this night possible. And Id like to thank those of you who are watching. Most of all, Id like to thank all of you who have touched me in some way over this last year, all the thousands of you whom Ive seen. Id like to thank the computer executives and the electronics executives in Silicon Valley, two-thirds of whom are Republicans who said they wanted to sign on to a change in America. Id like to thank the hundreds of executives who came to Chicago, a third of them Republicans, who said they wanted to change. Id like to thank the people whove started with Mr. Perot whove come on to help our campaign. Id like to thank all the folks around America that no one ever knows about  the woman that was holding the AIDS baby she adopted in Cedar Rapids, Iowa who asked me to do something more for adoption; the woman who stopped along the road in Wisconsin and wept because her husband had lost his job after 27 years; all the people who are having a tough time and the people who are winning but who know how desperately we need to change. This debate tonight has made crystal clear a challenge that is as old as America  the choice between hope and fear, change or more of the same, the courage to move into a new tomorrow or to listen to the crowd who says things could be worse. Mr. Bush has said some very compelling things tonight that dont quite square with the record. He was president for 3 years before he proposed a health care plan that still hasnt been sent to Congress in total; three years before an economic plan, and he still didnt say tonight that that tax bill he vetoed raised taxes only on the rich and gave the rest of you a break  but he vetoed it anyway. I offer a new direction. Invest in American jobs, American education, control health care costs, bring this country together again. I want the future of this country to be as bright and brilliant as its past, and it can be if we have the courage to change.",1992-10-19,Democrat

Bush,"Let me tell you a little what its like to be president. In the Oval Office, you cant predict what kind of crisis is going to come up. You have to make tough calls. You cant be on one hand this way and one hand another. You cant take different positions on these difficult issues. And then you need a philosophical  Id call it a philosophical underpinning. Mine for foreign affairs is democracy and freedom, and look at the dramatic changes around the world. The Cold War is over. The Soviet Union is no more and were working with a democratic country. Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, the Baltics are free. Take a look at the Middle East. We had to stand up against a tyrant. The US came together as we havent in many, many years. And we kicked this man out of Kuwait. And in the process, as a result of that will and that decision and that toughness, we now have ancient enemies talking peace in the Middle East. Nobody would have dreamed it possible. And I think the biggest dividend of making these tough calls is the fact that we are less afraid of nuclear war. Every parent out there has much less worry that their kids are going to be faced with nuclear holocaust. All this is good. On the domestic side, what we must do is have change that empowers people  not change for the sake of change, tax and spend. We dont need to do that any more. What we need to do is empower people. We need to invest and save. We need to do better in education. We need to do better in job retraining. We need to expand our exports, and theyre going very, very well, indeed. And we need to strengthen the American family. I hope as president that Ive earned your trust. Ive admitted it when I make a mistake, but then I go on and help, try to solve the problems. I hope Ive earned your trust because a lot of being president is about trust and character. And I ask for your support for 4 more years to finish this job. Thank you very, very much.",1992-10-19,Republican

Gibson,"Good evening from the Field House at Washington University in St. Louis. Im Charles Gibson of ABC News and Good Morning America. I welcome you to the second of the 2004 presidential debates between President George W. Bush, the Republican nominee, and Senator John Kerry, the Democratic nominee. The debates are sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates. Tonights format is going to be a bit different. We have assembled a town-hall meeting. Were in the Show-Me State, as everyone knows Missouri to be, so Missouri residents will ask the questions. These 140 citizens were identified by the Gallup Organization as not yet committed in this election. Now, earlier today, each audience member gave me two questions on cards like this, one theyd like to ask the president, the other theyd like to ask the senator. I have selected the questions to be asked and the order. No one has seen the final list of questions but me, certainly not the candidates. No audience member knows if he or she will be called upon. Audience microphones will be turned off after a question is asked. Audience members will address their question to a specific candidate. Hell have two minutes to answer. The other candidate will have a minute and a half for rebuttal. And I have the option of extending discussion for one minute, to be divided equally between the two men. All subjects are open for discussion. And you probably know the light system by now. Green light at 30 seconds, yellow at 15, red at five, and flashing red means youre done. Those are the candidates rules. I will hold the candidates to the time limits forcefully but politely, I hope. And now, please join me in welcoming with great respect, President Bush and Senator Kerry. Gentlemen, to the business at hand. The first question is for Senator Kerry, and it will come from Cheryl Otis, who is right behind me.",2004-10-08,Moderator
Otis,"Senator Kerry, after talking with several co-workers and family and friends, I asked the ones who said they were not voting for you, Why? They said that you were too wishy-washy.",2004-10-08,Moderator
Kerry,"Yes, I certainly do. But let me just first, Cheryl, if you will, I want to thank Charlie for moderating. I want to thank Washington University for hosting us here this evening. Mr. President, its good to be with you again this evening, sir. Cheryl, the president didnt find weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, so hes really turned his campaign into a weapon of mass deception. And the result is that youve been bombarded with advertisements suggesting that Ive changed a position on this or that or the other. Now, the three things they try to say Ive changed position on are the Patriot Act; I havent. I support it. I just dont like the way John Ashcroft has applied it, and were going to change a few things. The chairman of the Republican Party thinks we ought to change a few things. No Child Left Behind Act, I voted for it. I support it. I support the goals. But the president has underfunded it by $28 billion. Right here in St. Louis, youve laid off 350 teachers. Youre 150  excuse me, I think its a little more, about $100 million shy of what you ought to be under the No Child Left Behind Act to help your education system here. So I complain about that. Ive argued that we should fully funded it. The president says Ive changed my mind. I havent changed my mind: Im going to fully fund it. So these are the differences. Now, the president has presided over an economy where weve lost 1.6 million jobs. The first president in 72 years to lose jobs. I have a plan to put people back to work. Thats not wishy- washy. Im going to close the loopholes that actually encourage companies to go overseas. The president wants to keep them open. I think Im right. I think hes wrong. Im going to give you a tax cut. The president gave the top 1 percent of income-earners in America, got $89 billion last year, more than the 80 percent of people who earn $100,000 or less all put together. I think thats wrong. Thats not wishy-washy, and thats what Im fighting for, you.",2004-10-08,Democrat
Gibson,"Mr. President, a minute and a half.",2004-10-08,Moderator
Bush,"Charlie, thank you, and thank our panelists. And, Senator, thank you. I can  and thanks, Washington U. as well. I can see why people at your workplace think he changes positions a lot, because he does. He said he voted for the $87 billion, and voted against it right before he voted for it. And that sends a confusing signal to people. He said he thought Saddam Hussein was a grave threat, and now he said it was a mistake to remove Saddam Hussein from power. No, I can see why people think that he changes position quite often, because he does. You know, for a while he was a strong supporter of getting rid of Saddam Hussein. He saw the wisdom  until the Democrat primary came along and Howard Dean, the anti-war candidate, began to gain on him, and he changed positions. I dont see how you can lead this country in a time of war, in a time of uncertainty, if you change your mind because of politics. He just brought up the tax cut. You remember we increased that child credit by $1,000, reduced the marriage penalty, created a 10 percent tax bracket for the lower-income Americans. Thats right at the middle class. He voted against it. And yet he tells you hes for a middle- class tax cut. Its  youve got to be consistent when youre the president. Theres a lot of pressures. And youve got to be firm and consistent.",2004-10-08,Republican
Gibson,"Mr. President, I would follow up, but we have a series of questions on Iraq, and so I will turn to the next questioner. The question is for President Bush, and the questioner is Robin Dahle.",2004-10-08,Moderator
Dahle,"Mr. President, yesterday in a statement you admitted that Iraq did not have weapons of mass destruction, but justified the invasion by stating, I quote, He retained the knowledge, the materials, the means and the intent to produce weapons of mass destruction and could have passed this knowledge to our terrorist enemies.",2004-10-08,Moderator
Bush,"Each situation is different, Robin. And obviously we hope that diplomacy works before you ever use force. The hardest decision a president makes is ever to use force. After 9/11, we had to look at the world differently. After 9/11, we had to recognize that when we saw a threat, we must take it seriously before it comes to hurt us. In the old days wed see a threat, and we could deal with it if we felt like it or not. But 9/11 changed it all. I vowed to our countrymen that I would do everything I could to protect the American people. Thats why were bringing Al Qaida to justice. Seventy five percent of them have been brought to justice. Thats why I said to Afghanistan: If you harbor a terrorist, youre just as guilty as the terrorist. And the Taliban is no longer in power, and Al Qaida no longer has a place to plan. And I saw a unique threat in Saddam Hussein, as did my opponent, because we thought he had weapons of mass destruction. And the unique threat was that he could give weapons of mass destruction to an organization like Al Qaida, and the harm they inflicted on us with airplanes would be multiplied greatly by weapons of mass destruction. And that was the serious, serious threat. So I tried diplomacy, went to the United Nations. But as we learned in the same report I quoted, Saddam Hussein was gaming the oil-for-food program to get rid of sanctions. He was trying to get rid of sanctions for a reason: He wanted to restart his weapons programs. We all thought there was weapons there, Robin. My opponent thought there was weapons there. Thats why he called him a grave threat. I wasnt happy when we found out there wasnt weapons, and weve got an intelligence group together to figure out why. But Saddam Hussein was a unique threat. And the world is better off without him in power. And my opponents plans lead me to conclude that Saddam Hussein would still be in power, and the world would be more dangerous. Thank you, sir.",2004-10-08,Republican
Gibson,"Senator Kerry, a minute and a half.",2004-10-08,Moderator
Kerry,"Robin, Im going to answer your question. Im also going to talk  respond to what you asked, Cheryl, at the same time. The world is more dangerous today. The world is more dangerous today because the president didnt make the right judgments. Now, the president wishes that I had changed my mind. He wants you to believe that because he cant come here and tell you that hes created new jobs for America. Hes lost jobs. He cant come here and tell you that hes created health care for Americans because, what, weve got 5 million Americans who have lost their health care, 96,000 of them right here in Missouri. He cant come here and tell you that hes left no child behind because he didnt fund no child left behind. So what does he do? Hes trying to attack me. He wants you to believe that I cant be president. And hes trying to make you believe it because he wants you to think I change my mind. Well, let me tell you straight up: Ive never changed my mind about Iraq. I do believe Saddam Hussein was a threat. I always believed he was a threat. Believed it in 1998 when Clinton was president. I wanted to give Clinton the power to use force if necessary. But I would have used that force wisely, I would have used that authority wisely, not rushed to war without a plan to win the peace. I would have brought our allies to our side. I would have fought to make certain our troops had everybody possible to help them win the mission. This president rushed to war, pushed our allies aside. And Iran now is more dangerous, and so is North Korea, with nuclear weapons. He took his eye off the ball, off of Osama bin Laden.",2004-10-08,Democrat

The United Nations was not effective at removing Saddam Hussein.",2004-10-08,Republican

And if wed used smart diplomacy, we could have saved $200 billion and an invasion of Iraq. And right now, Osama bin Laden might be in jail or dead. Thats the war against terror.",2004-10-08,Democrat
Gibson,Were going to have another question now on the subject of Iraq. And Im going to turn to Anthony Baldi with a question for Senator Kerry.,2004-10-08,Moderator
Baldi,"Senator Kerry, the U.S. is preparing a new Iraq government and will proceed to withdraw U.S. troops.",2004-10-08,Moderator
Kerry,"Anthony, I would not. I have laid out a different plan, because the presidents plan is not working. You see that every night on television. Theres chaos in Iraq. King Abdullah of Jordan said just yesterday or the day before you cant hold elections in Iraq with the chaos thats going on today. Senator Richard Lugar, the Republican chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, said that the handling of the reconstruction aid in Iraq by this administration has been incompetent. Those are the Republican chairmans words. Senator Hagel of Nebraska said that the handling of Iraq is beyond pitiful, beyond embarrassing; its in the zone of dangerous. Those are the words of two Republicans, respected, both on the Foreign Relations Committee. Now, I have to tell you, I would do something different. I would reach out to our allies in a way that this president hasnt. He pushed them away time and again, pushed them away at the U.N., pushed them away individually. Two weeks ago, there was a meeting of the North Atlantic Council, which is the political arm of NATO. They discussed the possibility of a small training unit or having a total takeover of the training in Iraq. Did our administration push for the total training of Iraq? No. Were they silent? Yes. Was there an effort to bring all the allies together around that? No, because theyve always wanted this to be an American effort. You know, they even had the Defense Department issue a memorandum saying, Dont bother applying for assistance or for being part of the reconstruction if you werent part of our original coalition. Now, thats not a good way to build support and reduce the risk for our troops and make America safer. Im going to get the training done for our troops. Im going to get the training of Iraqis done faster. And Im going to get our allies back to the table.",2004-10-08,Democrat
Bush,"Two days ago in the Oval Office, I met with the finance minister from Iraq. He came to see me. And he talked about how optimistic he was and the country was about heading toward elections. Think about it: Theyre going from tyranny to elections. He talked about the reconstruction efforts that are beginning to take hold. He talked about the fact that Iraqis love to be free. He said he was optimistic when he came here, then he turned on the TV and listened to the political rhetoric and all of a sudden he was pessimistic. Now, this is guy a who, along with others, has taken great risk for great freedom. And we need to stand with him. My opponent says he has a plan; it sounds familiar, because its called the Bush plan. Were going to train troops, and we are. Well have 125,000 trained by the end of December. Were spending about $7 billion. He talks about a grand idea: Lets have a summit; were going to solve the problem in Iraq by holding a summit. And what is he going to say to those people that show up at the summit? Join me in the wrong war at the wrong time at the wrong place. Risk your troops in a war youve called a mistake. Nobody is going to follow somebody who doesnt believe we can succeed and with somebody who says that war where we are is a mistake. I know how these people think. I meet with them all the time. I talk to Tony Blair all the time. I talk to Silvio Berlusconi. Theyre not going to follow an American president who says follow me into a mistake. Our plan is working. Were going to make elections. And Iraq is going to be free, and America will be better off for it.",2004-10-08,Republican
Gibson,"Do you want to follow up, Senator?",2004-10-08,Moderator
Kerry,"Yes, sir, please. Ladies and gentlemen, the right war was Osama bin Laden and Afghanistan. That was the right place. And the right time was Tora Bora, when we had him cornered in the mountains. Now, everyone in the world knows that there were no weapons of mass destruction. That was the reason Congress gave him the authority to use force, not after excuse to get rid of the regime. Now we have to succeed. Ive always said that. I have been consistent. Yes, we have to succeed, and I have a better plan to help us do it.",2004-10-08,Democrat
Bush,"First of all, we didnt find out he didnt have weapons until we got there, and my opponent thought he had weapons and told everybody he thought he had weapons. And secondly, its a fundamental misunderstanding to say that the war on terror is only Osama bin Laden. The war on terror is to make sure that these terrorist organizations do not end up with weapons of mass destruction. Thats what the war on terror is about. Of course, were going to find Osama bin Laden. Weve already 75 percent of his people. And were on the hunt for him. But this is a global conflict that requires firm resolve.",2004-10-08,Republican
Gibson,"The next question is for President Bush, and it comes from Nikki Washington.",2004-10-08,Moderator
Washington,"Thank you. Mr. President, my mother and sister traveled abroad this summer, and when they got back they talked to us about how shocked they were at the intensity of aggravation that other countries had with how we handled the Iraq situation. Diplomacy is obviously something that we really have to really work on.",2004-10-08,Moderator
Bush,"No, I appreciate that. I  listen, I  weve got a great country. I love our values. And I recognize Ive made some decisions that have caused people to not understand the great values of our country. I remember when Ronald Reagan was the president; he stood on principle. Somebody called that stubborn. He stood on principle standing up to the Soviet Union, and we won that conflict. Yet at the same time, he was very  we were very unpopular in Europe because of the decisions he made. I recognize that taking Saddam Hussein out was unpopular. But I made the decision because I thought it was in the right interests of our security. You know, Ive made some decisions on Israel thats unpopular. I wouldnt deal with Arafat, because I felt like he had let the former president down, and I dont think hes the kind of person that can lead toward a Palestinian state. And people in Europe didnt like that decision. And that was unpopular, but it was the right thing to do. I believe Palestinians ought to have a state, but I know they need leadership thats committed to a democracy and freedom, leadership that would be willing to reject terrorism. I made a decision not to join the International Criminal Court in The Hague, which is where our troops could be brought to  brought in front of a judge, an unaccounted judge. I dont think we ought to join that. That was unpopular. And so, what Im telling you is, is that sometimes in this world you make unpopular decisions because you think theyre right. Well continue to reach out. Listen, there is 30 nations involved in Iraq, some 40 nations involved in Afghanistan. People love America. Sometimes they dont like the decisions made by America, but I dont think you want a president who tries to become popular and does the wrong thing. You dont want to join the International Criminal Court just because its popular in certain capitals in Europe.",2004-10-08,Republican
Gibson,"Senator Kerry, a minute and a half.",2004-10-08,Moderator
Kerry,"Nikki, thats a question thats been raised by a lot of people around the country. Let me address it but also talk about the weapons the president just talked about, because every part of the presidents answer just now promises you more of the same over the next four years. And his answer was, With a viable exit strategy and only with enough forces to get the job done. He didnt do that. He broke that promise. We didnt have enough forces. General Shinseki, the Army chief of staff, told him he was going to need several hundred thousand. And guess what? They retired General Shinseki for telling him that. This president hasnt listened. I went to meet with the members of the Security Council in the week before we voted. I went to New York. I talked to all of them to find out how serious they were about really holding Saddam Hussein accountable. I came away convinced that, if we worked at it, if we were ready to work and letting Hans Blix do his job and thoroughly go through the inspections, that if push came to shove, theyd be there with us. But the president just arbitrarily brought the hammer down and said, Nope. Sorry, time for diplomacy is over. Were going. He rushed to war without a plan to win the peace. Ladies and gentleman, he gave you a speech and told you hed plan carefully, take every precaution, take our allies with us. He didnt. He broke his word.",2004-10-08,Democrat

General Shinseki had the wisdom to say, Youre going to need several hundred thousand troops to win the peace. The militarys job is to win the war. A presidents job is to win the peace. The president did not do what was necessary. Didnt bring in enough nation. Didnt deliver the help. Didnt close off the borders. Didnt even guard the ammo dumps. And now our kids are being killed with ammos right out of that dump.",2004-10-08,Democrat

Kerry,Is it Randee?,2004-10-08,Democrat
Jacobs,"Yes, Randee. Iran sponsors terrorism and has missiles capable of hitting Israel and southern Europe. Iran will have nuclear weapons in two to three years time.",2004-10-08,Moderator
Kerry,"I dont think you can just rely on U.N. sanctions, Randee. But youre absolutely correct, it is a threat, its a huge threat. And whats interesting is, its a threat that has grown while the president has been preoccupied with Iraq, where there wasnt a threat. If hed let the inspectors do their job and go on, we wouldnt have 10 times the numbers of forces in Iraq that we have in Afghanistan chasing Osama bin Laden. Meanwhile, while Iran is moving toward nuclear weapons, some 37 tons of what they called yellow cake, the stuff they use to make enriched uranium, while theyre doing that, North Korea has moved from one bomb maybe, maybe, to four to seven bombs. For two years, the president didnt even engage with North Korea, did nothing at all, while it was growing more dangerous, despite the warnings of former Secretary of Defense William Perry, who negotiated getting television cameras and inspectors into that reactor. We were safer before President Bush came to office. Now they have the bombs and were less safe. So what do we do? Weve got to join with the British and the French, with the Germans, whove been involved, in their initiative. Weve got to lead the world now to crack down on proliferation as a whole. But the presidents been slow to do that, even in Russia. At his pace, its going to take 13 years to reduce and get ahold of all the loose nuclear material in the former Soviet Union. Ive proposed a plan that can capture it and contain it and clean it within four years. And the president is moving to the creation of our own bunker- busting nuclear weapon. Its very hard to get other countries to give up their weapons when youre busy developing a new one. Im going to lead the world in the greatest counterproliferation effort. And if we have to get tough with Iran, believe me, we will get tough.",2004-10-08,Democrat
Gibson,"Mr. President, a minute and a half.",2004-10-08,Moderator
Bush,"That answer almost made me want to scowl. He keeps talking about, Let the inspectors do their job. Its naive and dangerous to say that. Thats what the Duelfer report showed. He was deceiving the inspectors. Secondly, of course weve been involved with Iran. I fully understand the threat. And thats why were doing what he suggested we do: Get the Brits, the Germans and the French to go make it very clear to the Iranians that if they expect to be a party to the world to give up their nuclear ambitions. Weve been doing that. Let me talk about North Korea. It is naive and dangerous to take a policy that he suggested the other day, which is to have bilateral relations with North Korea. Remember, hes the person whos accusing me of not acting multilaterally. He now wants to take the six-party talks we have  China, North Korea, South Korea, Russia, Japan and the United States  and undermine them by having bilateral talks. He didnt honor the agreement. He was enriching uranium. That is a bad policy. Of course, were paying attention to these. Its a great question about Iran. Thats why in my speech to the Congress I said: Theres an Axis of Evil, Iraq, Iran and North Korea, and were paying attention to it. And were making progress.",2004-10-08,Republican
Gibson,"Were going to move on, Mr. President, with a question for you. And it comes from Daniel Farley.",2004-10-08,Moderator
Farley,"Mr. President, since we continue to police the world, how do you intend to maintain our military presence without reinstituting a draft?",2004-10-08,Moderator
Bush,"Yes, thats a great question. Thanks. I hear theres rumors on the Internets (sic) that were going to have a draft. Were not going to have a draft, period. The all- volunteer army works. It works particularly when we pay our troops well. It works when we make sure theyve got housing, like we have done in the last military budgets. An all-volunteer army is best suited to fight the new wars of the 21st century, which is to be specialized and to find these people as they hide around the world. We dont need mass armies anymore. One of the things weve done is weve taken the  were beginning to transform our military. And by that I mean were moving troops out of Korea and replacing them with more effective weapons. We dont need as much manpower on the Korean Peninsula to keep a deterrent. In Europe, we have massed troops as if the Soviet Union existed and was going to invade into Europe, but those days are over with. And so were moving troops out of Europe and replacing it with more effective equipment. So to answer your question is, were withdrawing, not from the world, were withdrawing manpower so they can be stationed here in America, so theres less rotation, so life is easier on their families and therefore more likely to be  well be more likely to be able to keep people in the all-volunteer army. One of the more important things were doing in this administration is transformation. There are some really interesting technologies. For instance, were flying unmanned vehicles that can send real- time messages back to stations in the United States. That saves manpower, and it saves equipment. It also means that we can target things easier and move more quickly, which means we need to be lighter and quicker and more facile and highly trained. Now, forget all this talk about a draft. Were not going to have a draft so long as I am the president.",2004-10-08,Republican
Gibson,"Senator Kerry, a minute and a half.",2004-10-08,Moderator
Kerry,"Daniel, I dont support a draft. But let me tell you where the presidents policies have put us. The president  and this is one of the reasons why I am very proud in this race to have the support of General John Shalikashvili, former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; Admiral William Crowe, former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; General Tony McPeak, who ran the air war for the presidents father and did a brilliant job, supporting me; General Wes Clark, who won the war in Kosovo, supporting me; because they all  and General Baca, who was the head of the National Guard, supporting me. Why? Because they understand that our military is overextended under the president. Our Guard and reserves have been turned into almost active duty. Youve got people doing two and three rotations. Youve got stop-loss policies, so people cant get out when they were supposed to. Youve got a back-door draft right now. And a lot of our military are underpaid. These are families that get hurt. It hurts the middle class. It hurts communities, because these are our first responders. And theyre called up. And theyre over there, not over here. Now, Im going to add 40,000 active duty forces to the military, and Im going to make people feel good about being safe in our military, and not overextended, because Im going to run a foreign policy that actually does what President Reagan did, President Eisenhower did, and others.

Kerry,"Thank you very much, Ann. Ive asked in my security briefings why that is, and I cant go into all the answers, et cetera, but let me say this to you. This president and his administration have told you and all of us its not a question of when, its a question of  excuse me  not a question of if, its a question of when. Weve been told that. The when I cant tell you. Between the World Trade Center bombing in, what was it, 1993 or so, and the next time was five years, seven years. These people wait. Theyll plan. They plot. I agree with the president that we have to go after them and get them wherever they are. I just think I can do that far more effectively, because the most important weapon in doing that is intelligence. Youve got to have the best intelligence in the world. And in order to have the best intelligence in the world to know who the terrorists are and where they are and what theyre plotting, youve got to have the best cooperation youve ever had in the world. Now, to go back to your question, Nikki, were not getting the best cooperation in the world today. Weve got a whole bunch of countries that pay a price for dealing with the United States of America now. Im going to change that. And Im going to put in place a better homeland security effort. This president in the last debate said, Well, that would be a big tax gap if we did that. Ladies and gentlemen, its his tax plan. He chose a tax cut for the wealthiest Americans over getting that equipment out into the homeland as fast as possible. We have bridges and tunnels that arent being secured, chemical plants, nuclear plants that arent secured, hospitals that are overcrowded with their emergency rooms. This president chose a tax cut over homeland security. Wrong choice.",2004-10-08,Democrat
Gibson,Mr. President?,2004-10-08,Moderator
Bush,"Thats an odd thing to say, since weve tripled the homeland security budget from $10 billion to $30 billion. Listen, well do everything we can to protect the homeland. My opponents right, we need good intelligence. Its also a curious thing for him to say since right after 1993 he voted to cut the intelligence budget by $7.5 billion. The best way to defend America in this world we live in is to stay on the offense. We got to be right 100 percent of the time here at home, and they got to be right once. And thats the reality. And theres a lot of good people working hard. Were doing the best we possibly can to share information. Thats why the Patriot Act was important. The Patriot Act is vital, by the way. Its a tool that law enforcement now uses to be able to talk between each other. My opponent says he hadnt changed his position on it. No, but hes for weakening it. I dont think my opponent has got the right view about the world to make us safe; I really dont. First of all, I dont think he can succeed in Iraq. And if Iraq were to fail, itd be a haven for terrorists, and there would be money and the world would be much more dangerous. I dont see how you can win in Iraq if you dont believe we should be there in the first place. I dont see how you can lead troops if you say its the wrong war at the wrong place at the wrong time. I dont see how the Iraqis are going to have confidence in the American president if all they hear is that it was a mistake to be there in the first place. This war is a long, long war, and it requires steadfast determination and it requires a complete understanding that we not only chase down Al Qaida but we disrupt terrorist safe havens as well as people who could provide the terrorists with support.",2004-10-08,Republican

Kerry,"Well, the president and his experts have told America that its not a question of if; its a question of when. And I accept what the president has said. These terrorists are serious, theyre deadly, and they know nothing except trying to kill. I understand that. Thats why I will never stop at anything to hunt down and kill the terrorists. But you heard the president just say to you that weve added money. Folks, the test is not if youve added money; the test is that youve done everything possible to make America secure.

Horstman,"Mr. President, why did you block the reimportation of safer and inexpensive drugs from Canada which would have cut 40 to 60 percent off of the cost?",2004-10-08,Moderator
Bush,"I havent yet. Just want to make sure theyre safe. When a drug comes in from Canada, I want to make sure it cures you and doesnt kill you. And thats why the FDA and thats why the surgeon general are looking very carefully to make sure it can be done in a safe way. Ive got an obligation to make sure our government does everything we can to protect you. And what my worry is is that, you know, it looks like its from Canada, and it might be from a third world. And weve just got to make sure, before somebody thinks theyre buying a product, that it works. And thats why were doing what were doing. Now, it may very well be here in December youll hear me say, I think theres a safe way to do it. There are other ways to make sure drugs are cheaper. One is to speed up generic drugs to the marketplace, quicker. Pharmaceuticals were using loopholes to keep brand  brand drugs in place, and generics are much less expensive than brand drugs. And were doing just that. Another is to pass  to get our seniors to sign up to these drug discount cards, and theyre working. Wanda Blackmore I met here from Missouri, the first time she bought drugs with her drug discount card, she paid $1.14, I think it was, for about $10 worth of drugs. These cards make sense. And, you know, in 2006 seniors are going to get prescription drug coverage for the first time in Medicare. Because I went to Washington to fix problems. Medicare  the issue of Medicare used to be called Mediscare. People didnt want to touch it for fear of getting hurt politically. I wanted to get something done. I think our seniors deserve a modern medical system. And in 2006, our seniors will get prescription drug coverage. Thank you for asking.",2004-10-08,Republican

Four years ago, right here in this forum, he was asked the same question: Cant people be able to import drugs from Canada? You know what he said? I think that makes sense. I think thats a good idea  four years ago. Now, the president said, Im not blocking that. Ladies and gentlemen, the president just didnt level with you right now again. He did block it, because we passed it in the United States Senate. We sent it over to the House, that you could import drugs. We took care of the safety issues. Were not talking about third-world drugs. Were talking about drugs made right here in the United States of America that have American brand names on them and American bottles. And were asking to be able to allow you to get them. The president blocked it. The president also took Medicare, which belongs to you. And he could have lowered the cost of Medicare and lowered your taxes and lowered the costs to seniors. You know what he did? He made it illegal, illegal for Medicare to do what the V.A. does, which is bulk purchase drugs so that you can lower the price and get them out to you lower. He put $139 billion of windfall profit into the pockets of the drug companies right out of your pockets. Thats the difference between us. The president sides with the power companies, the oil companies, the drug companies. And Im fighting to let you get those drugs from Canada, and Im fighting to let Medicare survive. Im fighting for the middle class. That is the difference.",2004-10-08,Democrat

Laurent,"Senator Kerry, youve stated your concern for the rising cost of health care, yet you chose a vice presidential candidate who has made millions of dollars successfully suing medical professionals. How do you reconcile this with the voters?",2004-10-08,Moderator
Kerry,"Very easily. John Edwards is the author of the Patients Bill of Rights. He wanted to give people rights. John Edwards and I support tort reform. We both believe that, as lawyers  Im a lawyer, too. And I believe that we will be able to get a fix that has alluded everybody else because we know how to do it. Its in my health-care proposal. Go to johnkerry.com. You can pull it off of the Internet. And youll find a tort reform plan. Now, ladies and gentlemen, important to understand, the president and his friends try to make a big deal out of it. Is it a problem? Yes, its a problem. Do we need to fix it, particularly for OGBYNs (sic) and for brain surgeons and others? Yes. But its less than 1 percent of the total cost of health care. Your premiums are going up. Youve gone up, in Missouri, about $3,500. Youve gone up 64 percent. Youve seen co-pays go up, deductibles go up. Everythings gone up. Five million people have lost their health insurance under this president. Hes done nothing about it. I have a plan. I have a plan to lower the cost of health care for you. I have a plan to cover all children. I have a plan to let you buy into the same health care senators and congressmen give themselves. I have a plan thats going to allow people 55 to 64 to buy into Medicare early. And I have a plan that will take the catastrophic cases out of the system, off your backs, pay for it out of a federal fund, which lowers the premiums for everybody in America, makes American business more competitive and makes health care more affordable. Now, all of that can happen, but I have to ask you to do one thing: Join me in rolling back the presidents unaffordable tax cut for people earning more than $200,000 a year. Thats all. Ninety-eight percent of America, Im giving you a tax cut and Im giving you health care.",2004-10-08,Democrat

Bush,"Let me see where to start here. First, the National Journal named Senator Kennedy the most liberal senator of all. And thats saying something in that bunch. You might say that took a lot of hard work. The reason I bring that up is because hes proposed $2.2 trillion in new spending, and he says he going to tax the rich to close the tax gap. He cant. Hes going to tax everybody here to fund his programs. Thats just reality. And what are his health programs? First, he says hes for medical liability reform, particularly for OB/GYNs. Theres a bill on the floor of the United States Senate that he could have showed up and voted for if hes so much for it. Secondly, he says that medical liability costs only cause a 1 percent increase. That shows a lack of understanding. Doctors practice defensive medicine because of all the frivolous lawsuits that cost our government $28 billion a year. And finally, he said hes going to have a novel health care plan. You know what it is? The federal government is going to run it. Its the largest increase in federal government health care ever. And it fits with his philosophy. Thats why I told you about the award he won from the National Journal. Thats what liberals do. They create government-sponsored health care. Maybe you think that makes sense. I dont. Government-sponsored health care would lead to rationing. It would ruin the quality of health care in America.",2004-10-08,Republican

Obrien,"Mr. President, you have enjoyed a Republican majority in the House and Senate for most of your presidency. In that time, youve not vetoed a single spending bill. Excluding $120 billion spent in Iran and  Im sorry, Iraq and Afghanistan, there has been $700 billion spent and not paid for by taxes. Please explain how the spending you have approved and not paid for is better for the American people than the spending proposed by your opponent.",2004-10-08,Moderator
Bush,"Right, thank you for that. We have a deficit. We have a deficit because this country went into a recession. You might remember the stock market started to decline dramatically six months before I came to office, and then the bubble of the 1990s popped. And that cost us revenue. That cost us revenue. Secondly, were at war. And Im going to spend what it takes to win the war, more than just $120 billion for Iraq and Afghanistan. Weve got to pay our troops more. We have. Weve increased money for ammunition and weapons and pay and homeland security. I just told this lady over here we spent  went from $10 billion to $30 billion to protect the homeland. I think we have an obligation to spend that kind of money. And plus, we cut taxes for everybody. Everybody got tax relief, so that they get out of the recession. I think if you raise taxes during a recession, you head to depression. I come from the school of thought that says when people have more money in their pocket during economic times, it increases demand or investment. Small businesses begin to grow, and jobs are added. We found out today that over the past 13 months, weve added 1.9 million new jobs in the last 13 months. I proposed a plan, detailed budget, that shows us cutting the deficit in half by five years. And youre right, I havent vetoed any spending bills, because we work together. Non-homeland, non-defense discretionary spending was raising at 15 percent a year when I got into office. And today its less than 1 percent, because were working together to try to bring this deficit under control. Like you, Im concerned about the deficit. But I am not going to shortchange our troops in harms way. And Im not going to run up taxes, which will cost this economy jobs. Thank you for your question.",2004-10-08,Republican

The government has nothing to do with it. In fact, it doesnt ask you to do anything  if you dont want to take it, you dont have to. If you like your high premiums, you keep them. Thats the way we leave it. Now with respect to the deficit, the president was handed a $5.6 trillion surplus, ladies and gentlemen. Thats where he was when he came into office. We now have a $2.6 trillion deficit. This is the biggest turnaround in the history of the country. Hes the first president in 72 years to lose jobs. He talked about war. This is the first time the United States of America has ever had a tax cut when were at war. Franklin Roosevelt, Harry Truman, others, knew how to lead. They knew how to ask the American people for the right things. One percent of America, the highest one percent of income earners in America, got $89 billion of tax cut last year. One percent of America got more than the 80 percent of America that earned from $100,000 down. The president thinks its more important to fight for that top 1 percent than to fight for fiscal responsibility and to fight for you. I want to put money in your pocket. I am  I have a proposal for a tax cut for all people earning less than the $200,000. The only people affected by my plan are the top income earners of America.",2004-10-08,Democrat

I have a $4,000 tuition tax credit that goes to parents  and kids, if theyre earning for themselves  to be able to pay for college. And I lower the cost of health care in the way that I described to you. Every part of my program Ive shown how Im going to pay for it. And Ive gotten good people, like former Secretary of the Treasury Bob Rubin, for instance, who showed how to balance budgets and give you a good economy, to help me crunch these numbers and make them work. Ive even scaled back some of my favorite programs already, like the child-care program I wanted to fund and the national service program, because the presidents deficit keeps growing and Ive said as a pledge, Im going to cut the deficit in half in four years. Now, Im going to restore what we did in the 1990s, ladies and gentlemen: pay as you go. Were going to do it like you do it. The president broke the pay-as-you-go rule. I think John McCain called the energy bill the No Lobbyist Left Behind bill. I mean, youve got to stand up and fight somewhere, folks. Im pledging I will not raise taxes; Im giving a tax cut to the people earning less than $200,000 a year.

I proposed to the United States Congress a Clear Skies Initiative to reduce sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide and mercury by 70 percent. I have  was fought for a very strong title in the farm bill for the conservation reserve program to set aside millions of acres of land to help improve wildlife and the habitat. We proposed and passed a healthy forest bill which was essential to working with  particularly in Western states  to make sure that our forests were protected. What happens in those forests, because of lousy federal policy, is they grow to be  they are not  theyre not harvested. Theyre not taken care of. And as a result, theyre like tinderboxes. And over the last summers Ive flown over there. And so, this is a reasonable policy to protect old stands of trees and at the same time make sure our forests arent vulnerable to the forest fires that have destroyed acres after acres in the West. Weve got a good, common-sense policy. Now, Im going to tell you what I really think is going to happen over time is technology is going to change the way we live for the good for the environment. Thats why I proposed a hydrogen automobile  hydrogen-generated automobile. Were spending $1 billion to come up with the technologies to do that. Thats why Im a big proponent of clean coal technology, to make sure we can use coal but in a clean way. I guess youd say Im a good steward of the land.

Barrow,"Senator Kerry, how can the U.S. be competitive in manufacturing given  in manufacturing, excuse me  given the wage necessary and comfortably accepted for American workers to maintain the standard of living that they expect?",2004-10-08,Moderator
Kerry,"Jane, there are a lot of ways to be competitive. And unfortunately again I regret this administration has not seized them and embraced them. Let me give you an example. There is a tax loophole right now. If youre a company in St. Louis working, trying to make jobs here, there is actually an incentive for you to go away. You get more money, you keep more of your taxes by going abroad. Im going to shut that loophole, and Im going to give the tax benefit to the companies that stay here in America to help make them more competitive. Secondly, were going to create a manufacturing jobs credit and a new jobs credit for people to be able to help hire and be more competitive here in America. Third, whats really hurting American business more than anything else is the cost of health care. Now, you didnt hear any plan from the president, because he doesnt have a plan to lower the cost of health care. Five million Americans have lost their health care; 620,000 Missourians have no health care at all; 96,000 Missourians have lost their health care under President Bush. I have a plan to cover those folks. And its a plan that lowers cost for everybody, covers all children. And the way I pay for it  Im not fiscally irresponsible  is I roll back the tax cut this president so fiercely wants to defend, the one for him and me and Charlie. I think you ought to get the break. I want to lower your cost to health care. I want to fully fund education, No Child Left Behind, special-needs education. And thats how were going to be more competitive, by making sure our kids are graduating from school and college. China and India are graduating more graduates in technology and science than we are. Weve got to create the products of the future. Thats why I have a plan for energy independence within 10 years. And were going to put our laboratories and our colleges and our universities to work. And were going to get the great entrepreneurial spirit of this country, and were going to free ourselves from this dependency on Mideast oil. Thats how you create jobs and become competitive.",2004-10-08,Democrat
Gibson,"Mr. President, minute and a half.",2004-10-08,Moderator
Bush,"Let me start with how to control the cost of health care: medical liability reform, for starters, which hes opposed. Secondly, allow small businesses to pool together so they can share risk and buy insurance at the same discounts big businesses get to do. Thirdly, spread whats called health savings accounts. Its good for small businesses, good for owners. You own your own account. You can save tax-free. You get a catastrophic plan to help you on it. This is different from saying, OK, let me incent you to go on the government. Hes talking about his plan to keep jobs here. You know he calls it an outsourcing to keep  stop outsourcing. Robert Rubin looked at his plan and said it wont work. The best way to keep jobs here in America is, one, have an energy plan. I proposed one to the Congress two years ago, encourages conservation, encourages technology to explore for environmentally friendly ways for coal  to use coal and gas. It encourages the use of renewables like ethanol and biodiesel. Its stuck in the Senate. He and his running-mate didnt show up to vote when they could have got it going in the Senate. Less regulations if we want jobs here; legal reform if we want jobs here; and weve got to keep taxes low. Now, he says hes only going to tax the rich. Do you realize, 900,000 small businesses will be taxed under his plan because most small businesses are Subchapter S corps or limited partnerships, and they pay tax at the individual income tax level. And so when youre running up the taxes like that, youre taxing job creators, and thats not how you keep jobs here.",2004-10-08,Republican
Gibson,"Senator, I want to extend for a minute, you talk about tax credits to stop outsourcing. But when you have IBM documents that I saw recently where you can hire a programmer for $12 in China, $56 an hour here, tax credits wont cut it.",2004-10-08,Moderator
Kerry,"You cant stop all outsourcing, Charlie. Ive never promised that. Im not going to, because that would be pandering. You cant. But what you can do is create a fair playing field, and thats what Im talking about. But let me just address what the president just said. Ladies and gentlemen, thats just not true what he said. The Wall Street Journal said 96 percent of small businesses are not affected at all by my plan. And you know why he gets that count? The president got $84 from a timber company that owns, and hes counted as a small business. Dick Cheneys counted as a small business. Thats how they do things. Thats just not right.",2004-10-08,Democrat
Bush,"I own a timber company? Thats news to me. Most small businesses are Subchapter S corps. They just are. I met Grant Milliron, Mansfield, Ohio. Hes creating jobs. Most small businesses  70 percent of the new jobs in America are created by small businesses. Taxes are going up when you run up the top two brackets. Its a fact.",2004-10-08,Republican
Gibson,"President Bush, the next question is for you, and it comes from Rob Fowler, who I believe is over in this area.",2004-10-08,Moderator
Fowler,"President Bush, 45 days after 9/11, Congress passed the Patriot Act, which takes away checks on law enforcement and weakens American citizens rights and freedoms, especially Fourth Amendment rights.",2004-10-08,Moderator
Bush,"I appreciate that. I really dont think your rights are being watered down. As a matter of fact, I wouldnt support it if I thought that. Every action being taken against terrorists requires court order, requires scrutiny. As a matter of fact, the tools now given to the terrorist fighters are the same tools that weve been using against drug dealers and white-collar criminals. So I really dont think so. I hope you dont think that. I mean, I  because I think whoever is the president must guard your liberties, must not erode your rights in America. The Patriot Act is necessary, for example, because parts of the FBI couldnt talk to each other. The intelligence-gathering and the law-enforcement arms of the FBI just couldnt share intelligence under the old law. And that didnt make any sense. Our law enforcement must have every tool necessary to find and disrupt terrorists at home and abroad before they hurt us again. Thats the task of the 21st century. And so, I dont think the Patriot Act abridges your rights at all. And I know its necessary. I can remember being in upstate New York talking to FBI agents that helped bust a Lackawanna cell up there. And they told me they could not have performed their duty, the duty we all expect of them, if they did not have the ability to communicate with each other under the Patriot Act.",2004-10-08,Republican
Gibson,"Senator Kerry, a minute and a half.",2004-10-08,Moderator
Kerry,"Former Governor Racicot, as chairman of the Republican Party, said he thought that the Patriot Act has to be changed and fixed. Congressman Jim Sensenbrenner, he is the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, said over his dead body before it gets renewed without being thoroughly rechecked. A whole bunch of folks in America are concerned about the way the Patriot Act has been applied. In fact, the inspector general of the Justice Department found that John Ashcroft had twice applied it in ways that were inappropriate. Peoples rights have been abused. I met a man who spent eight months in prison, wasnt even allowed to call his lawyer, wasnt allowed to get  finally, Senator Dick Durbin of Illinois intervened and was able to get him out. This is in our country, folks, the United States of America. Theyve got sneak-and-peek searches that are allowed. Theyve got people allowed to go into churches now and political meetings without any showing of potential criminal activity or otherwise. Now, I voted for the Patriot Act. Ninety-nine United States senators voted for it. And the presidents been very busy running around the country using what I just described to you as a reason to say Im wishy-washy, that Im a flip-flopper. Now thats not a flip-flop. I believe in the Patriot Act. We need the things in it that coordinate the FBI and the CIA. We need to be stronger on terrorism. But you know what we also need to do as Americans is never let the terrorists change the Constitution of the United States in a way that disadvantages our rights.",2004-10-08,Democrat

Long,"Senator Kerry, thousands of people have already been cured or treated by the use of adult stem cells or umbilical cord stem cells. However, no one has been cured by using embryonic stem cells.",2004-10-08,Moderator
Kerry,"You know, Elizabeth, I really respect your  the feeling thats in your question. I understand it. I know the morality thats prompting that question, and I respect it enormously. But like Nancy Reagan, and so many other people  you know, I was at a forum with Michael J. Fox the other day in New Hampshire, whos suffering from Parkinsons, and he wants us to do stem cell, embryonic stem cell. And this fellow stood up, and he was quivering. His whole body was shaking from the nerve disease, the muscular disease that he had. And he said to me and to the whole hall, he said, You know, dont take away my hope, because my hope is what keeps me going. Chris Reeve is a friend of mine. Chris Reeve exercises every single day to keep those muscles alive for the day when he believes he can walk again, and I want him to walk again. I think we can save lives. Now, I think we can do ethically guided embryonic stem-cell research. We have 100,000 to 200,000 embryos that are frozen in nitrogen today from fertility clinics. These werent taken from abortion or something like that. Theyre from a fertility clinic. And theyre either going to be destroyed or left frozen. And I believe if we have the option, which scientists tell us we do, of curing Parkinsons, curing diabetes, curing, you know, some kind of a, you know, paraplegic or quadriplegic or, you know, a spinal cord injury, anything, thats the nature of the human spirit. I think it is respecting life to reach for that cure. I think it is respecting life to do it in an ethical way. And the president has chosen a policy that makes it impossible for our scientists to do that. I want the future, and I think we have to grab it.",2004-10-08,Democrat
Gibson,"Mr. President, a minute and a half.",2004-10-08,Moderator

I did to because I too hope that well discover cures from the stem cells and from the research derived. But I think weve got to be very careful in balancing the ethics and the science. And so I made the decision we wouldnt spend any more money beyond the 70 lines, 22 of which are now in action, because science is important, but so is ethics, so is balancing life. To destroy life to save life is  its one of the real ethical dilemmas that we face. There is going to be hundreds of experiments off the 22 lines that now exist that are active, and hopefully we find a cure. But as well, we need to continue to pursue adult stem-cell research. I helped double the NIH budget to $28 billion a year to find cures. And the approach I took is one that I think is a balanced and necessary approach, to balance science and the concerns for life.",2004-10-08,Republican

I dont know how you draw that line. But let me tell you, point blank, the lines of stem cells that hes made available, every scientist in the country will tell you, Not adequate, because theyre contaminated by mouse cells, and because there arent 60 or 70  theyre are only about 11 to 20 now  and there arent enough to be able to do the research because theyre contaminated.

I would pick somebody who would not allow their personal opinion to get in the way of the law. I would pick somebody who would strictly interpret the Constitution of the United States. Let me give you a couple of examples, I guess, of the kind of person I wouldnt pick. I wouldnt pick a judge who said that the Pledge of Allegiance couldnt be said in a school because it had the words under God in it. I think thats an example of a judge allowing personal opinion to enter into the decision-making process as opposed to a strict interpretation of the Constitution. Another example would be the Dred Scott case, which is where judges, years ago, said that the Constitution allowed slavery because of personal property rights. Thats a personal opinion. Thats not what the Constitution says. The Constitution of the United States says were all  you know, it doesnt say that. It doesnt speak to the equality of America. And so, I would pick people that would be strict constructionists. Weve got plenty of lawmakers in Washington, D.C. Legislators make law; judges interpret the Constitution. And I suspect one of us will have a pick at the end of next year  the next four years. And thats the kind of judge Im going to put on there.

And he said also that his two favorite justices are Justice Scalia and Justice Thomas. So you get a pretty good sense of where hes heading if he were to appoint somebody. Now, heres what I believe. I dont believe we need a good conservative judge, and I dont believe we need a good liberal judge. I dont believe we need a good judge of that kind of definition on either side. I subscribe to the Justice Potter Stewart standard. He was a justice on the Supreme Court of the United States. And he said the mark of a good judge, good justice, is that when youre reading their decision, their opinion, you cant tell if its written by a man or woman, a liberal or a conservative, a Muslim, a Jew or a Christian. You just know youre reading a good judicial decision. What I want to find, if I am privileged to have the opportunity to do it  and the Supreme Court of the United States is at stake in this race, ladies and gentlemen.

Degenhart,"Senator Kerry, suppose you are speaking with a voter who believed abortion is murder and the voter asked for reassurance that his or her tax dollars would not go to support abortion, what would you say to that person?",2004-10-08,Moderator
Kerry,"I would say to that person exactly what I will say to you right now. First of all, I cannot tell you how deeply I respect the belief about life and when it begins. Im a Catholic, raised a Catholic. I was an altar boy. Religion has been a huge part of my life. It helped lead me through a war, leads me today. But I cant take what is an article of faith for me and legislate it for someone who doesnt share that article of faith, whether they be agnostic, atheist, Jew, Protestant, whatever. I cant do that. But I can counsel people. I can talk reasonably about life and about responsibility. I can talk to people, as my wife Teresa does, about making other choices, and about abstinence, and about all these other things that we ought to do as a responsible society. But as a president, I have to represent all the people in the nation. And I have to make that judgment. Now, I believe that you can take that position and not be pro- abortion, but you have to afford people their constitutional rights. And that means being smart about allowing people to be fully educated, to know what their options are in life, and making certain that you dont deny a poor person the right to be able to have whatever the constitution affords them if they cant afford it otherwise. Thats why I think its important. Thats why I think its important for the United States, for instance, not to have this rigid ideological restriction on helping families around the world to be able to make a smart decision about family planning. Youll help prevent AIDS. Youll help prevent unwanted children, unwanted pregnancies. Youll actually do a better job, I think, of passing on the moral responsibility that is expressed in your question. And I truly respect it.",2004-10-08,Democrat
Gibson,"Mr. President, minute and a half.",2004-10-08,Moderator
Bush,"Im trying to decipher that. My answer is, were not going to spend taxpayers money on abortion. This is an issue that divides America, but certainly reasonable people can agree on how to reduce abortions in America. I signed the partial-birth  the ban on partial-birth abortion. Its a brutal practice. Its one way to help reduce abortions. My opponent voted against the ban. I think there ought to be parental notification laws. Hes against them. I signed a bill called the Unborn Victims of Violence Act. In other words, if youre a mom and youre pregnant and you get killed, the murderer gets tried for two cases, not just one. My opponent was against that. These are reasonable ways to help promote a culture of life in America. I think it is a worthy goal in America to have every child protected by law and welcomed in life. I also think we ought to continue to have good adoption law as an alternative to abortion. And we need to promote maternity group homes, which my administration has done. Culture of life is really important for a country to have if its going to be a hospitable society. Thank you.",2004-10-08,Republican
Gibson,"Senator, do you want to follow up? Thirty seconds.",2004-10-08,Moderator
Kerry,"Well, again, the president just said, categorically, my opponent is against this, my opponent is against that. You know, its just not that simple. No, Im not. Im against the partial-birth abortion, but youve got to have an exception for the life of the mother and the health of the mother under the strictest test of bodily injury to the mother. Secondly, with respect to parental notification, Im not going to require a 16-or 17-year-old kid whos been raped by her father and whos pregnant to have to notify her father. So you got to have a judicial intervention. And because they didnt have a judicial intervention where she could go somewhere and get help, I voted against it.

But on the big questions, about whether or not we should have gone into Afghanistan, the big question about whether we should have removed somebody in Iraq, Ill stand by those decisions, because I think theyre right. Thats really what youre  when they ask about the mistakes, thats what theyre talking about. Theyre trying to say, Did you make a mistake going into Iraq? And the answer is, Absolutely not. It was the right decision. The Duelfer report confirmed that decision today, because what Saddam Hussein was doing was trying to get rid of sanctions so he could reconstitute a weapons program. And the biggest threat facing America is terrorists with weapons of mass destruction. We knew he hated us. We knew hed been  invaded other countries. We knew he tortured his own people. On the tax cut, its a big decision. I did the right decision. Our recession was one of the shallowest in modern history. Now, you asked what mistakes.

But we have a very different view about how to make America stronger and safer. I will never cede the authority of our country or our security to any other nation. Ill never give a veto over American security to any other entity  not a nation, not a country, not an institution. But I know, as I think you do, that our country is strongest when we lead the world, when we lead strong alliances. And thats the way Eisenhower and Reagan and Kennedy and others did it. We are not doing that today. We need to. I have a plan that will help us go out and kill and find the terrorists. And I will not stop in our efforts to hunt down and kill the terrorists. But Ill also have a better plan of how were going to deal with Iraq: training the Iraqi forces more rapidly, getting our allies back to the table with a fresh start, with new credibility, with a president whose judgment the rest of the world trusts. In addition to that, I believe we have a crisis here at home, a crisis of the middle class that is increasingly squeezed, health-care costs going up. I have a plan to provide health care to all Americans. I have a plan to provide for our schools so we keep the standards but we help our teachers teach and elevate our schools by funding No Child Left Behind. I have a plan to protect the environment so that we leave this place in better shape to our children than we were handed it by our parents. Thats the test. I believe Americas best days are ahead of us. Im an optimist, but we have to make the right choices, to be fiscally responsible and to create the new jobs of the future. We can do this.

Weve been through a lot together as a country  been through a recession, corporate scandals, war. And yet think about where we are: Added 1.9 million new jobs over the past 13 months. The farm income in America is high. Small businesses are flourishing. Homeownership rate is at an all-time high in America. Were on the move. Tonight I had a chance to discuss with you what to do to keep this economy going: keep the taxes low, dont increase the scope of the federal government, keep regulations down, legal reform, a health- care policy that does not empower the federal government but empowers individuals, and an energy plan that will help us become less dependent on foreign sources of energy. And abroad, were at war. And it requires a president who is steadfast and strong and determined. I vowed to the American people after that fateful day of September the 11th that we would not rest nor tire until were safe. The 9/11 Commission put out a report that said America is safer but not yet safe. There is more work to be done. Well stay on the hunt on Al Qaida. Well deny sanctuary to these terrorists. Well make sure they do not end up with weapons of mass destruction. Its the great nexus. The great threat to our country is that these haters end up with weapons of mass destruction. But our long-term security depends on our deep faith in liberty. And well continue to promote freedom around the world. Freedom is on the march. Tomorrow, Afghanistan will be voting for a president.

What is there about these times that drives or draws so many Americans to use drugs?",1988-09-25,Moderator
Bush,"I think weve seen a deterioration of values. I think for a while as a nation we condoned those things we should have condemned. For a while, as I recall, it even seems to me that there was talk of legalizing or decriminalizing marijuana and other drugs, and I think thats all wrong. So weve seen a deterioration in values, and one of the things that I think we should do about it in terms of cause is to instill values into the young people in our schools. We got away, we got into this feeling that value- free education was the thing. And I dont believe that at all I do believe there are fundamental rights and wrongs as far as use. And, of course, as far as the how we make it better, yes, we can do better on interdiction. But weve got to do a lot better on education, and we have to do, be tougher on those who commit crimes. Weve got to get after the users more. We have to change this whole culture. You know, I saw a movie  Crocodile Dundee. And I saw the cocaine scene treated with humor, as though this was a humorous little incident. And its bad. Everybody ought to be in this thing.

I guess the question I would ask of Mr. Bush is how we instill those values, how we create this environment for the drug free schools that we want in this country.

Bush,"Well, the other day my opponent was given a briefing by the CIA. I asked for and received the same briefing. I am very careful in public life about dealing with classified information. And what Im about to say is unclassified. Seven administrations were dealing with Mr. Noriega. It was the Reagan-Bush administration that brought this man to justice. And as the governor of Massachusetts knows, there was no evidence that governor  that Mr. Noriega was involved in drugs, no hard evidence until we indicted him. And so I think its about time we get this Noriega matter in perspective. Panama is a friendly country. I went down there and talked to the president of Panama about cleaning up their money laundering, and Mr. Noriega was there, but there was no evidence at that time, and when the evidence was there, we indicted him. And we want to bring him to justice. And so call off all those pickets out there that are trying to tear down seven different administrations.",1988-09-25,Republican
Lehrer,"All right, the next question will be asked by John Mashek. It goes to Governor Dukakis, and youll have two minutes to answer.",1988-09-25,Moderator
Mashek,"Governor Dukakis, another troublesome issue for voters this year is the bulging federal deficit. In a Dukakis administration, you say taxes will be raised only as a last resort. Would you identify for us then please three specific programs that you are willing to cut to bring that deficit down?",1988-09-25,Moderator
Dukakis,"Yes, Ive been very specific about those, John. And let me lay out for you my own strategy for bring that deficit down, because as a chief executive thats balanced ten budgets in a row, Ive had to make those tough decisions and those tough choices. First, Ive suggested that there are certain weapons systems which we dont need and we cant afford. Mr. Bush has been critical of me for that, but I think those are the kinds of tough choices you have to make. Ive also suggested that there are weapons systems that we should proceed on, and Ive outlined those in detail. Secondly, weve got to invest in economic growth in this country, in every part of this country. Building that kind of growth expands revenues and helps to bring down that deficit. Thirdly, we have to bring interest rates down, and we will as we come up with a good, solid plan with the Congress for bringing that deficit down. And, finally, weve got to go out there and collect billions and billions of dollars in taxes owed that arent being paid to this country. Its very unfair to the average taxpayer who pays his taxes and pays them on time to permit these monies to go uncollected. Ive also suggested that on the domestic side there are areas where we can make some cuts. We ought to be able to come up with an agricultural policy in this country that gives our farm families a fair price and a decent future without spending $20-25 billion a year, which is what weve been doing under this administration. We can help people to live better lives, and at the same time save money by helping hundreds of thousands of families on welfare to get off or welfare, and to become productive citizens again. The thing I dont understand about Mr. Bushs approach to this is how he could possibly be serious about bringing that deficit down given what he says he wants to do. He seems to want to spend a great deal of money on just about every weapon system; he says hes against new taxes, although hes broken that pledge at least times in the last year that I know of; he wants to give the wealthiest taxpayers in this country a five year, $40 billion tax break. He also wants to spend a lot of money on additional programs. If he keeps this up, hes going to be the Joe Isuzu of American politics.",1988-09-25,Democrat

Lehrer,You have a minute to rebut.,1988-09-25,Moderator
Bush,Is this the time to unleash our one-liners? That answer was about as clear as Boston harbor.,1988-09-25,Republican
Bush,"Let me help the governor. There are so many things there, I dont quite know where to begin. When you cut capital gains, you put people to work. John Kennedy proposed cutting capital gains. Paul Tsongas, a liberal senator from Massachusetts said the dumbest thing I did was to oppose the capital gains cut. Its not going to cost the government money. Its going to increase revenues to the federal government, and its going to create jobs. So thats one of the things that I think makes a big difference between us. Massachusetts doesnt have an enormous defense budget, but nevertheless, the governor raised taxes five different times. That happens to be a fact. And so lets kind of stay on the issue, and I have made a specific proposal for what I call a flexible freeze. And it permits  economists on the East Coast and West think its good  it permits the president to sort out the priorities, and we continue to grow because I will not raise taxes.",1988-09-25,Republican
Lehrer,"Your time is up, too. A follow-up, John.",1988-09-25,Moderator
Mashek,"Mr. Vice President, you have vowed not to raise taxes of any kind during your administration and at the same time youve proposed this capital gains cut, youve proposed more incentive breaks for the oil industry. Youve suggested new spending programs and even some Republicans say the flexible freeze you just spoke about will hardly make a dent in the deficit. Is the deficit no longer really a concern of yours, the Republican Party or the taxpayers?",1988-09-25,Moderator
Bush,"I think its the Republican Party and my concern to bring it down. And presidential leadership that I want to provide in this area will bring it down, but weve got to get the Democrats  Congress under control. They do all the spending, they appropriate every dime and tell us how to spend every dime. Id like to ask the Governor to join in getting for the president what 43 governors have, the line-item veto. He has to operate in Massachusetts under a balanced budget proviso. I would like a balanced budget amendment. But the dynamics of the economy  we cut the taxes and revenues are up by 25 percent in three years. So the problem is  its not that the working is being taxed too little or the person working out  the woman working in some factory being taxed too little. It is that we are continuing to spend too much. So, my formula says grow at the rate of inflation. Permit the president to set the priorities on where we do the spending. And remember the Federal deficit has come down $70 billion in one year, in 1987. And if we  and the  actually this year Congress is doing a little better in controlling the growth of spending. Spending was only up something like 4 percent. So, it isnt that were taking too little  from taxpayer  were spending too much still. And the formula Ive given you works, weve put it through a good economic model, weve got good economists on the West Coast, Michael Boskin and Marty Feldstein up there whos a very respected economist in the  Massachusetts. And they agree, that if we can do what Ive said, we can get it down without going and socking the American taxpayer once again. Capital gains, one more point on that, please lets learn from history. A capital gains differential will increase jobs, increase risk taking, increase revenues to the Federal Government.",1988-09-25,Republican

Dukakis,"Well, I hope all of those Americans out there who are watching us, listening to us and trying to make up their mind about which one of us ought to be president of the United States listen to the Vice President very carefully. What hes proposing after over a trillion in new debt which has been added in the Federal debt in the course of the past eight years, an IOU our children and grandchildren will be paying for years, is a tax cut for the wealthiest one percent of the people in this country, an average of about $30,000 that were going to give to people making $200,000 a year. Why thats more than the average teacher makes. Weve had enough of that, ladies and gentlemen. Weve run up more debt in the last eight years than under all the presidents from George Washington to Jimmy Carter combined.

Groer,"Mr. Vice President, youve said you want a kinder, gentler presidency, one that helps the less fortunate. Today, 37 million Americans including many working families with aging parents and young children cannot afford any health insurance, but earn too much to qualify for Medicaid. What will you do to provide protection for them and how will you pay for it?",1988-09-25,Moderator
Bush,"One thing I will not do is sock every business in the country and, thus, throw some people out of work. I want to keep this economic recovery going. More Americans at work today than any time in history, a greater percentage of the work force. What I will do is permit people to buy into Medicaid. I believe thats the answer. I am proud to have been part of an administration that past the first catastrophic health bill. And in that there are some Medicaid provisions that will be very helpful to the very kind of people were talking about here. But weve got to keep going forward without killing off the engine and throwing people out of work. So, the answer lies, it seems to me, in full enforcement of the catastrophic program. It lies to me in flexibility in Medicaid so people at the lowest end can buy in there and get their needs covered and then it also  I do not want to see us mandate across the board that every company has to do this, because I really think that marginal operators are going to go say, We cant make it. And I think then youre going to see that people are put out of work. All these programs  and this cost on his  is  was  I saw an estimate, Id love to know what he thinks, $35  $40 billion  and it seems to me that somebody pays that. There isnt any such thing as something free out there. It either gets passed along as increased prices or it gets passed along by people being put out of work so the business can continue to compete. So, I think we ought to do it in the Medicaid system. I think we ought to do it by full enforcement of the catastrophic health insurance. I think we ought to do it by everybody doing what they can do out of conscience. Its a terrible problems in terms of flexibility on private insurance. But I just dont want to mandate it and risk putting this  setting the recovery back.",1988-09-25,Republican

Dukakis,"Well, no, its no answer to those 37 million people, most of them members of working families who dont have a dime of health insurance and dont know how to pay the bills if their kids get sick at night. I was in Houston on Tuesday meeting with a group of good citizens, working citizens. All of them with little or no health insurance. One of them was a father who had been laid off a few months ago and lost his health insurance. Has an 11 year old son and cant let that son compete in sports and Little League, because hes afraid hes going to get hurt and he wont be able to provide health insurance to pay those bills. My state just became the only state in the nation to provide for universal health care and we did it with the support of the business community and labor and the health care community and with virtually everybody in the state. The fact of the matter is that employers who today are insuring their employees are paying the freight, because theyre paying for those who arent. And I think its time that when you got a job in this country it came with health insurance. Thats the way were going to provide basic health security for all of the citizens of this country of ours.",1988-09-25,Democrat

Because has won the support of a great many people all over the state and I think its a model for what I hope we can do across the country. But when I proposed my plan this past Tuesday, he or one of his spokesmen called it socialized medicine. The last time the Vice President used that phrase, I suspect he remembers it, dont you?

Dukakis,"Let me say this about AIDS. Its the single most important public health crisis, single most important public health emergency weve had in our lifetimes and I think there are a number of things we have to do including supporting legislation which is now moving through the Congress, which will commit this nation to the resources to find a cure which will provide broad education and prevention, which will provide sensitive and caring treatment for the victims of AIDS. I think we have to demonstrate some flexibility and I think the FDA is attempting to do so now in trying to make it possible for new and experimental drugs to be available to people who are at risk at AIDS and I would hope that we could bring that kind of a policy to bear beginning in January. And I would encourage the current administration to proceed with that kind of flexibility where its appropriate and where its done carefully and responsibly. But we have not had the kind of leadership we should have had. In this particular area, I think the Vice President and I are in general agreement on what we have to do.

I notice that the Governor did not mention any testing. But we got to have a knowledge base. Testing should be confidential, but we have to have a knowledge. We cant simply stick our heads in the sands in terms of testing. Im Chairman of the Presidents Task Force on Regulatory Relief and we are working with the FDA and they have sped up bringing drugs to market that can help. And you got to be careful here, because theres a safety factor, but I think these things  and then also I am one who believes weve got to go the extra mile in clean  being sure that that blood supply is pure. We cannot have a lack of confidence in the blood supply when it comes to operations and surgery and things of this nature.

Now, thats a certain passion that in my view its misguided passion. He  we have a big difference on issues. You see, last year in the primary, he expressed his passion. He said, I am a strong liberal Democrat  August, 87. Then he said, I am a card-carrying member of the ACLU. That was what he said. He is out there on out of the mainstream. He is very passionate.

But, Peter, please understand, the liberals do not like me talking about liberal They dont like it when I say that he says hes a card carrying member. Now, if that quote was wrong, he can repudiate it, right here. Ive seen it authoritatively written twice, and if Ive done him an injustice, and he didnt say it, Im very, very sorry. But I dont agree with a lot of  most of the positions of the ACLU. I simply dont want to see the ratings on movies. I dont want my ten year old grandchild to go into an X-rated movie. I like those ratings systems. I dont think theyre right to try to take the tax exemption away from the Catholic Church. I dont want to see the kiddie pornographic laws repealed; I dont want to see under God come out from our currency. Now, these are all positions of the ACLU. And I dont agree with them. He has every right to exercise his passion, as what he said, a strong, progressive liberal. I dont agree with that. I come from a different point. And I think Im more in touch with the mainstream of America. They raised the same thing with me on the Pledge of Allegiance. You see, Id have found a way to sign that bill. Governor Thompson of Illinois did. Im not questioning his patriotism. He goes out and says the man is questioning my patriotism. And then all the liberal columnists join in. I am not. I am questioning his judgment on these matters, or where hes coming from He has every right to do it. But I believe thats not what the American people want, and when he said, when he said at the convention, ideology doesnt matter, just competence, he was moving away from his own record, from what his passion has been over the years. And thats all Im trying to do, is put it in focus.

Mashek,"Mr. Vice President, in a debate during the Republican primaries, you said most of the nations homeless are suffering from mental illness, an assertion immediately challenged by one of your rivals. Estimates of the homeless range from a low of 250,000 by the government, to around three million, including working families and their children. What commitment are you willing to make tonight to this voiceless segment of our society?",1988-09-25,Moderator
Bush,"I want to see the McKinney Act fully funded. I believe that that would help in terms of shelter. I want to see  when I talked at our convention about a thousand points of light, I was talking about the enormous numbers of shelters and organizations that help. The governors wife has been very active in the homeless. My campaign chairman, Secretary Jim Bakers wife. This isnt government. These are people that care, that are trying to give of themselves. The government has a role. It is to fully fund the McKinney Act. There are certain army bases that the act calls for that can be used in certain cases to shelter people when its rough. And so I think that were on the right track. I dont see this, incidentally, as a Democrat or a Republican or a liberal or conservative idea. I see an involvement by a thousand points of light. I see the funding that is required, and I hope the Congress will fully fund this bill. They gave it a great deal of conscience and a great deal of work. And were on the track on this one. But  and I, look, mental  that was a little overstated it. Id say around 30 percent. And I think maybe we could look back over our shoulders and wonder whether it was right to let all those mental patients out. Maybe we need to do a better job in mental clinics to help them. Because there is a major problem there. A lot of them are mentally sick. And weve got to attend to them. But fully, my short range answer is fully fund that McKinney Act.",1988-09-25,Republican

Dukakis,"Well, this is another fundamental difference that I have with the vice president, just as I do in the case of health care for 37 million members of working families in this country who dont have health insurance. The problem, Mr. Bush, is that youve cut back by 90 percent on our commitment to affordable housing for families of low and moderate income. And when you do that, youve have homeless families. We didnt have two and a half million, or three million homeless people living on streets and in doorways in this country ten years ago. Weve got to begin to get back to the business of building and rehabilitating housing for families of low and moderate income in this country; housing for young families that they can look forward some day to buy. Weve got communities in this country increasingly where our own kids cant afford to live in the communities that they grew up in. Thats an essential commitment. And I think the housing community is ready. But its going to take a president whos committed to housing, whos had experience in building and rehabilitating housing who understands that affordable housing for families of low and moderate income, for young families, first time home buyers, is an essential part of the American dream. And while Im all for the McKinney bill, that, by itself, simply wont do. Weve got to have a president that can lead on this issue, that can work with the Congress, and Im prepared to do so. This is one of the most important priorities that faces this country.",1988-09-25,Democrat

Isnt providing housing for families of low and moderate income, isnt it making possible for young families, first time home buyers to own their own home some day something thats part of the American dream? I think so. You know, back after World War II when we had hundreds of thousands of GIs who came back from the war, we didnt sit around. We went out and built housing. The government was very much involved; so was the housing industry; so was the banking industry; so were housing advocates; so were non-profit agencies; so were governors and mayors and people all over this country who believe deeply in home ownership and affordable housing. Now, thats the kind of leadership that I want to provide as president of the United States. This isnt a question of a little charity for the homeless. This is a question of organizing the housing community. Ive talked to bankers and builders and developers, the housing advocates, community development agencies, and they want leadership from Washington. Washington, by itself, cant do it all. We shouldnt expect that. But governors are ready; mayors are ready. Builders and community leaders are ready. It will require some funds, John. And we ought to be prepared to provide those funds. But that, too, will require some choices. Mr. Bush wants to spend billions and trillions on Star Wars. Well, thats a choice we have to make, isnt it? Do we spend money on that weapon system in the billions and trillions, or is providing some decent and affordable housing for families of this country something that is at least as important and probably more so. Because its so essential to our economic strength and to our future. Now, thats the kind of presidency I believe in. And simply to say, well, the McKinney bill will do it just doesnt do. We need a president who will lead on this issue, who has had experience on this issue. Its the kind of priority that will be at the top of our list beginning in January of 1989.",1988-09-25,Democrat
Lehrer,"A response, Mr. Vice President.",1988-09-25,Moderator
Bush,"I think the governor is blurring housing and the homeless. Lets talk about housing which the question was. When you talk to those bankers, did they discuss where interest rates were when your party controlled the White House? Ten days before I took the oath of office as president they were 21 and a half percent. Now, how does that grab you for increasing housing? Housing is up. We are serving a million more families now. But were not going to do it in that old Democratic, liberal way of trying to build more bricks and mortars. Go out and take a look at St. Louis at some of that effort. It is wrong. I favor home ownership. I want to see more vouchers. I want to see control of some of these projects, and I want to keep the interest rates down. Theyre half, now of what they were when we came into office, and with my policy of getting this deficit under control, theyll be a lot less. But if we spend and spend and spend, that is going to wrap up the housing market, and well go right back to the days of the misery index and malaise that President Reagan and I have overcome  thank God for the United States on that one.",1988-09-25,Republican
Lehrer,"All right, the next question is to the governor. Ann Groer will ask it.",1988-09-25,Moderator
Groer,"Governor Dukakis, is there a conflict between your opposition to the death penalty and your support for abortion on demand, even though in the minds of many people, thats also killing?",1988-09-25,Moderator
Dukakis,"No, I dont think there is. There are two very different issues here, and theyve got to be dealt with separately. Im opposed to the death penalty. I think everybody knows that. Im also very tough on violent crime. And thats one of the reasons why my state has cut crime by more than any other industrial state in America. Its one of the reasons why we have the lowest murder rate of any industrial state in the country. Its one of the reasons why we have a drug education and prevention program that is reaching out and helping youngsters all over our state, the kind of thing I want to do as president of the United States. You know, the vice president says he wants to impose the death penalty on drug traffickers, and yet his administration has a federal furlough program which is one of the most permissive in the country, which gave last year 7,000 furloughs to drug traffickers and drug pushers, the same people that he says he now wants to execute. The issue of abortion is a very difficult issue, one that I think that we all have to wrestle with, we have to come to terms with. I dont favor abortion. I dont think its a good thing. I dont think most people do. The question is who makes the decision. And I think it has to be the woman, in the exercise of her own conscience and religious beliefs, that makes that decision.",1988-09-25,Democrat
Lehrer,"Response, Mr. Vice President.",1988-09-25,Moderator
Bush,"Well, the Massachusetts furlough program was unique. It was the only one in the nation that furloughed murderers who had not served enough time to be eligible for parole. The federal program doesnt do that. No other state programs do that. And I favor the death penalty. I know its tough and honest people can disagree. But when a narcotics wrapped up guy goes in and murders a police officer, I think they ought to pay with their life. And I do believe it would be inhibiting. And so I am not going to furlough men like Willie Horton, and I would meet with their, the victims of his last escapade, the rape and the brutalization of the family down there in Maryland. Maryland would not extradite Willie Horton, the man who was furloughed, the murderer, because they didnt want him to be furloughed again. And so we have a fundamental difference on this one. And I think most people know my position on the sanctity of life. I favor adoption. I do not favor abortion.",1988-09-25,Republican
Lehrer,"Question for the vice president, Ann?",1988-09-25,Moderator
Groer,"Yes. Mr. Vice President, Id like to stay with abortion for just a moment if I might. Over the years you have expressed several positions, while opposing nearly all forms of government payment for it. You now say that you support abortion only in cases of rape, incest, or threat to a mothers life, and you also support a constitutional amendment that if ratified would outlaw most abortions. But if abortions were to become illegal again, do you think that the women who defy the law and have them anyway, as they did before it was okayed by the Supreme Court, and the doctors who perform them should go to jail?",1988-09-25,Moderator
Bush,"I havent sorted out the penalties. But I do know, I do know that I oppose abortion. And I favor adoption. And if we can get this law changed, everybody should make the extraordinary effort to take these kids that are unwanted and sometimes aborted, take the  let them come to birth, and then put them in a family where they will be loved. And you see, yes, my position has evolved. And its continuing to evolve, and its evolving in favor of life. And I have had a couple of exceptions that I support  rape, incest and the life of the mother. Sometimes people feel a little uncomfortable talking about this, but its much clearer for me now. As Ive seen abortions sometimes used as a birth control device, for heavens sakes. See the millions of these killings accumulate, and this is one where you can have an honest difference of opinion. We certainly do. But no, Im for the sanctity of life, and once that illegality is established, then we can come to grips with the penalty side, and of course theres got to be some penalties to enforce the law, whatever they may be.",1988-09-25,Republican
Lehrer,Governor.,1988-09-25,Moderator

I dont think its enough to come before the American people who are watching us tonight and say, well, I havent sorted it out. This is a very, very difficult and fundamental decision that all of us have to make. And what he is saying, if I understand him correctly, is that hes prepared to brand a woman a criminal for making this choice.",1988-09-25,Democrat

Dukakis,"Let me finish. Let me simply say that I think it has to be the woman in the exercise of her own conscience and religious beliefs that makes that decision, and I think thats the right approach, the right decision, and I would hope by this time that Mr. Bush had sorted out this issue and come to terms with it as I have. I respect his right to disagree with me. But I think its important that we have a position, that we take it, and we state it to the American people.",1988-09-25,Democrat
Lehrer,"Peter Jennings, a question for the vice president.",1988-09-25,Moderator
Jennings,"Mr. Vice President, Im struck by your discussion of women and the sanctity of life. And it leads me to recall your own phrase, that you are haunted by the lives which children in our inner cities live. Certainly the evidence is compelling. Theres an explosion of single parent families. And by any measure, these single parent families, many with unwanted children, are the source of poverty, school drop outs, crime, which many people in the inner city simply feel is out of control. If it haunts you so, why over the eight years of the Reagan-Bush administration have so many programs designed to help the inner cities been eliminated or cut?",1988-09-25,Moderator
Bush,"One of the reasons, and I first would like to know which programs youre talking about, and then we could talk on the merits of the programs. But, you see, my fundamental philosophy is give local and state government as much control as possible. That might be the explanation, if you tell me the program. I do strongly support the WIC program. I think it is good. I think part of the answer to this haunting of these children that are out there and suffering lies in extension of Medicaid, to challenge the states, and maybe were going to have to enforce more on the states in terms of Medicaid taking care of these. But, Peter, so much of it is, gets into a whole other phase of things. The neighborhood, the kind of environment people are growing up in, and that leads me to the programs Im talking about in terms of education. I think that part of it is the crime infested neighborhoods, and thats why Im a strong believer in trying to control crimes in the neighborhood, why I was so pleased to be endorsed by the policemen on the beat, the Boston Police Department the other day. I think they understand my commitment to helping them in the neighborhoods. And so its a combination of these things. But do not erode out of the system the thousand points of light. The people that are out there trying to help these kids, the programs like cities and schools, the work that Barbara Bush is doing so people can learn to read in this country and then go on and break this cycle of poverty. Im for Head Start and moving that up. And Ive already made a proposal  and yes, it will cost some money. But I favor that. So these are the combination of things I want, and the fact that I dont think the federal government can endorse a $35 billion program does not mean I have less compassion than the person who endorses such a program.",1988-09-25,Republican
Lehrer,Governor.,1988-09-25,Moderator
Dukakis,"Well, I must have been living through a different eight years then the ones the vice presidents been living through, because this administration has cut and slashed and cut and slashed programs for children, for nutrition, for the kinds of things that can help these youngsters to live better lives. Its cut federal aid to education; its cut Pell grants and loans to close the door to college opportunity on youngsters all over this country. And that, too, is a major difference between the vice president and me. Let me just give you one other example. We have a great many people, hundreds of thousands of people living on public assistance in this country. The 50 governors of this nation have proposed to the Congress that we help those families to get off of welfare, help those youngsters, help their mothers to become independent and self-sufficient. Its taken months and months and months to get Mr. Bush and the administration to support that legislation, and theyre still resisting. Thats the way you help people. Being haunted, a thousand points of light  I dont know what that means. I know what strong political leadership is. I know whats happened over the course of the past eight years. These programs have been cut and slashed and butchered, and theyve hurt kids all over this country.",1988-09-25,Democrat
Lehrer,"A question for the governor, Peter.",1988-09-25,Moderator
Jennings,"Governor, the crisis is no less a crisis for you if you are elected president. Where would you get the money to devote to the inner cities which is clearly needed. And can you be specific about the programs not only youd reinstate, but the more imaginative ones that youd begin.",1988-09-25,Moderator
Dukakis,"Well, I said a few minutes ago, Peter, that you could improve the lives of families and youngsters and save money at the same time. Welfare reform is one way to do it. If we invest in job training, in child care for those youngsters, in some extended health benefits so that that mother and her kids dont lose their health benefits when she goes to work, we can help literally hundreds of thousands, if not millions of families, to get off of welfare, to become independent and self-sufficient, to be taxpaying citizens, and to improve their lives, the quality of lives, their futures, and the futures of those children. Thats just one example of how you can save money and improve the quality of life at the same time. In my own state, for example, we now have that universal health care system, which the vice president opposes, I think very unwisely. One of the greatest barriers to opportunity for a family and for those children is the threat that they mat lose their health insurance. Think about that father down there in Houston who has to tell his youngster that he cant play little league ball that he cant go out on the ball field because hes afraid hes going to get hurt. And yet, Mr. Bush says well, I dont think we ought to expect business to provide health insurance for their employees, when responsible employers, a majority of employers in this country do and are paying more for their insurance to reimburse hospitals for free care on account of people that are not insured, that have to go to that hospital. So these are the ways that you help families, you help youngsters to live better lives, and more decent lives. Were ready to go to work at the state and local level, all of us. I know the private sector is. People are all over the country. But it takes presidential leadership. It takes a commitment to being involved and the leading. And thats the kind of presidency I want to lead.",1988-09-25,Democrat
Lehrer,Mr. Vice President.,1988-09-25,Moderator
Bush,"What troubles me is that when I talk of the voluntary sector and a thousand points of light and a thousand different ways to help on these problems, the man has just said he doesnt understand what Im talking about. This is the problem I have with the big spending liberals. They think the only way to do it is for the federal government to do it all. The fact happens to be that education spending is up by the federal government; it is up. It is not down. But heres the point he misses. The federal government spends seven percent of the total on education, and the rest of the state governments and local governments and the thousand points of lightened Im talking about private schools and private church schools and things of this natureare putting up 93 percent. But the federal spending for education is up, and I want to be the education president, because I want to see us do better. Were putting more money per child into education, and we are not performing as we should. Weve gotten away fro values and the fundamentals. And I would like to urge the school superintendents and the others around the country to stand up now and keep us moving forward on a path towards real excellence. And we can do it. But its not going to be dedicated by some federal bureaucracy in Washington, D.C.",1988-09-25,Republican
Lehrer,"All right, lets move now to some questions on foreign and national security policy. John Mashek will ask the first question of the governor.",1988-09-25,Moderator
Mashek,"Governor, the vice president continually refers to your lack of experience, weakness, naivete on foreign policy and national security matters. He says you are prepared to eliminate weapons system that will result in the unilateral disarmament of this country. Is that true?",1988-09-25,Moderator
Dukakis,"Of course not. Of course thats a charge thats always made against any governor who runs for the presidency. I think it was one of the things that Mr. Bush said about Mr. Reagan back in 1980. Remember that, George? And yet some of our finest presidents, some of our strongest international leaders were governors-Franklin Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson, Theodore Roosevelt. Its not the amount of time you spend in Washington. Its not the length of your resume. Its your strength, its your values, its the quality of the people you pick. Its your understanding of the forces of change that are sweeping the world, and whether or not youre in a position to provide leadership to make those forces of change work for us and not against us. The vice president has a long resume. But it didnt stop him from endorsing the sale of arms to the Ayatollah. And we now know that he was not out of the loop; he was in meeting after meeting listening to Secretary Shultz and Secretary Weinberger opposing that, and yet he supported it. His experience didnt prevent him from participating or involving or in some way being involved in the relationship between this government and Mr. Noriega and drug trafficking in Panama. He went to Philippines in the early 80s and commended Ferdinand Macros for his commitment to democracy. And he continues to support a failed policy in Central America which is getting worse and worse, and which has in fact increased Cuban and Soviet influence in that region. So I dont believe that the fact youve got that long resume or had that experience is the real question. The question is values; the question is strength, the question is your willingness to provide the kind of leadership that must be provided. Im ready to provide that leadership. I want to be the commander in chief of this country. I think it take fresh leadership now, and an understanding of those forces of change to provide the kind of strength that we need, and perhaps the vice president can explain what he was doing when he supported the trading of arms to terrorist nation, and his involvement in Panama and that endorsement of Mr. Macros. But I dont think its just experience that makes the difference. Its strength; its values.",1988-09-25,Democrat

Now, were sitting down and talking to the Soviets about strategic arms, and he wants to do away with the Midgetman and the MX, the modernization or our nuclear capability. That is not the way you deal with the Soviets. Ive met Mr. Gorbachev. Met Mr. Shevardnadze and talked substance with him the other day. These people are tough. But now we have a chance. I few have experience and now how to handle it, but please do not go back to the days when the military was as weak as they could be, when the morale was down, and when we were the laughing stock around the world.

Im simply not going to do that. And under me, when I lead this country, the secretary of defense is going to have to make the choices, between how we keep, how we protect the survivability of our nuclear deployment on the Midgetman missile, or on the Minuteman, whatever it is.

Of course were going to have to make some determination on this, and were going to have to make it on the convention forces. But now weve got a very good concept called competitive strategies. We will do what we do best. Its a strategy that weve been working on for a couple of years. It is going to take us to much better advantage in conventional forces. But look, let me sum it up. I want to be the president that gets conventional forces balance. I want to be the one to banish chemical and biological weapons from the face of the earth.

As a matter of fact, he said it was not and should not be subject to partisan demagoguery because it was too important for the United States or for the world. I didnt hear, John, exactly where he was going to cut and what he was going to do. But I know this, we have serious financial problems in this country. Weve piled up over a trillion dollars in debt and the next president of the United States is going to have to make some choices. Mr. Bush wants to spend billions on Star Wars. He apparently wants to spend billions on the MX on railroad cars, a weapons system we dont need and cant afford. I thought the administration was opposed to the Midgetman. I thought the administration was at the negotiating table in Geneva suggesting that we ban mobile missile systems entirely. But those are the choices the next president of the United States is going to have to make. Im for the Stealth, Im for the D-5, Im for going ahead with the advance Cruise missile. But I dont think we need these other systems. I dont think we need them to remain strong. Weve got to move ahead with the strategic arms negotiation process, with the comprehensive test ban treaty and with negotiations leading to conventional force reduction in Europe with deeper cuts on the Soviet side and Senator Bentsen and I will pursue that policy.",1988-09-25,Democrat

Groer,"Well, Mr. Vice President, you said youve met with Secretary General Gorbachev, youve met with Mr. Shevardnadze, but for the last forty years Americans have been taught to regard the Soviet Union as the enemy. Yet, President Reagan has signed two arms control treaties and hes promised to share Star Wars technology with the very country he once called the evil empire. So, perhaps you can tell us this evening, should we be doing a lot to help the economics and the social development of a country that we have so long regarded as an adversary?BUSH: What I think we ought to do is take a look at perestroika and glasnost, welcome them, but keep our eyes open. Be cautious. Because the Soviet change is not fully established yet. Yes, I think its fine to do business with them. And, so, Im encouraged with what I see when I talk to Mr.  what I hear when I talk to Mr. Gorbachev and Mr. Shevardnadze, but can they pull it off. And when they have a they a deals that are good for us, as China started to dothe changes in China since Barbara and I lived there is absolutely amazing, in terms of incentive, in partnership and things of this nature. And now the Soviet Union seems to be walking down that same path. We should encourage that. We ought to say this is good. But where I differ with my opponent is I am not going to make unilateral cuts in our strategic defend systems or support some freeze when they have superiority. Im not going to do that, because I think the jury is still out on the Soviet experiment. And the interesting place-one of the things that fascinates me about this perestroika and glasnost is wheats going to happen in Eastern Europe. You see the turmoil in Poland today. And I think we have enormous opportunity for trade. I dont want to go back to the Carter grain embargo on the Soviets. We are once again reliable suppliers and I would never use food as a political tool like our predecessors did. But this is an exciting time. But all Im suggesting is lets not be nave in dealing with the Soviets and make a lot of unilateral cuts hoping against hope that they will match our bid. Look at the INF treaty. And if we havent learned from the negotiating history on that, well never learn. The freeze people were wrong. The Reagan-Bush administration was right.",1988-09-25,Moderator

Dukakis,"It was a very different George Bush who was talking much more sympathetically about the freeze in the spring of 1982 than he is today. And you were right then, George, when you said it was no time for partisan demagoguery. Nobody is suggesting that we unilaterally disarm or somehow reduce our strength, of course not. What were talking about is a combination of a strong and effective and credible nuclear deterrent. Strong, well-equipped, well-trained, well-maintained conventional forces. And at the same time a willingness to move forward steadily, thoughtfully cautiously. We have serious differences with the Soviet Union. We have very fundamental differences about human rights, democracy and our basic system, our basic view of human beings and of what life is all about. But there are opportunities there now. Senator Bentsen and I have a plan for the 1990s and beyond. Mr. Bush and Mr. Quayle do not. And we want to pursue that plan in a way which will bring down the level of nuclear armament, will build a more stable and more peaceful world while making choices here at home. Lets not forget that our national security and our economic security go hand in hand.

Groer,"Yes. Governor Dukakis, speaking of seeming changes of position, you have gone from calling the Strategic Defense Initiative, or Star Wars, a fantasy and a fraud, to saying recently that you would continue SDI research and might even deploy the system if Congress supported such a move. Why the change of heart?",1988-09-25,Moderator
Dukakis,"No, theres been no change of heart. I said from the beginning that we ought to continue research into the strategic system at about the level that was added in 1983, thats about a billion dollars a year. But I dont know of any reputable scientist who believed that this system, at least as originally conceived could possibly work, this notion of some kind of astrodome over ourselves that could protect us from enemy attack. It makes real sense. And as a matter of fact, the system that the administration is now talking about is very different from the one that was originally proposed in 1983. So, Im for continued research, but I also want strong conventional forces. Now, the other day, Mr. Bush said, Well, if we continue with Star War-Star Wars-we have to cut some place. He hasnt told us where. We know where theyre cutting. We know where youre cutting right now. Youre cutting into the fiber and muscle of our conventional forces. Youre cutting back on maintenance and equipment. An Air Force General not too long ago in Europe who said that pretty soon wed have airplanes without engines, tank commanders who cant drive their tanks more than three-quarters of a mile, because they dont have enough fuel. Coast Guard cutters tied up at the dock this summer, not patrolling. Theyre supposed to be our first line of defense against drugs and the war against drugs, because they dont have enough fuel. You have to make choices. Were not making those choices. And to spend billions and billions of dollars as Mr. Bush apparently wants to, although, he, himself has been all over the lot on this issue lately-on Star Wars-in my judgment makes no sense at all. We need a strong, credible, effective nuclear deterrent. We have 13,000 strategic nuclear warheads right now on land, on sea and in the air, enough to blow up the Soviet Union forty times over. They have about 12,000. So, weve got to move forward with those negotiations, get the level of strategic weapons down. But to continue to commit billions to this system makes no sense at all and I think Mr. Bush has been reconsidering his position over the course of the past few weeks.

The armed forces, the conventional forces of the United States have never been more ready. Every single one of the Joint Chiefs will testify to the fact that readiness is in an historic high.

Lehrer,"Peter Jennings, a question for Governor Dukakis.",1988-09-25,Moderator
Jennings,"Well, Governor, and Vice President Bush, youve both talked tonight about hard choices. Let me try to give you one. Somewhere in the Middle East tonight, nine Americans are being held hostage. If you are commander-in-chief and Americans are held hostage, what will be more important to you, their individual fate, or the commitment that the United States Government must never negotiate with terrorists. And if any Americans are held hostage and you become president, to what lengths would you go to rescue them?",1988-09-25,Moderator
Dukakis,"Peter, its one of the most agonizing decisions a president has to make. These are American citizens, we care deeply about them. Their families care deeply about them, want them back and understandably so and we want to do everything we can to bring them back. But if theres one thing we also understand it is that you cannot make concessions to terrorists, ever, ever. Because if you do, its an open invitation to other terrorists to take hostages and to blackmail us. And thats the tragedy of the Iran/Contra scandal. As a matter of fact, Mr. Bush was the Chairman of a task force on international terrorism which issued a report shortly before that decision was made and said, and rightly so, that we never ever can make concessions to terrorists and hostage takers. And, yet, after sitting through meeting after meeting, he endorsed that decision, endorsed the sale of arms to the Ayatollah in exchange for hostages, one of the most tragic, one of the most mistaken foreign policy decisions weve ever made in this country and I dare say encouraged others to take hostages as we now know. So, there can be no concessions under any circumstances, because if we do its an open invitation to others to do the same. Weve got to be tough on international terrorism. Weve got to treat it as international crime. Weve got to attack at all points, weve go to use undercover operations. We have to be prepared to use military force against terrorist base camps, we have to work closely with our allies to make sure that theyre working with us and we with them and we can give no quarter when it comes to breaking the back of international terrorism. Yes, we should make every effort to try to help those hostages come home, but it can never be because we make concessions. That was a tragic mistake that we made, a mistake that Mr. Bush made and others made and it should never ever be made again.",1988-09-25,Democrat
Lehrer,Mr. Vice President?,1988-09-25,Moderator
Bush,"I wrote the anti-terrorist report for this government. It is the best anti-terrorist report written. Yes, we shouldnt trade arms for hostages. But we have made vast improvements in our anti-terrorism. Now, its fine to say that sometimes you have to hit base camps, but when the president saw this state sponsored-fingerprints of Muammar Khadaffi on the loss of American life, he hit Libya. And my opponent was unwilling to support that action.",1988-09-25,Republican
Dukakis,Thats not true. Thats not true.,1988-09-25,Democrat
Bush,"And since that action, terrorist action against the United States citizens have gone down.",1988-09-25,Republican
Dukakis,Thats not true.,1988-09-25,Democrat
Bush,And I have long ago said I supported the president on this other matter. And Ive said mistakes were made. Clearly nobodys going to think the president started out thinking he was going to trade arms for hostages. That is a very serious charge against the president. The matter has been thoroughly looked into. But the point is sometimes the action-,1988-09-25,Republican
Bush," has to be taken by the Federal Government and when we took action, it had a favorable response.",1988-09-25,Republican
Lehrer,A question for the Vice President. Peter?,1988-09-25,Moderator
Jennings,"It seems perhaps a good subject, Mr. Vice President, on which to make the point that youve campaigned vigorously as part of a leadership team. But so far you wont tell the American people in considerable measure what advice you gave the president, including the sale of arms to Iran and what should have been done about the hostages. To the best of my knowledge theres no Constitutional requirement which prevents you from doing so. Jimmy Carter urged his Vice President, Walter Mondale, to tell the American people. Would you now ask President Reagan for permission to tell the American people what advice you did give him? And if you dont, how do we judge your judgment in the Oval Office in the last eight years?",1988-09-25,Moderator
Bush,"Youre judged by the whole record. Youre judged by the entire record. Are we closer to peace? Are we doing better in anti-terrorism? Should we have listened to my opponent who wanted to send the UN into the Persian Gulf or in spite of the mistakes of the past, are we doing better there? How is our credibility with the GCC countries on the Western side of the Gulf. Is Iran talking to Iraq about peace? You judge on the record. Are the Soviets coming out of Afghanistan? How does it look in a program he called or some one of these marvelous Boston adjective up there and-about Angola-now, we have a chance-several Bostonians dont like it, but the rest of the country will understand.",1988-09-25,Republican
Bush,"Now we have a chance. Now we have a chance. And, so, I think that Id leave it right there and say that you judge on the whole record. And let me say this-all he can talk about-he goes around ranting about Noriega. Now, Ive told you what the intelligence briefing he received said about that. He can talk about Iran/Contra and also-Ill make a deal with you, I will take the blame for those two incidents if you give me half the credit for all the good things that have happened in world peace since Ronald Reagan and I took over from the Carter administration.",1988-09-25,Republican
Bush,I still have a couple of minutes left. And there is a difference principle,1988-09-25,Republican
Lehrer,"Sorry, Mr. Vice President.",1988-09-25,Moderator

Dukakis,"He can have another ten seconds if he wants, Jim.",1988-09-25,Democrat
Lehrer,"Governor, you have a minute to respond.",1988-09-25,Moderator
Dukakis,"Well, the matter of judgment is very important. And I think its important to understand what happened here. A report on international terrorism chaired by the Vice President was released and made some very specific recommendations about how to deal with terrorism. They were ignored. The Vice President ignored them. He says mistakes were made. Very serious mistakes in judgment were made. He says, Well, lets concede that the administration has been doing business with Noriega. Has made him a part of our foreign policy and has been funneling aid to Contras through convicted drug dealers. I think those are very very serious questions of judgment, which those of you who are watching us here tonight have a right to judge and review. Were not going to make those kinds of mistakes. You cannot make concessions to terrorists. If you do, you invite the taking of more hostages. Thats a basic principle. It was ignored in that case and it was a very very serious mistake in judgment.",1988-09-25,Democrat
Lehrer,A question from John Mashek. It goes to the Vice President.,1988-09-25,Moderator
Mashek,"Mr. Vice President, Democrats and even some Republicans are still expressing reservations about the qualifications and credentials of Senator Dan Quayle of Indiana, your chosen running mate, to be a heartbeat away from the presidency. What do you see in him that others do not?",1988-09-25,Moderator
Bush,"I see a young man that was elected to the Senate twice, to the House of Representatives twice. I see a man who is young and I am putting my confidence in a whole generation of people that are in their 30s and 40s. I see a man that took the leadership in the Job Training Partnership Act and that retrains people in this highly competitive changing society were in, so if a person loses his hob he is retrained for a benefit-for a-work that will be productive and he wont have to go on one of these many programs that the liberal-talking about. I see a young man who is a knowledgeable-in defense and there are three people on our ticket that are knowledgeable-in the whole-in the race-knowledgeable in defense and Dan Quayle is one of them and I am one of them. And I believe that he will be outstanding. And he took a tremendous pounding and everybody now knows that he took a very unfair pounding. And Id like each person to say did I jump to conclusions running down rumors that were so outrageous and so brutal. And hes kept his head up. And he will do very very well. And he has my full confidence and hell have the confidence of people that are in their 30s and 40s and more. So, judge the man on his record not on the-lot of rumors and innuendo and trying to fool around with his name. My opponent says J. Danforth Quayle. Do you know who J. Danforth was, he was a man who gave his life in World War II, so ridiculing a persons name is a little beneath this process. And hell do very well when we get into the debates.",1988-09-25,Republican
Dukakis,"Well, when it comes to ridicule, George, you win a gold medal. I think we can agree on that in the course of this campaign.",1988-09-25,Democrat
Bush,Just the facts.,1988-09-25,Republican
Dukakis,But did I-did I sense a desire that maybe Lloyd Bentsen ought to be your running mate when you said there are three people on your ticket?,1988-09-25,Democrat
Bush,"No, I think the debate ought to be between you and Lloyd.",1988-09-25,Republican
Dukakis,"I think the American people have a right to judge us on this question, on how we picked a running mate, a person who is a heartbeat away from the presidency. I picked Lloyd Bentsen, distinguished, strong, mature, a leader in the Senate, somebody whose qualifications nobody has questioned. Mr. Bush picked Dan Quayle. I doubt very much that Dan Quayle was the best qualified person for that job. And as a matter of fact, I think for most people the notion of President Quayle is a very very troubling thought.",1988-09-25,Democrat
Lehrer,John will ask a question of the Governor. It will be the last question and then the Vice President will have a rebuttal.,1988-09-25,Moderator
Mashek,"Well, Governor, you did select Lloyd Bentsen of Texas.",1988-09-25,Moderator
Dukakis,I did indeed.,1988-09-25,Democrat
Mashek,"And you have a lot of disagreement with him on fundamental issues, including the Reagan tax cuts, aid to the rebels in Nicaragua, the death penalty, gun control. Whos right?",1988-09-25,Moderator
Dukakis,"Well, John, Im a man thats been a chief executive for ten years. Ive picked a lot of people. Ive picked cabinets. Ive named judges. I know that the people you pick make an enormous difference in your ability to govern and I set high standards. I try to meet them and I insist that people who work for me meet them, if they dont, they dont stick around very long. But I didnt pick Lloyd Bentsen because he was a clone of Mike Dukakis. I picked him because he was somebody who would be a strong Vice President, somebody who would be an active Vice President. Somebody who would come to me if somebody came up with a crazy idea that we ought to trade arms to the Ayatollah for hostages and say, Mr. President, thats wrong. We shouldnt do that. Thats the kind of Vice President I want. He, himself, has said, and rightly so, that hell be a strong Vice President. When the Vice President makes a decision, that will be his decision. And Im very very proud of that choice. And I didnt pick him because he agreed with me on everything. You know, Sam Rayburn once said that if two people agree on everything then only one person is doing the thinking. The fact is Ive picked somebody who not only will be a great Vice President, but if, God forbid, something happens to the president, could step into that office and do so with distinction and with strength and with leadership. I doubt very much. I doubt very much that Mr. Bushs selection for the Vice Presidency of the United States meets that test.",1988-09-25,Democrat
Lehrer,Mr. Vice President?,1988-09-25,Moderator
Bush,"Well, I-we obviously have a difference. I believe it does meet the test. Well have an opportunity to see the two of them in action in a friendly forum, wonderful friendly fashion like this.",1988-09-25,Republican
Bush,"I had hoped this had been a little friendlier evening. I wanted to hitchhike a ride home in his tank with him. But now weve got the lines too carefully drawn here. But you talk about judgment. I mean, what kind of judgment-I mean, jumping all over the president on his decision on one area of farm policy. What kind of judgment sense has your chief education adviser now in jail in Massachusetts? I mean, theres-I dont think this is a fair argument. But nevertheless, I support my nominee for Vice President and hell do an outstanding job.",1988-09-25,Republican
Lehrer,"Gentlemen, I was given some bad word a moment ago. There is time for one more question. Getting it in my ear and Ann Groer will ask it. Ann? To the Governor.",1988-09-25,Moderator
Groer,"Governor Dukakis, as many U.S. farmers face or undergo foreclosure, the United States is considering the possibility of forgiving a certain percentage of debt owed by Latin American and Third World countries, do you favor giving these countries a break in their loans and, if so, how do you explain that to the American farmers who are losing their land and livelihood?",1988-09-25,Moderator
Dukakis,"Well, I think we have to go to work on the problem of Third World debt and weve got to assist those Third World countries in dealing with this massive debt which they currently-which they have incurred and which is burdening them and which if we dont do something about it and assist them along with other nations around the world, well destroy their economies, destroy their future. And at the same time will destroy markets that are important to our farmers. But I also believe we need an agricultural policy which doesnt cost us 15 to 20 to 25 billion dollars a year that its been costing us over the course of the past three or four years under this administration. I think its going to require good, solid credit policies. And thanks to the Congress we now have an agricultural credit bill which is helping and improving the situation with at least some of our farmers. I think its going to require a combination of supply management and reasonable price supports to make sure that our farmers get a decent price and I think it also is going to require an administration that understand that there are tremendous opportunities out there for the development of new uses for agricultural products, new uses which can help us to clean up our environment at the same time. Bio-degradable plastics-plastic-gasohol, which the Vice President has been involved in, road de-icers made from corn products. I mean, there are enormous opportunities out there to expand markets and to build a strong future for our farmers. But I dont think theres anything mutually exclusive or contradictory about building a strong farm economy in this country and assisting our family farms and providing a good strong future for rural communities and for rural America and at the same time working on Third World debt. As a matter of fact, Mexico, itself, is one of our biggest agricultural customers, so in the sense that we can work to help Mexico rebuild and expand and deal with these very serious economic problems we help our farmers at the same time.",1988-09-25,Democrat
Lehrer,Mr. Vice President?,1988-09-25,Moderator
Bush,"I oppose supply management and production controls. I support the farm bill, the 1985 farm bill and spending is moving in the right direction. I want to expand our markets abroad and thats why Ive called for that first economic summit to be on agriculture. I will not go back to the way the Democrats did it and used food as a political weapon and throw a grain embargo on the farmers in this country. I want to see rural redevelopment and I have been out front in favor of alternate sources of energy and one of them is gasohol and comes from using your corn and I think we can do better in terms of biodegradable for a lot of product, so Im optimistic about the agricultural economy. In terms of the Third World, I support the Baker plan. I want to see market economies spring up all around the world and to the degree they do, we are succeeding. And I dont want to see the banks let off the hook. I would oppose that, but I think were on the right track in agriculture and I am very very encouraged. But lets not go back to that-what they call supply management and production control, thatll simply price us out of the international market. Lets try to expand our markets abroad.",1988-09-25,Republican
Lehrer,"All right. That really is the end. Now, lets go to closing statements. They will be two minutes each in duration by agreement. Vice President Bush goes first. Governor Dukakis second. Mr. Vice President.",1988-09-25,Moderator
Bush,"I talked in New Orleans about a gentler and kinder nation and I have made specific proposals on education and the environment and on ethics and energy and how we do better in battling crime in our country. But there are two main focal points of this election. Opportunity and peace. I want to keep this expansion going. Yes, we want change but we are the change. I am the change. I dont want to go back to malaise and misery index. And, so, opportunity. Keep America at work. The best poverty program is a job with dignity in the private sector. And in terms of peace, we are on the right track. Weve achieved an arms control agreement that our critics thought was never possible and I want to build on it. I want to see us finalize that START agreement and I want it to be the one to finally lead the world to banishing chemical and biological weapons. I want to see asymmetrical reductions in conventional forces. And then it gets down to a question of values. Weve had a chance to spell out our differences on the Pledge of Allegiance here tonight and on tough sentencing of drug king pins and this kind of thing. And I do favor the death penalty. And weve got a wide array of differences on those. But in the final analysis-in the final analysis, the person goes into that voting booth, theyre going to say, Who has the values I believe in? Who has the experience that we trust? Who has the integrity and stability to get the job done? My fellow Americans, I am that man and I ask for your support. Thank you very much.",1988-09-25,Republican
Dukakis,"This has been an extraordinary 18 months for Kitty and me and for our family. Weve had an opportunity to campaign all over this country and to meet with so many of you in communities and states and regions to get to know you. Im more optimistic today than I was when I began about this nation providing we have the kind of leadership in Washington that can work with you, that can build partnerships, that can build jobs in every part of this country, not certain parts of this country. You know, my friends, my parents came to this country as immigrants like millions and millions of Americans before them and since, seeking opportunities, seeking the American dream. They made sure their sons understood that this was the greatest country in the world, that those of us especially who were the sons and daughters of immigrants had a special responsibility to give something to the country that had opened up its arms to our parents and given so much to them. I believe in the American dream. Im a product of it and I want to help that dream come true for every single citizen in this land, with a good job and good wages, with good schools in every part of this country and every community in this country. With decent and affordable housing that our people can buy and own and live in, so that we end the shame of hopelessness in America. With decent and affordable healthcare for all working families. Yes, its a tough problem as Mr. Bush says, but its not an insolvable problem. Its one that we will solve and must solve, with a clean and wholesome environment and with a strong America thats strong militarily and economically as we must be, an America that provides strong international leadership because were true to our values. We have an opportunity working together to build that future, to build a better America, to build a best America, because the best America doesnt hide. We compete. The best America. We invest. The best America doesnt leave some of its citizens behind. We live-we bring everybody along. And the best America is not behind us. The best America is yet to come.

Participants,Former Vice President Joe Biden (D) and,2020-10-22,Moderator
Moderator,Kristen Welker (NBC News),2020-10-22,Moderator
Welker,"Good evening from Belmont University in Nashville, Tennessee. Im Kristen Welker of NBC News and I welcome you to the final 2020 presidential debate between President Donald J. Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden. Tonights debate is sponsored by The Commission on Presidential Debates. It is conducted under health and safety protocols designed by the commissions health security advisor. The audience here in the hall has promised to remain silent. No cheers, boos or other interruptions except right now, as we welcome to the stage former Vice President Joe Biden and President Donald J. Trump. And I do want to say a very good evening to both of you. This debate will cover six major topics. At the beginning of each section, each candidate will have two minutes, uninterrupted, to answer my first question. The debate commission will then turn on their microphone only when it is their turn to answer, and the commission will turn it off exactly when the two minutes have expired. After that, both microphones will remain on, but on behalf of the voters, Im going to ask you to please speak one at a time. The goal is for you to hear each other and for the American people to hear every word of what you both have to say. And so with that, if youre ready, lets start. And we will begin with the fight against the coronavirus. President Trump, the first question is for you. The country is heading into a dangerous new phase. More than 40,000 Americans are in the hospital tonight with COVID, including record numbers here in Tennessee. And since the two of you last shared a stage, 16,000 Americans have died from COVID. So please be specific: how would you lead the country during this next stage of the coronavirus crisis? Two minutes, uninterrupted.",2020-10-22,Moderator
Trump,"So, as you know, 2.2 million people, modeled out, were expected to die. We closed up the greatest economy in the world in order to fight this horrible disease that came from China. Its a worldwide pandemic. Its all over the world. You see the spikes in Europe and many other places right now. If you notice, the mortality rate is down, 85%. The excess mortality rate is way down, and much lower than almost any other country. And were fighting it and were fighting it hard. There is a spike. There was a spike in Florida, and its now gone. There was a very big spike in Texas, its now gone. There was a very big spike in Arizona, its now gone. And there were some spikes and surges in other places. They will soon be gone. We have a vaccine thats coming, its ready. Its going to be announced within weeks, and its going to be delivered. We have Operation Warp Speed, which is the military, is going to distribute the vaccine. I can tell you from personal experience that I was in the hospital, I had it. And I got better and I will tell you that I had something that they gave me  a therapeutic, I guess they would call it. Some people could say it was a cure. But I was in for a short period of time and I got better very fast or I wouldnt be here tonight. And now they say Im immune. Whether its four months or a lifetime, nobodys been able to say that, but Im immune. More and more people are getting better. We have a problem thats a worldwide problem. This is a worldwide problem, but Ive been congratulated by the heads of many countries on what weve been able to do with the  if you take a look at what weve done in terms of goggles and masks and gowns and everything else, and in particular, ventilators. Were now making ventilators. All over the world, thousands and thousands a month, distributing them all over the world, it will go away and as I say, were rounding the turn, were rounding the corner, its going away.",2020-10-22,Republican
Welker,"OK, former Vice President Biden, to you, how would you lead the country out of this crisis? You have two minutes uninterrupted.",2020-10-22,Moderator
Biden,"220,000 Americans dead. If you hear nothing else I say tonight, hear this. Anyone whos responsible for not taking control  in fact, not saying, I take no responsibility, initially  anyone who is responsible for that many deaths should not remain as President of the United States of America. Were in a situation where there are thousands of deaths a day, a thousand deaths a day. And there are over 70,000 new cases per day. Compared to whats going on in Europe, as the New England Medical Journal said, theyre starting from a very low rate. Were starting from a very high rate. The expectation is well have another 200,000 Americans dead by the time, between now and the end of the year. If we just wore these masks  the Presidents own advisors have told him  we could save 100,000 lives. And were in a circumstance where the President, thus far, still has no plan. No comprehensive plan. What I would do is make sure we have everyone encouraged to wear a mask, all the time. I would make sure we move in the direction of rapid testing, investing in rapid testing. I would make sure that we set up national standards as to how to open up schools and open up businesses so they can be safe, and give them the wherewithal and financial resources to be able to do that. Were in a situation now where the New England Medical Journal  one of the serious, most serious journals in the whole world  said for the first time ever that this, the way this President has responded to this crisis has been absolutely tragic. And so folks, I will take care of this, I will end this, I will make sure we have a plan.",2020-10-22,Democrat
Welker,"President Trump, Id like to follow up with you and your comments. You talked about taking a therapeutic. I assume youre referencing Regeneron. You also said a vaccine will be coming within weeks. Is that a guarantee?",2020-10-22,Moderator
Trump,"No, its not a guarantee but it will be by the end of the year, but I think it has a good chance. There are two companies, I think, within a matter of weeks, and it will be distributed very quickly.",2020-10-22,Republican
Welker,Can you tell us which companies?,2020-10-22,Moderator
Trump,"Johnson and Johnson is doing very well. Moderna is doing very well. Pfizer is doing very well, and we have numerous others. And then we also have others that were working on very closely with other countries, in particular Europe.",2020-10-22,Republican
Welker,"Let me follow up with you, and because this is new information  you have said a vaccine is coming soon, within weeks now. Your own officials say it could take well into 2021 at the earliest for enough Americans to get vaccinated, and even then they say the country will be wearing masks and distancing into 2022. Is your timeline realistic?",2020-10-22,Moderator
Trump,"No, I think my timeline is going to be more accurate. I dont know that theyre counting on the military the way I do, but we have our generals lined up, one in particular, thats the head of logistics. And this is a very easy distribution for him. Hes ready to go as soon as we have the vaccine, and we expect to have 100 million vials as soon as we have the vaccine, hes ready to go.",2020-10-22,Republican
Welker,"Vice President Biden, your reaction? Just 40% of Americans say they would definitely agree to take a coronavirus vaccine if it was approved by the government. What steps would you take to give Americans confidence in a vaccine if it were approved?",2020-10-22,Moderator
Biden,"Make sure its totally transparent. Have the scientific world see it, know it, look at it, go through all the processes. And by the way, this is the same fellow who told you this is going to end by Easter last time. This the same fellow who told you that, dont worry, were going to end this by the summer. Were about to go into a dark winter, a dark winter, and he has no clear plan and theres no prospect that theres going to be a vaccine available for the majority of the American people before the middle of next year.",2020-10-22,Democrat
Welker,"President Trump, your reaction? He says you have no plan.",2020-10-22,Moderator
Trump,"I dont think were going to have a dark winter at all. Were opening up our country. Weve learned and studied and understand the disease, which we didnt at the beginning. When I closed and banned China from coming in heavily infected, and then ultimately Europe, but China was in January  months later he was saying I was xenophobic, I did it too soon. Now hes saying, Oh, I should have, I should have, you know, moved quicker. But he didnt move quicker; he was months behind me, many months behind me. And frankly, he ran the H1N1 swine flu, and it was a total disaster. Far less lethal. But it was a total disaster. Had that had this kind of numbers, 700,000 people would be dead right now, but it was a far less lethal disease. Look, his own person who ran that for him who, as you know was his chief of staff, said It was catastrophic, it was horrible, we didnt know what we were doing. Now he comes up and he tells us how to do this. Also everything that he said about the way  every single move that he said we should make  thats what weve done, weve done all of it, but he was way behind us.",2020-10-22,Republican
Welker,"Vice President Biden, your response?",2020-10-22,Moderator
Biden,"My responses is, he is xenophobic but not because he shut down access from China. And he did it late, after 40 countries had already done that. In addition to that, what he did, he made sure that we had 44 people that were in there, in China, trying to get to Wuhan to determine what exactly the source was. What did the President say in January? He said no, he said, this is  hes being transparent, the president of China is being transparent. We owe him a debt of gratitude. We have to thank him. And then what happened was, we started talking about using the Defense Act, to make sure we go out and get whatever is needed out there to protect people. And again, I go back to this, he had nothing. He did virtually nothing. And then he gets out of the hospital, and he talks about were, this is, Oh, dont worry. This is all going to be over soon. Come on, theres not another serious scientist in the world who thinks its going to be over soon.",2020-10-22,Democrat
Welker,"President Trump, your reaction?",2020-10-22,Moderator
Trump,"I did not say over soon. I say were learning to live with it. We have no choice. We cant lock ourselves up in a basement like Joe does. He has the ability to lock himself up. I dont know, hes obviously made a lot of money, someplace, but he has this thing about living in a basement. People cant do that. By the way, I, as the president, couldnt do that. Id love to put myself in the basement or in a beautiful room in the White House and go away for a year and a half until it disappears. I cant do that. And Kristen  every, every meeting I had  every meeting I had  and Id meet a lot of families, including Gold Star families and military families, every meeting I had  and I had to meet them, I had to, it would be horrible to have canceled everything. I said, you know, this is dangerous. And you catch it. And you know, I caught it. I learned a lot. I learned a lot, great doctors, great hospitals. And now, I recovered. 99.9 of young people recover. 99% of people recover. We have to recover. We cant close up our nation, we have to open our school, and we cant close up our nation, or youre not going to have a nation.",2020-10-22,Republican

Biden,Can I respond to that?,2020-10-22,Democrat
Welker,"30 seconds please, and then I have a question.",2020-10-22,Moderator
Biden,"Number one. He says that were, you know, were learning to live with it. People are learning to die with it. You folks home will have an empty chair at the kitchen table this morning. That man or wife going to bed tonight and reaching over to try to touch their, out of habit, where their wife or husband was, is gone. Learning to live with it? Come on. Were dying with it, because hes never said  he said its dangerous. Whens the last time? Is it really dangerous, still? Are we dangerous? You tell the people its dangerous now? What should they do about the danger? And you say, I take no responsibility.",2020-10-22,Democrat
Welker,Let me talk about,2020-10-22,Moderator
Trump,Excuse me.,2020-10-22,Republican
Welker,Very quickly.,2020-10-22,Moderator
Trump,"I take full responsibility. Its not my fault that it came here. Its Chinas fault. And you know what, its not Joes fault that it came here either. Its Chinas fault. They kept it from going into the rest of China, for the most part, but they didnt keep it from coming out to the world including Europe and ourselves.",2020-10-22,Republican
Welker,Vice President Biden.,2020-10-22,Moderator
Biden,"The fact is, that when we knew it was coming, when it hit  what happened? What did the President say? He said dont worry, its going to go away, be gone by Easter. Dont worry, the warm weather. Dont worry, maybe inject bleach  he said he was kidding when he said that, but a lot of people thought it was serious. A whole range of things the President said. And even today, he thinks we are in control. Were about to lose 200,000 more people.",2020-10-22,Democrat
Welker,President Trump.,2020-10-22,Moderator
Trump,"Look, perhaps just to finish this, I was kidding on that but just to finish this. When I closed, he said, I shouldnt have closed. And that went on for months. What Nancy Pelosi said the same thing. She was dancing on the streets in Chinatown in San Francisco. But when I closed, he said, this is a terrible thing. Youre xenophobic. I think he called me racist, even, and because I was closing it to China. Now he says I should have closed it earlier. It just, Joe, it doesnt work.",2020-10-22,Republican
Biden,I didnt say either of those things.,2020-10-22,Democrat
Trump,You certainly did.,2020-10-22,Republican
Biden,I talked about his xenophobia in a different context. It wasnt about closing the border to Chinese coming to the United States.,2020-10-22,Democrat

Biden,No.,2020-10-22,Democrat
Welker,"OK, lets talk about your different strategies toward dealing with this. Mr. Vice President, you suggested you would support new shutdowns if scientists recommended it. What do you say to Americans who are fearful that the cost of shutdowns, the impact on the economy, the higher rates of hunger, depression, domestic and substance abuse, outweighs the risk of exposure to the virus?",2020-10-22,Moderator
Biden,"What I would say is Im going to shut down the virus, not the country. Its his ineptitude that caused the country to have to shut down in large part  why businesses have gone under, why schools are closed, why so many people have lost their living and why theyre concerned. Those other concerns are real. Thats why he should have been  instead of in a sand trap at his golf course  he should have been negotiating with Nancy Pelosi and the rest of the Democrats and Republicans about what to do about the acts they were passing for billions of dollars to make sure people had the capacity.",2020-10-22,Democrat
Welker,Well you havent ruled out more shutdowns.,2020-10-22,Moderator
Biden,"Oh no, Im not shutting down the nation but there are, look, they need standards. The standard is, if you have a reproduction rate in a community thats above a certain level, everybody says, slow up. More social distancing. Do not open bars and do not open gymnasiums. Do not open until you get this under control, under more control. But when you do open, give the people the capacity to be able to open and have the capacity to do it safely. For example schools  schools, they need a lot of money to open. They need to deal with ventilation systems, they need to deal with smaller classes, more teachers, more pods, and hes refused to support that money, or at least up to now.",2020-10-22,Democrat

Welker,"Please, and then I have a follow up.",2020-10-22,Moderator
Trump,"Thank you, and I appreciate that. Look, all he does is talk about shutdowns but forget about him. His democrat governors  Cuomo in New York, you look at whats going on in California, you look at Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Democrats, Democrats all  they are shut down so tight, and theyre dying. Theyre dying. And he supports all these people. All he talks about is shutdowns. No, were not going to shut down, and we have to open our schools. And its like, as an example, I have a young son. He also tested positive. By the time I spoke to the doctor, the second time, he was fine, it just went away. Young people, I guess its their immune system.",2020-10-22,Republican
Welker,"Let me follow up with you, President Trump. Youve demanded schools open in person and insisted they can do it safely. But just yesterday, Boston became the latest city to move its public school system entirely online after a coronavirus spike. What is your message to parents who worry that sending their children to school will endanger not only their kids, but also their teachers and families?",2020-10-22,Moderator
Trump,"I want to open the schools. The transmittal rate to the teachers is very small, but I want to open the schools. We have to open our country. Were not going to have a country. You cant do this, we cant keep this country closed. It is a massive country with a massive economy. People are losing their jobs, theyre committing suicide. Theres depression, alcohol, drugs at a level that nobodys ever seen before. Theres abuse, tremendous abuse. We have to open our country. You know Ive said it often  the cure cannot be worse than the problem itself, and thats whats happening, and he wants to close down. Hell close down the country if one person in our, in our massive bureaucracy says we should close it down.",2020-10-22,Republican
Welker,"Vice President Biden, your response.",2020-10-22,Moderator
Biden,"Simply not true. Were gonna be able to walk and chew gum at the same time. We ought to be able to safely open, but they need resources to open. You need to be able to, for example, if youre gonna open a business, have social distancing within the business. You need to have, if you have a restaurant, you need to have plexiglass dividers so people cannot infect one another. You need to be in a position where you can take testing rapidly and know whether a person is, in fact, infected. You need to be able to trace. You need to be able to provide all the resources that are needed to do this and that is not inconsistent with saying that were going to make sure that we open safely. And by the way, all you teachers out there  not that many of you are going to die, so dont worry about it. Dont worry about it. Come on.",2020-10-22,Democrat
Welker,"President Trump, let me follow up with you quickly.",2020-10-22,Moderator
Trump,"By the way,I will say this, if you go and look at whats happened to New York, its a ghost town. Its a ghost town. And when you talk about plexiglass  these are restaurants that are dying. These are businesses with no money. Putting up plexiglass is unbelievably expensive, and its not the answer. I mean, youre going to sit there in a cubicle wrapped around with plastic? These are businesses that are dying, Joe, you cant do that to people, you just cant. Take a look at New York and whats happened to my wonderful city. For so many years, I loved it. It was vibrant. Its dying. Everyones leaving New York.",2020-10-22,Republican

And I dont look at this in terms of the way he does, blue states and red states. Theyre all the United States. And look at the states that are having such a spike in the coronavirus. Theyre the red states. They are the states in the Midwest, they are the states in the upper Midwest, thats where the spike is occurring significantly, but theyre all Americans. Theyre all Americans and what we have to do is say, wear these masks, number one, make sure we get the help that the businesses need. The moneys already been passed to do that. Its been out there since the beginning of the summer and nothings happened.",2020-10-22,Democrat

Trump,"When you say spike, take a look at whats happening in Pennsylvania, where theyve had it closed. Take a look at whats happening with your friend in Michigan, where her husbands the only one allowed to do anything. Its been like a prison. Now it was just ruled unconstitutional. Take a look at North Carolina. Theyre having spikes and theyve been closed, and theyre getting killed financially. We cant let that happen, Joe, you cant let that happen. We have to open up and we understand the disease, we have to protect our seniors, we have to protect our elderly, we have to protect, especially, our seniors with heart problems and diabetes problems, and we will protect them. We have the best testing in the world by far. Thats why we have so many cases.",2020-10-22,Republican
Welker,"Let me follow up with you before we move on to our next section. President Trump, this week you called Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nations best known infectious disease expert, a disaster. You described him and other medical experts as idiots. If youre not listening to them, who are you listening to?",2020-10-22,Moderator
Trump,"Im listening to all of them, including Anthony. I get along very well with Anthony. But he did say, dont wear masks. He did say, as you know, this is not going to be a problem. I think hes a Democrat, but thats okay. He said, this is not going to be a problem. We are not going to have a problem at all. When Joe says that, I said  Anthony Fauci said and others and many others. And Im not knocking him. Nobody knew. Look, nobody knew what this thing was, nobody knew where it was coming from, what it was. Weve learned a lot, but Anthony said, dont wear masks. Now he wants to wear masks. Anthony also said, if you look back, exact words, heres his exact words: This is no problem, this is going to go away soon. So hes allowed to make mistakes, he happens to be a good person.",2020-10-22,Republican
Welker,"Vice President Biden, your response, quickly and then were going to move on to the next section.",2020-10-22,Moderator
Biden,"My response is that, think about what the President knew in January and didnt tell the American people. He was told this was a serious virus that spread in the air, and it was much worse than  much worse  than the flu. He went on record and said to one of your colleagues, recorded, that in fact he knew how dangerous it was but he didnt want to tell us, didnt want to tell us because he didnt want us to panic. He didnt want us  Americans dont panic. He panicked. But, guess what, in the meantime, we find out in the New York Times the other day that in fact, his folks went to Wall Street and said, this is a really dangerous thing, and a memo out of that meeting  not from his administration, but from some of the brokers  said, sell short, because we gotta get moving. Its a dangerous problem.",2020-10-22,Democrat

And every time you raise money, deals are made, Joe. I could raise so much more money. As president and as somebody that knows most of those people, I could call the heads of Wall Street, the heads of every company in America, I would blow away every record. But I dont want to do that because it puts me in a bad position. And then you bring up Wall Street? You shouldnt be bringing up Wall Street. Because youre the one that takes the money from Wall Street, not me. I could blow away your records like you wouldnt believe. We dont need money. We have plenty of money. In fact, we beat Hillary Clinton with a tiny fraction of the money that she was able to get. Dont tell me about Wall Street.",2020-10-22,Republican

Welker,"All right, were gonna move on to our next section which is national security. And I do want to start with the security of our elections and some breaking news from overnight. Just last night, top intelligence officials confirmed again that both Russia and Iran are working to influence this election. Both countries have obtained U.S. voter registration information, these officials say, and Iran sent intimidating messages to Florida voters. This question goes to you, Mr. Vice President, what would you do to put an end to this threat? You have two minutes, uninterrupted.",2020-10-22,Moderator
Biden,"I made it clear. And I asked everyone else to take the pledge. I made it clear that any country, no matter who it is, that interferes in American elections will pay a price. They will pay a price. It has been overwhelmingly clear in this election  I wont even get into the last one  this election, that Russia has been involved. China has been involved to some degree, and now we learned that, that Iran is involved. They will pay a price if Im elected. Theyre interfering with American sovereignty. Thats whats going on right now. Theyre interfering with American sovereignty. And to the best of my knowledge, I dont think the President has said anything to Putin about it. I dont think hes talking to him a lot. I dont think hes said a word. I dont know why he hasnt said a word to Putin about it. And I dont know what he has recently said, if anything, to the Iranians. My guess is hed probably be more outspoken with regard to the Iranians. But the point is this, folks. We are in a situation where we have foreign countries trying to interfere in the outcome of our election. His own national security advisor told him that what is happening with his buddy  well, I wont, I shouldnt  I will  his buddy Rudy Giuliani. Hes being used as a Russian pawn. Hes being fed information that is Russian, that is not true. And then what happens? Nothing happens. And then you find out that everything is going on here about Russia is wanting to make sure that I do not get elected the next President of the United States because they know I know them, and they know me. I dont understand why this President is unwilling to take on Putin when hes actually paying bounties to kill American soldiers in Afghanistan, when hes engaged in activities that are trying to destabilize all of NATO. I dont know why he doesnt do it but its worth asking the question. Why isnt that being done? Any country that interferes with us will, in fact, pay a price because theyre affecting our sovereignty.",2020-10-22,Democrat
Welker,"President Trump, same question to you. Let me, let me ask the question. Youre gonna have two minutes to respond for two elections in a row now there has been substantial interference from foreign adversaries. What would you do in your next term to put an end to this? Two minutes, uninterrupted.",2020-10-22,Moderator
Trump,"Well, let me respond to the first part, as Joe answered. Joe got three and a half million dollars from Russia. And it came through Putin, because he was very friendly with the former mayor of Moscow and it was the mayor of Moscows wife. You got three and a half million dollars. Your family got three and a half million dollars and you know someday, youre gonna have to explain  why did you get three and a half? I never got any money from Russia. I dont get money from Russia. Now, about your thing last night, I knew all about that, and through John  who is John Radcliffe, who is fantastic, DNI  he said, the one thing thats common to both of them, they both want you to lose. Because there has been nobody tougher to Russia. Between the sanctions, nobody tougher than me on Russia. Between the sanctions between all of what Ive done with NATO. You know, Ive got the NATO countries to put up an extra 130 billion, going to $420 billion a year, thats to guard against Russia. I sold  while he was selling pillows and sheets  I sold tank busters to Ukraine. There has been nobody tougher on Russia than Donald Trump. And Ill tell you, they were so bad. They took over the, the submarine port. You remember that very well during your term, during you and Barack Obama. They took over a big part of what should have been Ukraine. You handed it to them. But you were getting a lot of money from Russia. They were paying you a lot of money and they probably still are, but now, with what came out today, its even worse. All of the emails, the emails are horrible. The emails of the kind of money that you were raking in, you and your family. And Joe, you were vice president when some of this was happening. And it should have never happened. And I think you owe an explanation to the American people. Why is it, somebody just had a news conference a little while ago, who was essentially supposed to work with you and your family, but what he said was damning. And regardless of me, I think you have to clean it up and talk to the American people. Maybe you can do it right now.",2020-10-22,Republican

Go look at them. 22 years of my tax returns. You have not released a single solitary year of your tax return. What are you hiding? Why are you unwilling? The foreign countries are paying you a lot. Russia is paying you a lot. China is paying a lot. And your hotels and all your businesses all around the country, all around the world.

But much more importantly than that, people were saying $750. I asked them a week ago, I said, what did I pay? They said, sir, you pre-paid tens of millions of dollars. I prepaid my tax. Tens. Over the last number of years. Tens of millions of dollars, I prepaid, because at some point, they think, its an estimate. They think I may have to pay tax. So, I already prepaid it.

I dont make money from Russia. You made three and a half million dollars, Joe, and your son gave you. They even have a statement that we have to give 10% to the big man. Youre the big man, I think. I dont know, maybe youre not. But youre the big man, I think. Your son said we have to give 10% to the big man. Joe, whats that all about? Its terrible.",2020-10-22,Republican

As soon as were completed with the deal, I want to release it. But I have paid millions and millions of dollars. And its worse than paying. I paid in advance.

Nobody knows, Mr. President, what they do know is youre not paying your taxes or youre paying taxes that are so low. When last time he said what he paid, he said, I only pay that little because Im smart. I know how to game the system. Come on, come on, folks.",2020-10-22,Democrat

Trump,"I was put through a phony witch hunt for three years. It started before I even got elected. They spied on my campaign. No president should ever have to go through what I went through. Let me just say this. Mueller and 18 angry Democrats, and FBI agents all over the place spent $48 million. They went through everything I had, including my tax returns, and they found absolutely no collusion and nothing wrong. $48 million. I guarantee you, if I spent 1 million on you Joe, I could find plenty wrong, because the kind of things that youve done and the kind of monies that your family has taken  I mean, your brother made money in Iraq, millions of dollars. Your other brother made a fortune, and its all through you, Joe. And they say you get some of it. And you do live very well. You have houses all over the place. You live very well.",2020-10-22,Republican

Vice President Biden, there have been questions about the work your son has done in China, and for a Ukrainian energy company when you were Vice President. In retrospect, was anything about those relationships inappropriate or unethical?",2020-10-22,Moderator
Biden,"Nothing was unethical. Heres what the deal. With regard to Ukraine, we had this whole question about whether or not, because he was on the board, I later learned, of Burisma, a company, that somehow I had done something wrong. Yet every single solitary person, when he was going through his impeachment, testifying under oath who worked for him, said I did my job impeccably. I carried out US policy. Not one, single, solitary thing was out of line. Not a single thing, number one. Number two, the guy who got in trouble in Ukraine was this guy, trying to bribe the Ukrainian government to say something negative about me, which they would not do, and did not do, because it never, ever, ever happened. My son has not made money in terms of this thing about  what are you talking about  China. I have not had it. The only guy that made money from China is this guy. Hes the only one.

The bank account youre referring to  which is, everybody knows about it, its listed  the bank account was in 2013. Thats what it was. It was opened. It was closed in 2015, I believe, and then I decided, because I was going to do, I was thinking about doing a deal in China, like millions of other people, I was thinking about it.

If you were president, would you make China pay and please be specific, what would that look like?",2020-10-22,Moderator

We are making sure that in order to do business in China, you have to give all your intellectual property. You have to get/have a partner in China, it is 51%. We would not do that at all, number one. Number two, were in a situation where China would have to play by the rules internationally as well. When I met with Xi, and when I was still vice president, he said were setting up air identification zones in the South China Sea, you cant fly through them. I said, were gonna fly through them. We just flew B52/B1 bombers through it. Were not going to pay attention. They have to play by the rules, and whats he do? He embraces guys like the thugs like in North Korea, and, and, and the Chinese president and Putin and others, and he pokes his finger in the eye of all our friends, all of our allies. We make up only  were 25%. 25% of the worlds economy. We need to be having the rest of our friends with us, saying to China, these are the rules. You play by them or youre going to pay the price for not playing by them, economically. Thats the way I will run it.

Welker,"Were gonna talk about North Korea now. President Trump, youve met with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un three times. Youve talked about your beautiful letters with him, youve touted the fact that there hasnt been a war or a long range missile test, and yet North Korea recently rolled out its biggest ever intercontinental ballistic missile and continues to develop its nuclear arsenal. Do you see that as a betrayal of the relationship you forged? Just 30 seconds here because we need to get on to the next topic.",2020-10-22,Moderator
Trump,"So, when I met with Barack Obama, we sat in the White House, right at the beginning had a great conversation, was supposed to be 15 minutes and it was well over an hour. He said the biggest problem we have is North Korea. He indicated we will be in a war with North Korea. Guess what, it would be a nuclear war, and he does have plenty of nuclear capability. In the meantime, I have a very good relationship with him, different kind of a guy but he probably thinks the same thing about me. We have a different kind of a relationship. We have a very good relationship, and theres no war. And you know, about two months ago, he broke into a certain area. They said, oh theres going to be trouble. I said, No, theyre not. Because hes not going to do that. And I was right. Look, instead of being in a war where millions of people  Seoul, you know, is 25 miles away, millions and millions, 32 million people in Seoul  millions of people would be dead right now. We dont have a war, and I have a good relationship.",2020-10-22,Republican
Welker,"Vice President Biden to you, North Korea conducted four nuclear tests under the Obama administration. Why do you think you would be able to rein in this persistent threat?",2020-10-22,Moderator
Biden,"Because Id make it clear, which we were making clear to China, they had to be part of the deal, because heres the root. I made it clear, as a spokesperson for the administration when I went to China, that they said, Why are you moving your missile defense up so close? Why are you moving more forces here? Why are you continuing to do military maneuvers with South Korea? I said, Because North Korea is a problem. And were going to continue to do it so we can control them. Were going to make sure we can control them and make sure they cannot hurt us. And so if you want to do something about it, step up and help. If not, its going to continue. What has he done? Hes legitimized North Korea, hes talked about his good buddy whos a thug, a thug, and he talks about how were better off, and they have much more capable missiles, able to reach U.S. territory, much more easily than ever did before.",2020-10-22,Democrat

Welker,"Okay, lets move on to American families and the economy. One of the issues thats most important to them is health care, as you both know. Today, there was a key vote on a new Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett, and healthcare is at the center of her confirmation fight. Over 20 million Americans get their health insurance through the Affordable Care Act. Its headed to the Supreme Court, and your administration, Mr. President, is advocating for the court to overturn it. If the Supreme Court does overturn that law, those 20 million Americans could lose their health insurance almost overnight. So what would you do if those people have their health insurance taken away? You have two minutes uninterrupted.",2020-10-22,Moderator
Trump,"First of all, Ive already done something that nobody thought was possible. Through the legislature, I terminated the individual mandate. That is the worst part of Obamacare, as we call it. The individual mandate  where you have to pay a fortune for the privilege of not having to pay for bad health insurance. I terminated it; its gone. Now its in court, because Obamacare is no good. But then I made a decision, Run it as well as you can  to my people, great people  Run it as well as you can. I could have gone the other route and made everybody very unhappy. They ran it. Premiums are down, everythings down. Heres the problem. No matter how well you run it, its no good. What wed like to do is terminate it. We have the individual mandate done. I dont know that its going to work. If we dont win, we will have to run it and well have Obamacare, but it will be better run. But it no longer is Obamacare. Because without the individual mandate, its much different. Pre-existing conditions will always stay. What I would like to do is a much better health care, much better. Well always protect people with pre-existing  so Id like to terminate Obamacare, come up with a brand new beautiful health care. The Democrats will do it because therell be tremendous pressure on them. And we might even have the House by that time. And I think were going to win the House, okay? Youll see, but I think were gonna win the House. But come up with a better health care, always protecting people with pre-existing conditions  and one thing very important. We have 180 million people out there that have great private health care, far more than were talking about with Obamacare. Joe Biden is going to terminate all of those policies. These are people that love their health care, people that have been successful  middle income people  been successful. They have 180 million plans, 180 million people, families under what he wants to do, which will basically be socialized medicine. He wont even have a choice. They want to terminate 180 million plans. We have done an incredible job on health care. And were going to do even better.",2020-10-22,Republican
Welker,"OK. Vice President Biden, yes, this is for you. Your health care plan calls for building on Obamacare. So my question is, what is your plan if the law is ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court? You have two minutes uninterrupted.",2020-10-22,Moderator
Biden,"What Im going to do is pass Obamacare with a public option  become Bidencare. Public option is an option that says that if you, in fact, do not have the wherewithal to be  if you qualify for Medicaid, and you do not have the wherewithal in your state to get Medicaid, you automatically are enrolled, providing competition for insurance companies. Thats whats going to happen. Secondly, were going to make sure we reduce the premiums and reduce drug prices by making sure that theres competition that doesnt exist now by allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices with the insurance companies. Thirdly, the idea that I want to eliminate private insurance  the reason why I had such a fight for, with 20 candidates for the nomination, was I support private insurance. Thats why I did not  not one single person, private insurance, would lose their insurance under my plan, nor did they under Obamacare. They did not lose their insurance, unless they chose they wanted to go to something else. Lastly, were going to make sure were in a situation that we actually protect pre-existing  theres no way he can protect pre-existing conditions. None, zero, you cant do it in the ether. Hes been talking about this for a long time. There is no  hes never come up with a plan. I guess were gonna get the pre-existing condition plan the same time we get the infrastructure plan that we waited since 17, 18, 19, 20. The fact  I still have a little, a few more minutes, I know youre getting anxious  the fact is that hes already cost the American people because of his terrible handling of the COVID virus and economic spillover. 10 million people have lost their private insurance, and he wants to take away 22 million more people who have been under Obamacare, and over 110 million people with pre-existing conditions. And all the people from COVID are going to have pre-existing conditions. What are they gonna do?",2020-10-22,Democrat
Welker,"I have a follow up for you, Vice President Biden, it relates to something that President Trump said. Hes accusing you of wanting socialized medicine. What do you say to people who have concerns that your health care plan, which includes a government insurance option, takes the country one step closer to a health care system run entirely by the government? Whats your response to that?",2020-10-22,Moderator
Biden,"I say, its ridiculous. Its like saying that, you know, were the idea that, the fact that theres a public option that people can choose, that makes it a socialist plan? Look, the difference between the president  I think health care is not a privilege, its a right. Everyone should have the right to have affordable health care. And I am very proud of my plan. Its gotten endorsed by all the major labor unions as well as, as well as a whole range of other people who in fact, are concerned in the medical field. This is something thats going to save peoples lives. And this is going to give some people an opportunity, an opportunity to have health care for their children, how many of you home are worried and rolling around in bed at night wondering what in Gods name are you going to do if you get sick? Because youve lost your home insurance, your health insurance, your companys gone under. We have to provide health insurance for people at an affordable rate, and thats what Id do.",2020-10-22,Democrat

And its not that he wants it, his vice president  I mean, she is more liberal than Bernie Sanders and wants it even more. Bernie Sanders wants it, the Democrats want it. Youre going to have socialized medicine. Just like you went on with fracking  Were not going to have fracking, were going to stop fracking, were going to stop fracking. Then he goes to Pennsylvania after he gets the nomination  where he got very lucky to get it. And he goes to Pennsylvania, and he says, Oh, were gonna have fracking.

What were going to do is going to cost some money; its going to cost over $750 billion over 10 years to do it.

Trump,Go ahead.,2020-10-22,Republican
Welker,"Alright. Lets talk about our next section, which is race in America. And I want to talk about the way Black and Brown Americans experience race in this country. Part of that experience is something called the talk. It happens regardless of class and income  parents who feel they have no choice but to prepare their children for the chance that they could be targeted, including by the police, for no reason other than the color of their skin. Mr. Vice President, in the next two minutes, I want you to speak directly to these families. Do you understand why these parents fear for their children?",2020-10-22,Moderator
Biden,"I do. I do. You know, my daughter is a social worker. And shes written a lot about this. She has a graduate degree from the University of Pennsylvania in social work. And you know, one of the reasons why I ended up working on the East side of Wilmington, Delaware, which is 90 percent African American, was to learn more about what was going on. What I didnt  I never had to tell my daughter if shes pulled over, make sure she puts, for a traffic stop, put both hands on top of the wheel. And dont reach for the glove box because someone may shoot you. But a Black parent, no matter how wealthy or how poor they are, has to teach their child, when youre walking down the street, dont have a hoodie on when you go across the street, making sure that you, in fact, if you get pulled over, yes sir, no sir, hands on top of the wheel. Because you are in fact, a victim, whether youre a person making 300,000  $300,000-a-year person, or someone whos on food stamps. The fact of the matter is there is institutional racism in America. And we have always said  weve never lived up to it. That we hold these truths to be self-evident, all men and women are created equal. But guess what  we have never ever lived up to it. But we have constantly been moving the needle further and further to inclusion, not exclusion. This is the first president come along and says thats the end of that. Were not going to do that anymore. We have to provide for economic opportunity, better education, better health care, better access to schooling, better access to opportunity to borrow money to start businesses. All the things we can do. And Ive laid out a clear plan as to how to do those things. Just to give people a shot. Its about accumulating the ability to have wealth, as well as it is to be free from violence.",2020-10-22,Democrat
Welker,"President Trump, same question to you. And let me remind you of the question, I would like you to speak directly to these families. Do you understand why these parents fear for their children?",2020-10-22,Moderator
Trump,"Yes, I do. And again, hes been in government 47 years. He never did a thing except in 1994, when he did such harm to the Black community. And they were called, and he called them, super predators. And he said that, he said it  super predators. And they have never lived that down. 1994, your crime bill, the super predators. Nobody has done more for the Black community than Donald Trump. And if you look, with the exception of Abraham Lincolnpossible exception, but the exception of Abraham Lincoln, nobody has done what Ive done. Criminal justice reform, Obama and Joe didnt do it. I dont even think they tried because they had no chance at doing it. They might have wanted to do it. But if you had to see the arms I had a twist to get that done, it was not a pretty picture. And everybody knows it including some very liberal people that cried in my officethey cried in the Oval Office. Two weeks later, theyre out saying, Gee, we have to defeat him. Criminal justice reform, prison reform, opportunity zones with Tim Scott, a great senator from South Carolina. He came in with this incredible idea for opportunity zones. Its one of the most successful programs. People dont talk about it. Tremendous investment is being made. Biggest beneficiary, the Black and Hispanic communities and then historically Black colleges and universities. After three years of coming to the office, I love some of those guys, they were great, they came into the office. And they said I said, What are you doing after three years? I said, Why do you keep coming back? Because we have no funding. I said, You dont have to come back every year, We have to come back, because President Obama would never give them long term funding. And I did. Ten-year, long term funding, and I gave them more money than they asked for, because I said, I think you need more. And I said, The only bad part about this is I may never see you again, because I got very friendly with them and they like me and I like them. But I saved historically black colleges and universities.",2020-10-22,Republican
Welker,"OK. And were going to talk about both of your records, but your response to that Vice President?",2020-10-22,Moderator
Biden,"My response to that is I never, ever said what he accused me of saying. The fact of the matter is, in 2000 though, after the crime bill had been in the law for a while, this is the guy who said, The problem with the crime bill, theres not enough people in jail. Theres not enough people in jail, and go on my website, get the quote, the date when he said it, not enough people. He talked about marauding gangs, young gangs, the people who are going to maraud our cities. This is a guy who when the Central Park five, five innocent Black kids, he continued to push for making sure that they got the death penalty. None of them were  none of them were guilty of what the crime, of the crimes that were suggested. Look, and talk about he, granted, he did in fact let 20 people  he commuted 20 peoples sentences. We commuted over 1,000 peoples sentences. Over 1,000. The very law hes talking about is a law that, in fact, initiated by Barack Obama. And secondly, were in a situation here where we  the federal prison system was reduced by 38,000 people under our administration. And one of these things we should be doing is there should be no, no minimum mandatories in the law. Thats why Im offering $20 billion to states to change their state laws to eliminate minimum mandatories and set up drug courts. No one should be going to jail because they have a drug problem. They should be going to rehabilitation, not to jail. We should fundamentally change the system and thats what Im going to do.",2020-10-22,Democrat

Welker,"Were going to continue on the issue of race. Mr. President, youve described the Black Lives Matter movement as a symbol of hate. Youve shared a video of a man chanting white power to millions of your supporters. Youve said that Black professional athletes exercising their first amendment rights should be fired. What do you say to Americans who say that kind of language from a president is contributing to a climate of hate and racial strife?",2020-10-22,Moderator

Biden,"Abraham Lincoln here is one of the most racist presidents weve had in modern history. He pours fuel on every single racist fire, every single one. He started off his campaign coming down the escalator saying hes gonna get rid of those Mexican rapists. Hes banned Muslims because theyre Muslims.

Welker,"Vice President Biden, let me give you a chance to respond within this context. Crime bills that you supported in the 80s and 90s contributed to the incarceration of tens of thousands of young Black men who had small amounts of drugs in their possession. They are sons, they are brothers, they are fathers, theyre uncles whose families are still to this day, some of them, suffering the consequences. So speak to those families, why should they vote for you?",2020-10-22,Moderator
Biden,"One of the things is that in the 80s, we passed 100%, all 100 senators voted for it, a bill on drugs and how to deal with drugs. It was a mistake. Ive been trying to change it since then, particularly the portion on cocaine. Thats why Ive been arguing that, in fact, we should not send anyone to jail for a pure drug offense. They should be going into treatment across the board. Thats what we should be spending money on. Thats why I set up drug courts which were never funded by Republican friends. They should not be going to jail for a drug or an alcohol problem. They should be going into treatment. Treatment. Thats what weve been trying to do. Thats what Im going to get done because the American people have now seen that in fact, it was a mistake to pass those laws related to drugs. But they were not in the crime bill.",2020-10-22,Democrat
Trump,"But why didnt he get it done? See, its all talk, no action with these politicians. Why didnt he get it done? Thats what Im gonna do when I become president.

We have the best, lowest number in carbon emissions, which is a big standard that I noticed Obama goes with all the time. Not Joe. I havent heard Joe use the term because Im not sure he knows what it represents or means, but I have heard Obama use it. And we have the best carbon emission numbers that weve had in 35 years. Under this administration, we are working so well with industry, but heres what we cant do  Look at China, how filthy it is. Look at Russia. Look at India. Its filthy. The air is filthy. The Paris Accord, I took us out because we were going to have to spend trillions of dollars and we were treated very unfairly. When they put us in there, they did us a great disservice. They were going to take away our businesses. I will not sacrifice tens of millions of jobs, thousands and thousands of companies because of the Paris Accord. It was so unfair. China doesnt kick in until 2030. Russia goes back to a low standard and we kicked in right away. It would have been  It would have been It would have destroyed our businesses. So, you ready?

Four more years of this man eliminating all the regulations that were put in by us to clean up the climate, to clean up  to limit the  limit of emissions, will put us in a position where were going to be in real trouble. Heres where we have a great opportunity. I was able to get both all the environmental organizations as well as labor, the people worried about jobs, to support my climate plan. Because what it does, it will create millions of new, good-paying jobs. Were going to invest in, for example, 500,000  50,000, excuse me, 50,000 charging stations on our highways so that we can own the electric car market in the future. In the meantime, Chinas doing that. Were going to be in a position where were going to see to it that were going to take 4 million existing billion, buildings and 2 million existing homes and retrofit them so they dont leak as much energy, saving hundreds of millions of barrels of oil in the process and creating significant number of jobs. And by the way, the whole idea of what this is all going to do, its going to create millions of jobs and its going to clean the environment. Our health and our jobs are at stake. Thats whats happening. And what  right now, by the way, Wall Street firm has indicated that my plan  my plan will, in fact, create 18.6 million jobs, 7 million more than his.

I mean, shes got a good line of stuff, but she knows nothing about the climate. And theyre all hopping through hoops for AOC+3. Look, their real plan costs $100 trillion. If we had the best year in the history of our country for 100 years, we would not even come close to a number like that. When he says buildings, they want to take buildings down because they want to make bigger windows into smaller windows. As far as theyre concerned, if you had no window it would be a lovely thing. This is the craziest plan that anybody has ever seen. And this wasnt done by smart people. This wasnt done by anybody. Frankly, I dont even know how it can be good politically.

What I will do with fracking over time is make sure that we can capture the emissions from the fracking. Capture the emissions from gas. We can do that and we can do that by investing money into  its a transition to that.",2020-10-22,Democrat

President Trump, people of color are much more likely to live near oil refineries and chemical plants. In Texas there are families who worry the plants near them are making them sick.

If you look at the kind of numbers that we produce for Hispanic, or Black, or Asian, its nine times greater, the percentage gain than it was under  in three years  than it was under eight years of the two of them, to put it nicely. Nine times more. Now, somebody lives  I have not heard the numbers or the statistics that youre saying  but theyre making a tremendous amount of money. Economically, we saved it. And I saved it again a number of months ago when oil was crashing because of the pandemic. We saved it.

Chemical plants and oil plants and refineries that pollute. I used to live near that when I was growing up in Claymont, Delaware. And all the more oil refineries in Marcus Hook and the Delaware River than there is any place, including in Houston at the time. When my mom would get in the car when there were first frost to drive me to school, turned on the windshield wipers thered be oil slick in the window. Thats why so many people in my state were dying and getting cancer. The fact is those frontline communities, it doesnt matter what youre paying them. It matters how you keep them safe.

Trump,"We have to make our country totally successful, as it was prior to the plague coming in from China. Now were rebuilding it and were doing record numbers, 11.4 million jobs in a short period of time etc. But, I will tell you, go back before the plague came in, just before, I was getting calls from people that were not normally people that would call me. They wanted to get together. We had the best Black unemployment numbers in the history of our country, Hispanic, women, Asian, people with diplomas, with no diplomas, MIT graduates, number one in the class  everybody had the best numbers. And you know what? The other side wanted to get together. They wanted to unify. Success is going to bring us together. We are on the road to success. But Im cutting taxes and he wants to raise everybodys taxes. And he wants to put new regulations on everything. He will kill it. If he gets in, you will have a depression, the likes of which youve never seen. Your 401Ks will go to hell and itll be a very, very sad day for this country.",2020-10-22,Republican

Were going to move. Were going to choose science over fiction. Were going to choose hope over fear. Were going to choose to move forward because we have enormous opportunities, enormous opportunities to make things better. We can grow this economy. We can deal with systemic racism. At the same time, we can make sure that our economy is being run, and moved, and motivated by clean energy, creating millions of new jobs. And thats the fact, thats what were going to do. And Im going to say, as I said at the beginning, what is on the ballot here is the character of this country. Decency. Honor. Respect. Treating people with dignity. Making sure that everyone has an even chance. Now, Im going to make sure you get that. You havent been getting it the last four years.",2020-10-22,Democrat

Lehrer,"Good evening from the Ford Center for the Performing Arts at the University of Mississippi in Oxford. Im Jim Lehrer of the NewsHour on PBS, and I welcome you to the first of the 2008 presidential debates between the Republican nominee, Senator John McCain of Arizona, and the Democratic nominee, Senator Barack Obama of Illinois. The Commission on Presidential Debates is the sponsor of this event and the three other presidential and vice presidential debates coming in October. Tonights will primarily be about foreign policy and national security, which, by definition, includes the global financial crisis. It will be divided roughly into nine-minute segments. Direct exchanges between the candidates and moderator follow-ups are permitted after each candidate has two minutes to answer the lead question in an order determined by a coin toss. The specific subjects and questions were chosen by me. They have not been shared or cleared with anyone. The audience here in the hall has promised to remain silent, no cheers, no applause, no noise of any kind, except right now, as we welcome Senators Obama and McCain. Let me begin with something General Eisenhower said in his 1952 presidential campaign. Quote, We must achieve both security and solvency. In fact, the foundation of military strength is economic strength, end quote. With that in mind, the first lead question. First response to you, Senator Obama. You have two minutes.",2008-09-26,Moderator
Obama,"Well, thank you very much, Jim, and thanks to the commission and the University of Mississippi, Ole Miss, for hosting us tonight. I cant think of a more important time for us to talk about the future of the country. You know, we are at a defining moment in our history. Our nation is involved in two wars, and we are going through the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. And although weve heard a lot about Wall Street, those of you on Main Street I think have been struggling for a while, and you recognize that this could have an impact on all sectors of the economy. So we have to move swiftly, and we have to move wisely. And Ive put forward a series of proposals that make sure that we protect taxpayers as we engage in this important rescue effort. Number one, weve got to make sure that weve got oversight over this whole process; $700 billion, potentially, is a lot of money. Number two, weve got to make sure that taxpayers, when they are putting their money at risk, have the possibility of getting that money back and gains, if the market  and when the market returns. Number three, weve got to make sure that none of that money is going to pad CEO bank accounts or to promote golden parachutes. And, number four, weve got to make sure that were helping homeowners, because the root problem here has to do with the foreclosures that are taking place all across the country. Now, we also have to recognize that this is a final verdict on eight years of failed economic policies promoted by George Bush, supported by Senator McCain, a theory that basically says that we can shred regulations and consumer protections and give more and more to the most, and somehow prosperity will trickle down. It hasnt worked. And I think that the fundamentals of the economy have to be measured by whether or not the middle class is getting a fair shake. Thats why Im running for president, and thats what I hope were going to be talking about tonight.",2008-09-26,Democrat
Lehrer,"Senator McCain, two minutes.",2008-09-26,Moderator
Mccain,"Well, thank you, Jim. And thanks to everybody. And I do have a sad note tonight. Senator Kennedy is in the hospital. Hes a dear and beloved friend to all of us. Our thoughts and prayers go out to the lion of the Senate. I also want to thank the University of Mississippi for hosting us tonight. And, Jim, I  Ive been not feeling too great about a lot of things lately. So have a lot of Americans who are facing challenges. But Im feeling a little better tonight, and Ill tell you why. Because as were here tonight in this debate, we are seeing, for the first time in a long time, Republicans and Democrats together, sitting down, trying to work out a solution to this fiscal crisis that were in. And have no doubt about the magnitude of this crisis. And were not talking about failure of institutions on Wall Street. Were talking about failures on Main Street, and people who will lose their jobs, and their credits, and their homes, if we dont fix the greatest fiscal crisis, probably in  certainly in our time, and Ive been around a little while. But the point is  the point is, we have finally seen Republicans and Democrats sitting down and negotiating together and coming up with a package. This package has transparency in it. It has to have accountability and oversight. It has to have options for loans to failing businesses, rather than the government taking over those loans. We have to  it has to have a package with a number of other essential elements to it. And, yes, I went back to Washington, and I met with my Republicans in the House of Representatives. And they werent part of the negotiations, and I understand that. And it was the House Republicans that decided that they would be part of the solution to this problem. But I want to emphasize one point to all Americans tonight. This isnt the beginning of the end of this crisis. This is the end of the beginning, if we come out with a package that will keep these institutions stable. And weve got a lot of work to do. And weve got to create jobs. And one of the areas, of course, is to eliminate our dependence on foreign oil.",2008-09-26,Republican
Lehrer,"All right, lets go back to my question. How do you all stand on the recovery plan? And talk to each other about it. Weve got five minutes. We can negotiate a deal right here.",2008-09-26,Moderator
Obama,"We havent seen the language yet. And I do think that theres constructive work being done out there. So, for the viewers who are watching, I am optimistic about the capacity of us to come together with a plan. Two years ago, I warned that, because of the subprime lending mess, because of the lax regulation, that we were potentially going to have a problem and tried to stop some of the abuses in mortgages that were taking place at the time. Last year, I wrote to the secretary of the Treasury to make sure that he understood the magnitude of this problem and to call on him to bring all the stakeholders together to try to deal with it. So  so the question, I think, that weve got to ask ourselves is, yes, weve got to solve this problem short term. And we are going to have to intervene; theres no doubt about that. But were also going to have to look at, how is it that we shredded so many regulations? We did not set up a 21st-century regulatory framework to deal with these problems. And that in part has to do with an economic philosophy that says that regulation is always bad.",2008-09-26,Democrat
Lehrer,"Are you going to vote for the plan, Senator McCain?",2008-09-26,Moderator
Mccain,I  I hope so. And I,2008-09-26,Republican
Lehrer,As a United States senator,2008-09-26,Moderator
Mccain,Sure.,2008-09-26,Republican
Lehrer, youre going to vote for the plan?,2008-09-26,Moderator
Mccain,"Sure. But  but let me  let me point out, I also warned about Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and warned about corporate greed and excess, and CEO pay, and all that. A lot of us saw this train wreck coming. But theres also the issue of responsibility. Youve mentioned President Dwight David Eisenhower. President Eisenhower, on the night before the Normandy invasion, went into his room, and he wrote out two letters. One of them was a letter congratulating the great members of the military and allies that had conducted and succeeded in the greatest invasion in history, still to this day, and forever. And he wrote out another letter, and that was a letter of resignation from the United States Army for the failure of the landings at Normandy. Somehow weve lost that accountability. Ive been heavily criticized because I called for the resignation of the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Weve got to start also holding people accountable, and weve got to reward people who succeed. But somehow in Washington today  and Im afraid on Wall Street  greed is rewarded, excess is rewarded, and corruption  or certainly failure to carry out our responsibility is rewarded. As president of the United States, people are going to be held accountable in my administration. And I promise you that that will happen.",2008-09-26,Republican
Lehrer,"Do you have something directly to say, Senator Obama, to Senator McCain about what he just said?",2008-09-26,Moderator
Obama,"Well, I think Senator McCains absolutely right that we need more responsibility, but we need it not just when theres a crisis. I mean, weve had years in which the reigning economic ideology has been whats good for Wall Street, but not whats good for Main Street. And there are folks out there whove been struggling before this crisis took place. And thats why its so important, as we solve this short-term problem, that we look at some of the underlying issues that have led to wages and incomes for ordinary Americans to go down, the  a health care system that is broken, energy policies that are not working, because, you know, 10 days ago, John said that the fundamentals of the economy are sound.",2008-09-26,Democrat

Lehrer,Im just determined to get you all to talk to each other. Im going to try.,2008-09-26,Moderator
Obama,"The  and I just fundamentally disagree. And unless we are holding ourselves accountable day in, day out, not just when theres a crisis for folks who have power and influence and can hire lobbyists, but for the nurse, the teacher, the police officer, who, frankly, at the end of each month, theyve got a little financial crisis going on. Theyre having to take out extra debt just to make their mortgage payments. We havent been paying attention to them. And if you look at our tax policies, its a classic example.",2008-09-26,Democrat
Lehrer,"So, Senator McCain, do you agree with what Senator Obama just said? And, if you dont, tell him what you disagree with.",2008-09-26,Moderator
Mccain,"No, I  look, weve got to fix the system. Weve got fundamental problems in the system. And Main Street is paying a penalty for the excesses and greed in Washington, D.C., and in the Wall Street. So theres no doubt that we have a long way to go. And, obviously, stricter interpretation and consolidation of the various regulatory agencies that werent doing their job, that has brought on this crisis. But I have a fundamental belief in the goodness and strength of the American worker. And the American worker is the most productive, the most innovative. America is still the greatest producer, exporter and importer. But weve got to get through these times, but I have a fundamental belief in the United States of America. And I still believe, under the right leadership, our best days are ahead of us.",2008-09-26,Republican
Lehrer,"All right, lets go to the next lead question, which is essentially following up on this same subject.",2008-09-26,Moderator
Mccain,"Well, the first thing we have to do is get spending under control in Washington. Its completely out of control. Its gone  we have now presided over the largest increase in the size of government since the Great Society. We Republicans came to power to change government, and government changed us. And the  the worst symptom on this disease is what my friend, Tom Coburn, calls earmarking as a gateway drug, because its a gateway. Its a gateway to out-of-control spending and corruption. And we have former members of Congress now residing in federal prison because of the evils of this earmarking and pork-barrel spending. You know, we spent $3 million to study the DNA of bears in Montana. I dont know if that was a criminal issue or a paternal issue, but the fact is that it was $3 million of our taxpayers money. And it has got to be brought under control. As president of the United States, I want to assure you, Ive got a pen. This ones kind of old. Ive got a pen, and Im going to veto every single spending bill that comes across my desk. I will make them famous. You will know their names. Now, Senator Obama, you wanted to know one of the differences. He has asked for $932 million of earmark pork-barrel spending, nearly a million dollars for every day that hes been in the United States Senate. I suggest that people go up on the Web site of Citizens Against Government Waste, and theyll look at those projects. That kind of thing is not the way to rein in runaway spending in Washington, D.C. Thats one of the fundamental differences that Senator Obama and I have.",2008-09-26,Republican
Lehrer,"Senator Obama, two minutes.",2008-09-26,Moderator
Obama,"Well, Senator McCain is absolutely right that the earmarks process has been abused, which is why I suspended any requests for my home state, whether it was for senior centers or what have you, until we cleaned it up. And hes also right that oftentimes lobbyists and special interests are the ones that are introducing these kinds of requests, although that wasnt the case with me. But lets be clear: Earmarks account for $18 billion in last years budget. Senator McCain is proposing  and this is a fundamental difference between us  $300 billion in tax cuts to some of the wealthiest corporations and individuals in the country, $300 billion. Now, $18 billion is important; $300 billion is really important. And in his tax plan, you would have CEOs of Fortune 500 companies getting an average of $700,000 in reduced taxes, while leaving 100 million Americans out. So my attitude is, weve got to grow the economy from the bottom up. What Ive called for is a tax cut for 95 percent of working families, 95 percent. And that means that the ordinary American out there whos collecting a paycheck every day, theyve got a little extra money to be able to buy a computer for their kid, to fill up on this gas that is killing them. And over time, that, I think, is going to be a better recipe for economic growth than the  the policies of President Bush that John McCain wants to  wants to follow.",2008-09-26,Democrat
Lehrer,Senator McCain?,2008-09-26,Moderator
Mccain,"Well, again, I dont mean to go back and forth, but he",2008-09-26,Republican
Lehrer,"No, thats fine.",2008-09-26,Moderator
Mccain,"Senator Obama suspended those requests for pork-barrel projects after he was running for president of the United States. He didnt happen to see that light during the first three years as a member of the United States Senate, $932 million in requests. Maybe to Senator Obama its not a lot of money. But the point is that  you see, I hear this all the time. Its only $18 billion. Do you know that its tripled in the last five years? Do you know that its gone completely out of control to the point where it corrupts people? It corrupts people. Thats why we have, as I said, people under federal indictment and charges. Its a system thats got to be cleaned up. I have fought against it my career. I have fought against it. I was called the sheriff, by the  one of the senior members of the Appropriations Committee. I didnt win Miss Congeniality in the United States Senate. Now, Senator Obama didnt mention that, along with his tax cuts, he is also proposing some $800 billion in new spending on new programs. Now, thats a fundamental difference between myself and Senator Obama. I want to cut spending. I want to keep taxes low. The worst thing we could do in this economic climate is to raise peoples taxes.",2008-09-26,Republican
Obama,"I  I dont know where John is getting his figures. Lets just be clear. What I do is I close corporate loopholes, stop providing tax cuts to corporations that are shipping jobs overseas so that were giving tax breaks to companies that are investing here in the United States. I make sure that we have a health care system that allows for everyone to have basic coverage. I think those are pretty important priorities. And I pay for every dime of it. But lets go back to the original point. John, nobody is denying that $18 billion is important. And, absolutely, we need earmark reform. And when Im president, I will go line by line to make sure that we are not spending money unwisely. But the fact is that eliminating earmarks alone is not a recipe for how were going to get the middle class back on track.",2008-09-26,Democrat
Obama,"And when you look at your tax policies that are directed primarily at those who are doing well, and you are neglecting people who are really struggling right now, I think that is a continuation of the last eight years, and we cant afford another four.",2008-09-26,Democrat
Lehrer,"Respond directly to him about that, to Senator Obama about that, about the  hes made it twice now, about your tax  your policies about tax cuts.",2008-09-26,Moderator
Mccain,"Well  well, let me give you an example of what Senator Obama finds objectionable, the business tax. Right now, in the United States of America, business pays the second-highest business taxes in the world, 35 percent. Ireland pays 11 percent. Now, if youre a business person, and you can locate any place in the world, then, obviously, if you go to the country where its 11 percent tax versus 35 percent, youre going to be able to create jobs, increase your business, make more investment, et cetera. I want to cut that business tax. I want to cut it so that businesses will remain in  in the United States of America and create jobs. But, again, I want to return. Its a lot more than $18 billion in pork-barrel spending. I can tell you, its rife. Its throughout. The United States Senate will take up a continuing resolution tomorrow or the next day, sometime next week, with 2,000  2,000  look at them, my friends. Look at them. Youll be appalled. And Senator Obama is a recent convert, after requesting $932 million worth of pork-barrel spending projects. So the point is, I want people to have tax cuts. I want every family to have a $5,000 refundable tax credit so they can go out and purchase their own health care. I want to double the dividend from $3,500 to $7,000 for every dependent child in America. I know that the worst thing we could possibly do is to raise taxes on anybody, and a lot of people might be interested in Senator Obamas definition of rich.",2008-09-26,Republican
Lehrer,"Senator Obama, you have a question for Senator McCain on that?",2008-09-26,Moderator
Obama,"Well, let me just make a couple of points.",2008-09-26,Democrat
Lehrer,All right.,2008-09-26,Moderator
Obama,"My definition  heres what I can tell the American people: 95 percent of you will get a tax cut. And if you make less than $250,000, less than a quarter-million dollars a year, then you will not see one dimes worth of tax increase. Now, John mentioned the fact that business taxes on paper are high in this country, and hes absolutely right. Heres the problem: There are so many loopholes that have been written into the tax code, oftentimes with support of Senator McCain, that we actually see our businesses pay effectively one of the lowest tax rates in the world. And what that means, then, is that there are people out there who are working every day, who are not getting a tax cut, and you want to give them more. Its not like you want to close the loopholes. You just want to add an additional tax cut over the loopholes. And thats a problem. Just one last point I want to make, since Senator McCain talked about providing a $5,000 health credit. Now, what he doesnt tell you is that he intends to, for the first time in history, tax health benefits. So you may end up getting a $5,000 tax credit. Heres the only problem: Your employer now has to pay taxes on the health care that youre getting from your employer. And if you end up losing your health care from your employer, youve got to go out on the open market and try to buy it. It is not a good deal for the American people. But its an example of this notion that the market can always solve everything and that the less regulation we have, the better off were going to be.",2008-09-26,Democrat
Mccain,"Well, you know, let me just",2008-09-26,Republican
Lehrer,Weve got to go to another lead question.,2008-09-26,Moderator
Mccain,"I know we have to, but this is a classic example of walking the walk and talking the talk. We had an energy bill before the United States Senate. It was festooned with Christmas tree ornaments. It had all kinds of breaks for the oil companies, I mean, billions of dollars worth. I voted against it; Senator Obama voted for it.",2008-09-26,Republican
Obama,"John, you want to give oil companies another $4 billion.",2008-09-26,Democrat
Mccain,"Youve got to look at our record. Youve got to look at our records. Thats the important thing. Whos the person who has believed that the best thing for America is  is to have a tax system that is fundamentally fair? And Ive fought to simplify it, and I have proposals to simplify it. Lets give every American a choice: two tax brackets, generous dividends, and, two  and let Americans choose whether they want the  the existing tax code or they want a new tax code. And so, again, look at the record, particularly the energy bill. But, again, Senator Obama has shifted on a number of occasions. He has voted in the United States Senate to increase taxes on people who make as low as $42,000 a year.",2008-09-26,Republican
Obama,"Thats not true, John. Thats not true.",2008-09-26,Democrat
Mccain,"And thats just a fact. Again, you can look it up.",2008-09-26,Republican
Obama,"Look, its just not true. And if we want to talk about oil company profits, under your tax plan, John  this is undeniable  oil companies would get an additional $4 billion in tax breaks.",2008-09-26,Democrat
Mccain,"With all due respect, you already gave them to the oil companies.",2008-09-26,Republican
Obama,"No, but, John, the fact of the matter is, is that I was opposed to those tax breaks, tried to strip them out. Weve got an energy bill on the Senate floor right now that contains some good stuff, some stuff you want, including drilling off-shore, but youre opposed to it because it would strip away those tax breaks that have gone to oil companies.",2008-09-26,Democrat
Lehrer,"All right. All right, speaking of things that both of you want, another lead question, and it has to do with the rescue  the financial rescue thing that we started  started asking about.",2008-09-26,Moderator
Obama,"Well, there are a range of things that are probably going to have to be delayed. We dont yet know what our tax revenues are going to be. The economy is slowing down, so its hard to anticipate right now what the budget is going to look like next year. But theres no doubt that were not going to be able to do everything that I think needs to be done. There are some things that I think have to be done. We have to have energy independence, so Ive put forward a plan to make sure that, in 10 years time, we have freed ourselves from dependence on Middle Eastern oil by increasing production at home, but most importantly by starting to invest in alternative energy, solar, wind, biodiesel, making sure that were developing the fuel-efficient cars of the future right here in the United States, in Ohio and Michigan, instead of Japan and South Korea. We have to fix our health care system, which is putting an enormous burden on families. Just  a report just came out that the average deductible went up 30 percent on American families. They are getting crushed, and many of them are going bankrupt as a consequence of health care. Im meeting folks all over the country. We have to do that now, because it will actually make our businesses and our families better off. The third thing we have to do is weve got to make sure that were competing in education. Weve got to invest in science and technology. China had a space launch and a space walk. Weve got to make sure that our children are keeping pace in math and in science. And one of the things I think we have to do is make sure that college is affordable for every young person in America. And I also think that were going to have to rebuild our infrastructure, which is falling behind, our roads, our bridges, but also broadband lines that reach into rural communities. Also, making sure that we have a new electricity grid to get the alternative energy to population centers that are using them. So there are some  some things that weve got to do structurally to make sure that we can compete in this global economy. We cant shortchange those things. Weve got to eliminate programs that dont work, and weve got to make sure that the programs that we do have are more efficient and cost less.",2008-09-26,Democrat
Lehrer,"Are you  what priorities would you adjust, as president, Senator McCain, because of the  because of the financial bailout cost?",2008-09-26,Moderator
Mccain,"Look, we, no matter what, weve got to cut spending. We have  as I said, weve let government get completely out of control. Senator Obama has the most liberal voting record in the United States Senate. Its hard to reach across the aisle from that far to the left. The point  the point is  the point is, we need to examine every agency of government. First of all, by the way, Id eliminate ethanol subsidies. I oppose ethanol subsidies. I think that we have to return  particularly in defense spending, which is the largest part of our appropriations  we have to do away with cost-plus contracts. We now have defense systems that the costs are completely out of control. We tried to build a little ship called the Littoral Combat Ship that was supposed to cost $140 million, ended up costing $400 million, and we still havent done it. So we need to have fixed-cost contracts. We need very badly to understand that defense spending is very important and vital, particularly in the new challenges we face in the world, but we have to get a lot of the cost overruns under control. I know how to do that.",2008-09-26,Republican
Mccain,"I saved the taxpayers $6.8 billion by fighting a contract that was negotiated between Boeing and DOD that was completely wrong. And we fixed it and we killed it and the people ended up in federal prison so I know how to do this because Ive been involved these issues for many, many years.

Lehrer,Not willing to give that up?,2008-09-26,Moderator
Obama,"Not willing to give up the need to do it but there may be individual components that we cant do. But John is right we have to make cuts. We right now give $15 billion every year as subsidies to private insurers under the Medicare system. Doesnt work any better through the private insurers. They just skim off $15 billion. That was a give away and part of the reason is because lobbyists are able to shape how Medicare works. They did it on the Medicaid prescription drug bill and we have to change the culture. Tom  or John mentioned me being wildly liberal. Mostly thats just me opposing George Bushs wrong headed policies since Ive been in Congress but I think it is that it is also important to recognize I worked with Tom Coburn, the most conservative, one of the most conservative Republicans who John already mentioned to set up what we call a Google for government saying well list every dollar of federal spending to make sure that the taxpayer can take a look and see who, in fact, is promoting some of these spending projects that Johns been railing about.",2008-09-26,Democrat

I went to increase early childhood education and the notion that we should freeze that when there may be, for example, this Medicare subsidy, I think, doesnt make sense. Let me tell you another place to look for some savings. We are currently spending $10 billion a month in Iraq when they have a $79 billion surplus. It seems to me that if were going to be strong at home as well as strong abroad, that we have to look at bringing that war to a close.",2008-09-26,Democrat
Mccain,"Look, we are sending $700 billion a year overseas to countries that dont like us very much. Some of that money ends up in the hands of terrorist organizations. We have to have wind, tide, solar, natural gas, flex fuel cars and all that but we also have to have offshore drilling and we also have to have nuclear power. Senator Obama opposes both storing and reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel. You cant get there from here and the fact is that we can create 700,000 jobs by building constructing 45 new nuclear power plants by the year 2030. Nuclear power is not only important as far as eliminating our dependence on foreign oil but its also responsibility as far as climate change is concerned.

Are you  are you willing to acknowledge both of you that this financial crisis is going to affect the way you rule the country as president of the United States beyond the kinds of things that you have already  I mean, is it a major move? Is it going to have a major affect?",2008-09-26,Moderator
Obama,"Theres no doubt its gonna affect our budgets. There is no doubt about it. Not only  Even if we get all $700 billion back, lets assume the markets recover, were holding assets long enough that eventually taxpayers get it back and that happened during the Great Depression when Roosevelt purchased a whole bunch of homes, over time, home values went back up and in fact government made a profit. If were lucky and we do it right, that could potentially happen but in the short term theres an outlay and we may not see that money for a while. And because of the economys slowing down, I think we can also expect less tax revenue so theres no doubt that as president Im going to have to make some tough decision. The only point I want to make is this, that in order to make those tough decisions we have to know what our values are and who were fighting for and what our priorities are and if we are spending $300 billion on tax cuts for people who dont need them and werent even asking for them, and we are leaving out health care which is crushing on people all across the country, then I think we have made a bad decision and I want to make sure were not shortchanging our long term priorities.",2008-09-26,Democrat
Mccain,"Well, I want to make sure were not handing the health care system over to the federal government which is basically what would ultimately happen with Senator Obamas health care plan. I want the families to make decisions between themselves and their doctors. Not the federal government. Look. We have to obviously cut spending. I have fought to cut spending. Senator Obama has $800 billion in new spending programs. I would suggest he start by canceling some of those new spending program that he has. We cant I think adjust spending around to take care of the very much needed programs, including taking care of our veterans but I also want to say again a healthy economy with low taxes would not raising anyones taxes is probably the best recipe for eventually having our economy recover. And spending restraint has got to be a vital part of that. And the reason, one of the major reasons why were in the difficulties we are in today is because spending got out of control. We owe China $500 billion. And spending, I know, can be brought under control because I have fought against excessive spending my entire career. And I got plans to reduce and eliminate unnecessary and wasteful spending and if theres anybody here who thinks there arent agencies of government where spending can be cut and their budgets slashed they have not spent a lot of time in Washington.",2008-09-26,Republican

This orgy of spending and enormous deficits you voted for almost all of his budgets.

Mccain,"I think the lessons of Iraq are very clear that you cannot have a failed strategy that will then cause you to nearly lose a conflict. Our initial military success, we went in to Baghdad and everybody celebrated. And then the war was very badly mishandled. I went to Iraq in 2003 and came back and said, weve got to change this strategy. This strategy requires additional troops, it requires a fundamental change in strategy and I fought for it. And finally, we came up with a great general and a strategy that has succeeded. This strategy has succeeded. And we are winning in Iraq. And we will come home with victory and with honor. And that withdrawal is the result of every counterinsurgency that succeeds.",2008-09-26,Republican
Mccain,"And I want to tell you that now that we will succeed and our troops will come home, and not in defeat, that we will see a stable ally in the region and a fledgling democracy. The consequences of defeat would have been increased Iranian influence. It would have been increase in sectarian violence. It would have been a wider war, which the United States of America might have had to come back. So there was a lot at stake there. And thanks to this great general, David Petraeus, and the troops who serve under him, they have succeeded. And we are winning in Iraq, and we will come home. And we will come home as we have when we have won other wars and not in defeat.",2008-09-26,Republican
Lehrer,"Two minutes, how you see the lessons of Iraq, Senator Obama.",2008-09-26,Moderator
Obama,"Well, this is an area where Senator McCain and I have a fundamental difference because I think the first question is whether we should have gone into the war in the first place. Now six years ago, I stood up and opposed this war at a time when it was politically risky to do so because I said that not only did we not know how much it was going to cost, what our exit strategy might be, how it would affect our relationships around the world, and whether our intelligence was sound, but also because we hadnt finished the job in Afghanistan. We hadnt caught bin Laden. We hadnt put al Qaeda to rest, and as a consequence, I thought that it was going to be a distraction. Now Senator McCain and President Bush had a very different judgment. And I wish I had been wrong for the sake of the country and they had been right, but thats not the case. Weve spent over $600 billion so far, soon to be $1 trillion. We have lost over 4,000 lives. We have seen 30,000 wounded, and most importantly, from a strategic national security perspective, al Qaeda is resurgent, stronger now than at any time since 2001. We took our eye off the ball. And not to mention that we are still spending $10 billion a month, when they have a $79 billion surplus, at a time when we are in great distress here at home, and we just talked about the fact that our budget is way overstretched and we are borrowing money from overseas to try to finance just some of the basic functions of our government. So I think the lesson to be drawn is that we should never hesitate to use military force, and I will not, as president, in order to keep the American people safe. But we have to use our military wisely. And we did not use our military wisely in Iraq.",2008-09-26,Democrat

Senator Obama said the surge could not work, said it would increase sectarian violence, said it was doomed to failure. Recently on a television program, he said it exceed our wildest expectations. But yet, after conceding that, he still says that he would oppose the surge if he had to decide that again today.

But thats Senate inside baseball. But lets get back to the core issue here. Senator McCain is absolutely right that the violence has been reduced as a consequence of the extraordinary sacrifice of our troops and our military families. They have done a brilliant job, and General Petraeus has done a brilliant job. But understand, that was a tactic designed to contain the damage of the previous four years of mismanagement of this war. And so John likes  John, you like to pretend like the war started in 2007.

I was honored to be there. I was honored to speak to those troops. And you know, afterwards, we spent a lot of time with them. And you know what they said to us? They said, let us win.

And Senator Obama, who after promising not to vote to cut off funds for the troops, did the incredible thing of voting to cut off the funds for the troops in Iraq and Afghanistan.",2008-09-26,Republican
Obama,"Jim, there are a whole bunch of things we have got to answer. First of all, lets talk about this troop funding issue because John always brings this up. Senator McCain cut  Senator McCain opposed funding for troops in legislation that had a timetable, because he didnt believe in a timetable. I opposed funding a mission that had no timetable, and was open- ended, giving a blank check to George Bush. We had a difference on the timetable. We didnt have a difference on whether or not we were going to be funding troops. We had a legitimate difference, and I absolutely understand the difference between tactics and strategy. And the strategic question that the president has to ask is not whether or not we are employing a particular approach in the country once we have made the decision to be there. The question is, was this wise? We have seen Afghanistan worsen, deteriorate. We need more troops there. We need more resources there. Senator McCain, in the rush to go into Iraq, said, you know what? Weve been successful in Afghanistan. There is nobody who can pose a threat to us there. This is a time when bin Laden was still out, and now theyve reconstituted themselves. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates himself acknowledges the war on terrorism started in Afghanistan and it needs to end there. But we cant do it if we are not willing to give Iraq back its country. Now, what Ive said is we should end this war responsibly. We should do it in phases. But in 16 months we should be able to reduce our combat troops, put  provide some relief to military families and our troops and bolster our efforts in Afghanistan so that we can capture and kill bin Laden and crush al Qaeda. And right now, the commanders in Afghanistan, as well as Admiral Mullen, have acknowledged that we dont have enough troops to deal with Afghanistan because we still have more troops in Iraq than we did before the surge.",2008-09-26,Democrat

Now General Petraeus has praised the successes, but he said those successes are fragile and if we set a specific date for withdrawal  and by the way, Senator Obamas original plan, they would have been out last spring before the surge ever had a chance to succeed. And Im  Im  understand why Senator Obama was surprised and said that the surge succeeded beyond his wildest expectations.",2008-09-26,Republican
Mccain,"It didnt exceed beyond mine, because I know that thats a strategy that has worked and can succeed. But if we snatch defeat from the jaws of victory and adopt Senator Obamas plan, then we will have a wider war and it will make things more complicated throughout the region, including in Afghanistan.",2008-09-26,Republican
Lehrer,"Afghanistan, lead  a new  a new lead question. Now, having resolved Iraq, well move to Afghanistan.",2008-09-26,Moderator
Obama,"Yes, I think we need more troops. Ive been saying that for over a year now. And I think that we have to do it as quickly as possible, because its been acknowledged by the commanders on the ground the situation is getting worse, not better. We had the highest fatalities among U.S. troops this past year than at any time since 2002. And we are seeing a major offensive taking place  Al Qaida and Taliban crossing the border and attacking our troops in a brazen fashion. They are feeling emboldened. And we cannot separate Afghanistan from Iraq, because what our commanders have said is we dont have the troops right now to deal with Afghanistan. So I would send two to three additional brigades to Afghanistan. Now, keep in mind that we have four times the number of troops in Iraq, where nobody had anything to do with 9/11 before we went in, where, in fact, there was no Al Qaida before we went in, but we have four times more troops there than we do in Afghanistan. And that is a strategic mistake, because every intelligence agency will acknowledge that Al Qaida is the greatest threat against the United States and that Secretary of Defense Gates acknowledged the central front  that the place where we have to deal with these folks is going to be in Afghanistan and in Pakistan. So heres what we have to do comprehensively, though. Its not just more troops. We have to press the Afghan government to make certain that they are actually working for their people. And Ive said this to President Karzai. Number two, weve got to deal with a growing poppy trade that has exploded over the last several years. Number three, weve got to deal with Pakistan, because Al Qaida and the Taliban have safe havens in Pakistan, across the border in the northwest regions, and although, you know, under George Bush, with the support of Senator McCain, weve been giving them $10 billion over the last seven years, they have not done what needs to be done to get rid of those safe havens. And until we do, Americans here at home are not going to be safe.",2008-09-26,Democrat
Lehrer,"Afghanistan, Senator McCain?",2008-09-26,Moderator
Mccain,"First of all, I wont repeat the mistake that I regret enormously, and that is, after we were able to help the Afghan freedom fighters and drive the Russians out of Afghanistan, we basically washed our hands of the region. And the result over time was the Taliban, Al Qaida, and a lot of the difficulties we are facing today. So we cant ignore those lessons of history. Now, on this issue of aiding Pakistan, if youre going to aim a gun at somebody, George Shultz, our great secretary of state, told me once, youd better be prepared to pull the trigger. Im not prepared at this time to cut off aid to Pakistan. So Im not prepared to threaten it, as Senator Obama apparently wants to do, as he has said that he would announce military strikes into Pakistan. Weve got to get the support of the people of  of Pakistan. He said that he would launch military strikes into Pakistan. Now, you dont do that. You dont say that out loud. If you have to do things, you have to do things, and you work with the Pakistani government. Now, the new president of Pakistan, Kardari (sic), has got his hands full. And this area on the border has not been governed since the days of Alexander the Great. Ive been to Waziristan. I can see how tough that terrain is. Its ruled by a handful of tribes. And, yes, Senator Obama calls for more troops, but what he doesnt understand, its got to be a new strategy, the same strategy that he condemned in Iraq. Its going to have to be employed in Afghanistan. And were going to have to help the Pakistanis go into these areas and obtain the allegiance of the people. And its going to be tough. Theyve intermarried with Al Qaida and the Taliban. And its going to be tough. But we have to get the cooperation of the people in those areas. And the Pakistanis are going to have to understand that that bombing in the Marriott Hotel in Islamabad was a signal from the terrorists that they dont want that government to cooperate with us in combating the Taliban and jihadist elements. So weve got a lot of work to do in Afghanistan. But Im confident, now that General Petraeus is in the new position of command, that we will employ a strategy which not only means additional troops  and, by the way, there have been 20,000 additional troops, from 32,000 to 53,000, and there needs to be more. So its not just the addition of troops that matters. Its a strategy that will succeed. And Pakistan is a very important element in this. And I know how to work with them. And I guarantee you I would not publicly state that Im going to attack them.",2008-09-26,Republican
Obama,"Nobody talked about attacking Pakistan. Heres what I said. And if John wants to disagree with this, he can let me know, that, if the United States has Al Qaida, bin Laden, top-level lieutenants in our sights, and Pakistan is unable or unwilling to act, then we should take them out. Now, I think thats the right strategy; I think thats the right policy. And, John, I  youre absolutely right that presidents have to be prudent in what they say. But, you know, coming from you, who, you know, in the past has threatened extinction for North Korea and, you know, sung songs about bombing Iran, I dont know, you know, how credible that is. I think this is the right strategy. Now, Senator McCain is also right that its difficult. This is not an easy situation. Youve got cross-border attacks against U.S. troops. And weve got a choice. We could allow our troops to just be on the defensive and absorb those blows again and again and again, if Pakistan is unwilling to cooperate, or we have to start making some decisions. And the problem, John, with the strategy thats been pursued was that, for 10 years, we coddled Musharraf, we alienated the Pakistani population, because we were anti-democratic. We had a 20th-century mindset that basically said, Well, you know, he may be a dictator, but hes our dictator. And as a consequence, we lost legitimacy in Pakistan. We spent $10 billion. And in the meantime, they werent going after Al Qaida, and they are more powerful now than at any time since we began the war in Afghanistan. Thats going to change when Im president of the United States.",2008-09-26,Democrat
Mccain,"I  I dont think that Senator Obama understands that there was a failed state in Pakistan when Musharraf came to power. Everybody who was around then, and had been there, and knew about it knew that it was a failed state. But let me tell you, you know, this business about bombing Iran and all that, let me tell you my record. Back in 1983, when I was a brand-new United States congressman, the one  the person I admired the most and still admire the most, Ronald Reagan, wanted to send Marines into Lebanon. And I saw that, and I saw the situation, and I stood up, and I voted against that, because I was afraid that they couldnt make peace in a place where 300 or 400 or several hundred Marines would make a difference. Tragically, I was right: Nearly 300 Marines lost their lives in the bombing of the barracks. And then we had Somalia  then we had the first Gulf War. I supported  I supported that. I supported us going into Bosnia, when a number of my own party and colleagues was against that operation in Bosnia. That was the right thing to do, to stop genocide and to preserve what was necessary inside of Europe. I supported what we did in Kosovo. I supported it because ethnic cleansing and genocide was taking place there. And I have a record  and Somalia, I opposed that we should turn  turn the force in Somalia from a peacekeeping force into a peacemaking force, which they were not capable of. So I have a record. I have a record of being involved in these national security issues, which involve the highest responsibility and the toughest decisions that any president can make, and that is to send our young men and women into harms way. And Ill tell you, I had a town hall meeting in Wolfeboro, New Hampshire, and a woman stood up and she said, Senator McCain, I want you to do me the honor of wearing a bracelet with my sons name on it. He was 22 years old and he was killed in combat outside of Baghdad, Matthew Stanley, before Christmas last year. This was last August, a year ago. And I said, I will  I will wear his bracelet with honor. And this was August, a year ago. And then she said, But, Senator McCain, I want you to do everything  promise me one thing, that youll do everything in your power to make sure that my sons death was not in vain. That means that that mission succeeds, just like those young people who re-enlisted in Baghdad, just like the mother I met at the airport the other day whose son was killed.

She asked me, can you please make sure another mother is not going through what Im going through. No U.S. soldier ever dies in vain because theyre carrying out the missions of their commander in chief. And we honor all the service that theyve provided. Our troops have performed brilliantly. The question is for the next president, are we making good judgments about how to keep America safe precisely because sending our military into battle is such an enormous step. And the point that I originally made is that we took our eye off Afghanistan, we took our eye off the folks who perpetrated 9/11, they are still sending out videotapes and Senator McCain, nobody is talking about defeat in Iraq, but I have to say we are having enormous problems in Afghanistan because of that decision. And it is not true you have consistently been concerned about what happened in Afghanistan. At one point, while you were focused on Iraq, you said well, we can muddle through Afghanistan. You dont muddle through the central front on terror and you dont muddle through going after bin Laden. You dont muddle through stamping out the Taliban.

But the important thing is, if we suffer defeat in Iraq, which General Petraeus predicts we will, if we adopted Senator Obamas set date for withdrawal, then that will have a calamitous effect in Afghanistan and American national security interests in the region.

Mccain,"My reading of the threat from Iran is that if Iran acquires nuclear weapons, it is an existential threat to the State of Israel and it is a threat to other countries in the region because the other countries in the region will feel compelling requirement to acquire nuclear weapons as well. Now we cannot allow a second Holocaust. Lets just make that very clear. What I have proposed for a long time, and Ive had conversation with foreign leaders about forming a league of democracies, lets be clear and lets have some straight talk. The Russians are preventing significant action in the United Nations Security Council. I have proposed a league of democracies, a group of people  a group of countries that share common interests, common values, common ideals, they also control a lot of the worlds economic power. We could impose significant meaningful, painful sanctions on the Iranians that I think could have a beneficial effect. The Iranians have a lousy government, so therefore their economy is lousy, even though they have significant oil revenues. So I am convinced that together, we can, with the French, with the British, with the Germans and other countries, democracies around the world, we can affect Iranian behavior. But have no doubt, but have no doubt that the Iranians continue on the path to the acquisition of a nuclear weapon as we speak tonight. And it is a threat not only in this region but around the world. What Id also like to point out the Iranians are putting the most lethal IEDs into Iraq which are killing young Americans, there are special groups in Iran coming into Iraq and are being trained in Iran. There is the Republican Guard in Iran, which Senator Kyl had an amendment in order to declare them a sponsor of terror. Senator Obama said that would be provocative. So this is a serious threat. This is a serious threat to security in the world, and I believe we can act and we can act with our friends and allies and reduce that threat as quickly as possible, but have no doubt about the ultimate result of them acquiring nuclear weapons.",2008-09-26,Republican
Lehrer,"Two minutes on Iran, Senator Obama.",2008-09-26,Moderator
Obama,"Well, let me just correct something very quickly. I believe the Republican Guard of Iran is a terrorist organization. Ive consistently said so. What Senator McCain refers to is a measure in the Senate that would try to broaden the mandate inside of Iraq. To deal with Iran. And ironically, the single thing that has strengthened Iran over the last several years has been the war in Iraq. Iraq was Irans mortal enemy. That was cleared away. And what weve seen over the last several years is Irans influence grow. They have funded Hezbollah, they have funded Hamas, they have gone from zero centrifuges to 4,000 centrifuges to develop a nuclear weapon. So obviously, our policy over the last eight years has not worked. Senator McCain is absolutely right, we cannot tolerate a nuclear Iran. It would be a game changer. Not only would it threaten Israel, a country that is our stalwart ally, but it would also create an environment in which you could set off an arms race in this Middle East. Now heres what we need to do. We do need tougher sanctions. I do not agree with Senator McCain that were going to be able to execute the kind of sanctions we need without some cooperation with countries like Russia and China that are, I think Senator McCain would agree, not democracies, but have extensive trade with Iran but potentially have an interest in making sure Iran doesnt have a nuclear weapon. But we are also going to have to, I believe, engage in tough direct diplomacy with Iran and this is a major difference I have with Senator McCain, this notion that by not talking to people we are punishing them has not worked. It has not worked in Iran, it has not worked in North Korea. In each instance, our efforts at isolation have actually accelerated their efforts to get nuclear weapons.

Here is Ahmadinenene (ph), Ahmadinejad, who is, Ahmadinejad, who is now in New York, talking about the extermination of the State of Israel, of wiping Israel off the map, and were going to sit down, without precondition, across the table, to legitimize and give a propaganda platform to a person that is espousing the extermination of the state of Israel, and therefore then giving them more credence in the world arena and therefore saying, theyve probably been doing the right thing, because you will sit down across the table from them and that will legitimize their illegal behavior. The point is that throughout history, whether it be Ronald Reagan, who wouldnt sit down with Brezhnev, Andropov or Chernenko until Gorbachev was ready with glasnost and perestroika. Or whether it be Nixons trip to China, which was preceded by Henry Kissinger, many times before he went. Look, Ill sit down with anybody, but theres got to be pre-conditions. Those pre-conditions would apply that we wouldnt legitimize with a face to face meeting, a person like Ahmadinejad. Now, Senator Obama said, without preconditions.",2008-09-26,Republican
Obama,"So lets talk about this. First of all, Ahmadinejad is not the most powerful person in Iran. So he may not be the right person to talk to. But I reserve the right, as president of the United States to meet with anybody at a time and place of my choosing if I think its going to keep America safe. And Im glad that Senator McCain brought up the history, the bipartisan history of us engaging in direct diplomacy.",2008-09-26,Democrat
Obama,"Senator McCain mentioned Henry Kissinger, whos one of his advisers, who, along with five recent secretaries of state, just said that we should meet with Iran  guess what  without precondition. This is one of your own advisers. Now, understand what this means without preconditions. It doesnt mean that you invite them over for tea one day. What it means is that we dont do what weve been doing, which is to say, Until you agree to do exactly what we say, we wont have direct contacts with you. Theres a difference between preconditions and preparation. Of course weve got to do preparations, starting with low-level diplomatic talks, and it may not work, because Iran is a rogue regime. But I will point out that I was called naive when I suggested that we need to look at exploring contacts with Iran. And you know what? President Bush recently sent a senior ambassador, Bill Burns, to participate in talks with the Europeans around the issue of nuclear weapons. Again, it may not work, but if it doesnt work, then we have strengthened our ability to form alliances to impose the tough sanctions that Senator McCain just mentioned. And when we havent done it, as in North Korea  let me just take one more example  in North Korea, we cut off talks. Theyre a member of the axis of evil. We cant deal with them. And you know what happened? They went  they quadrupled their nuclear capacity. They tested a nuke. They tested missiles. They pulled out of the nonproliferation agreement. And they sent nuclear secrets, potentially, to countries like Syria. When we re-engaged  because, again, the Bush administration reversed course on this  then we have at least made some progress, although right now, because of the problems in North Korea, we are seeing it on shaky ground. And  and I just  so I just have to make this general point that the Bush administration, some of Senator McCains own advisers all think this is important, and Senator McCain appears resistant. He even said the other day that he would not meet potentially with the prime minister of Spain, because he  you know, he wasnt sure whether they were aligned with us. I mean, Spain? Spain is a NATO ally.",2008-09-26,Democrat
Mccain,Of course.,2008-09-26,Republican
Obama,"If we cant meet with our friends, I dont know how were going to lead the world in terms of dealing with critical issues like terrorism.",2008-09-26,Democrat
Mccain,"Im not going to set the White House visitors schedule before Im president of the United States. I dont even have a seal yet. Look, Dr. Kissinger did not say that he would approve of face-to- face meetings between the president of the United States and the president  and Ahmadinejad. He did not say that.",2008-09-26,Republican
Obama,Of course not.,2008-09-26,Democrat
Mccain,"He said that there could be secretary-level and lower level meetings. Ive always encouraged them. The Iranians have met with Ambassador Crocker in Baghdad. What Senator Obama doesnt seem to understand that if without precondition you sit down across the table from someone who has called Israel a stinking corpse, and wants to destroy that country and wipe it off the map, you legitimize those comments. This is dangerous. It isnt just naive; its dangerous. And so we just have a fundamental difference of opinion. As far as North Korea is concerned, our secretary of state, Madeleine Albright, went to North Korea. By the way, North Korea, most repressive and brutal regime probably on Earth. The average South Korean is three inches taller than the average North Korean, a huge gulag. We dont know what the status of the dear leaders health is today, but we know this, that the North Koreans have broken every agreement that theyve entered into. And we ought to go back to a little bit of Ronald Reagans trust, but verify, and certainly not sit down across the table from  without precondition, as Senator Obama said he did twice, I mean, its just dangerous.",2008-09-26,Republican
Obama,"Look, I mean, Senator McCain keeps on using this example that suddenly the president would just meet with somebody without doing any preparation, without having low-level talks. Nobodys been talking about that, and Senator McCain knows it. This is a mischaracterization of my position. When we talk about preconditions  and Henry Kissinger did say we should have contacts without preconditions  the idea is that we do not expect to solve every problem before we initiate talks. And, you know, the Bush administration has come to recognize that it hasnt worked, this notion that we are simply silent when it comes to our enemies. And the notion that we would sit with Ahmadinejad and not say anything while hes spewing his nonsense and his vile comments is ridiculous. Nobody is even talking about that.",2008-09-26,Democrat
Mccain,"So let me get this right. We sit down with Ahmadinejad, and he says, Were going to wipe Israel off the face of the Earth, and we say, No, youre not? Oh, please.",2008-09-26,Republican
Obama,"No, let me tell",2008-09-26,Democrat
Mccain,"By the way, my friend, Dr. Kissinger, whos been my friend for 35 years, would be interested to hear this conversation and Senator Obamas depiction of his  of his positions on the issue. Ive known him for 35 years.",2008-09-26,Republican

Lehrer,New lead question.,2008-09-26,Moderator
Obama,"Well, I think that, given whats happened over the last several weeks and months, our entire Russian approach has to be evaluated, because a resurgent and very aggressive Russia is a threat to the peace and stability of the region. Their actions in Georgia were unacceptable. They were unwarranted. And at this point, it is absolutely critical for the next president to make clear that we have to follow through on our six-party  or the six-point cease-fire. They have to remove themselves from South Ossetia and Abkhazia. It is absolutely important that we have a unified alliance and that we explain to the Russians that you cannot be a 21st-century superpower, or power, and act like a 20th-century dictatorship. And we also have to affirm all the fledgling democracies in that region, you know, the Estonians, the Lithuanians, the Latvians, the Poles, the Czechs, that we are, in fact, going to be supportive and in solidarity with them in their efforts. They are members of NATO. And to countries like Georgia and the Ukraine, I think we have to insist that they are free to join NATO if they meet the requirements, and they should have a membership action plan immediately to start bringing them in. Now, we also cant return to a Cold War posture with respect to Russia. Its important that we recognize there are going to be some areas of common interest. One is nuclear proliferation. They have not only 15,000 nuclear warheads, but theyve got enough to make another 40,000, and some of those loose nukes could fall into the hands of Al Qaida. This is an area where Ive led on in the Senate, working with a Republican ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Dick Lugar, to deal with the proliferation of loose nuclear weapons. Thats an area where were going to have to work with Russia. And we have to recognize that the way theyve been behaving lately demands a sharp response from the international community and our allies.",2008-09-26,Democrat
Lehrer,"Two minutes on Russia, Senator McCain.",2008-09-26,Moderator
Mccain,"Well, I was interested in Senator Obamas reaction to the Russian aggression against Georgia. His first statement was, Both sides ought to show restraint. Again, a little bit of naivete there. He doesnt understand that Russia committed serious aggression against Georgia. And Russia has now become a nation fueled by petro-dollars that is basically a KGB apparatchik-run government. I looked into Mr. Putins eyes, and I saw three letters, a K, a G, and a B. And their aggression in Georgia is not acceptable behavior. I dont believe were going to go back to the Cold War. I am sure that that will not happen. But I do believe that we need to bolster our friends and allies. And that wasnt just about a problem between Georgia and Russia. It had everything to do with energy. Theres a pipeline that runs from the Caspian through Georgia through Turkey. And, of course, we know that the Russians control other sources of energy into Europe, which they have used from time to time. Its not accidental that the presidents of Latvia, Estonia, Lithuania, Poland, and Ukraine flew to Georgia, flew to Tbilisi, where I have spent significant amount of time with a great young president, Misha Saakashvili.",2008-09-26,Republican
Mccain,"And they showed solidarity with them, but, also, they are very concerned about the Russian threats to regain their status of the old Russian to regain their status of the old Russian empire. Now, I think the Russians ought to understand that we will support  we, the United States  will support the inclusion of Georgia and Ukraine in the natural process, inclusion into NATO. We also ought to make it very clear that the Russians are in violation of their cease-fire agreement. They have stationed additional troops in Abkhazia and South Ossetia. By the way, I went there once, and we went inside and drove in, and there was a huge poster. And this is  this is Georgian territory. And there was a huge poster of Vladimir Putin, and it said, Vladimir Putin, our president. It was very clear, the Russian intentions towards Georgia. They were just waiting to seize the opportunity. So, this is a very difficult situation. We want to work with the Russians. But we also have every right to expect the Russians to behave in a fashion and keeping with a  with a  with a country who respects international boundaries and the norms of international behavior. And watch Ukraine. This whole thing has got a lot to do with Ukraine, Crimea, the base of the Russian fleet in Sevastopol. And the breakdown of the political process in Ukraine between Tymoshenko and Yushchenko is a very serious problem. So watch Ukraine, and lets make sure that we  that the Ukrainians understand that we are their friend and ally.",2008-09-26,Republican
Lehrer,You see any  do you have a major difference with what he just said?,2008-09-26,Moderator
Obama,"No, actually, I think Senator McCain and I agree for the most part on these issues. Obviously, I disagree with this notion that somehow we did not forcefully object to Russians going into Georgia. I immediately said that this was illegal and objectionable. And, absolutely, I wanted a cessation of the violence, because it put an enormous strain on Georgia, and thats why I was the first to say that we have to rebuild the Georgian economy and called for a billion dollars that has now gone in to help them rebuild. Because part of Russias intentions here was to weaken the economy to the point where President Saakashvili was so weakened that he might be replaced by somebody that Putin favored more. Two points I think are important to think about when it comes to Russia. Number one is we have to have foresight and anticipate some of these problems. So back in April, I warned the administration that you had Russian peacekeepers in Georgian territory. That made no sense whatsoever. And what we needed to do was replace them with international peacekeepers and a special envoy to resolve the crisis before it boiled over. That wasnt done. But had it been done, its possible we could have avoided the issue. The second point I want to make is  is the issue of energy. Russia is in part resurgent and Putin is feeling powerful because of petro-dollars, as Senator McCain mentioned. That means that we, as one of the biggest consumers of oil  25 percent of the worlds oil  have to have an energy strategy not just to deal with Russia, but to deal with many of the rogue states weve talked about, Iran, Venezuela. And that means, yes, increasing domestic production and off-shore drilling, but we only have 3 percent of the worlds oil supplies and we use 25 percent of the worlds oil. So we cant simply drill our way out of the problem. What were going to have to do is to approach it through alternative energy, like solar, and wind, and biodiesel, and, yes, nuclear energy, clean-coal technology. And, you know, Ive got a plan for us to make a significant investment over the next 10 years to do that. And I have to say, Senator McCain and I, I think agree on the importance of energy, but Senator McCain mentioned earlier the importance of looking at a record. Over 26 years, Senator McCain voted 23 times against alternative energy, like solar, and wind, and biodiesel. And so we  we  weve got to walk the walk and not just talk the talk when it comes to energy independence, because this is probably going to be just as vital for our economy and the pain that people are feeling at the pump  and, you know, winters coming and home heating oil  as it is our national security and the issue of climate change thats so important.",2008-09-26,Democrat

Mccain," its hard to get there from here. And off-shore drilling is also something that is very important and it is a bridge. And we know that, if we drill off-shore and exploit a lot of these reserves, it will help, at temporarily, relieve our energy requirements. And it will have, I think, an important effect on the price of a barrel of oil.",2008-09-26,Republican

Lehrer,"This is the last  last lead question. You have two minutes each. And the question is this, beginning with you, Senator McCain.",2008-09-26,Moderator
Mccain,"I think its much less than it was the day after 9/11. I think it  that we have a safer nation, but we are a long way from safe. And I want to tell you that one of the things Im most proud of, among others, because I have worked across the aisle. I have a long record on that, on a long series of reforms. But after 9/11, Senator Joe Lieberman and I decided that we needed a commission, and that was a commission to investigate 9/11, and find out what happened, and fix it. And we were  we were opposed by the administration, another area where I differed with this administration. And we were stymied until the families of 9/11 came, and they descended on Washington, and we got that legislation passed. And there were a series of recommendations, as I recall, more than 40. And Im happy to say that weve gotten written into law most of those reforms recommended by that commission. Im proud of that work, again, bipartisan, reaching across the aisle, working together, Democrat and Republican alike. So we have a long way to go in our intelligence services. We have to do a better job in human intelligence. And weve got to  to make sure that we have people who are trained interrogators so that we dont ever torture a prisoner ever again. We have to make sure that our technological and intelligence capabilities are better. We have to work more closely with our allies. I know our allies, and I can work much more closely with them. But I can tell you that I think America is safer today than it was on 9/11. But that doesnt mean that we dont have a long way to go. And Id like to remind you, also, as a result of those recommendations, weve probably had the largest reorganization of government since we established the Defense Department. And I think that those men and women in those agencies are doing a great job. But we still have a long way to go before we can declare America safe, and that means doing a better job along our borders, as well.",2008-09-26,Republican
Lehrer,"Two minutes, Senator Obama.",2008-09-26,Moderator
Obama,"Well, first of all, I think that we are safer in some ways. Obviously, weve poured billions of dollars into airport security. We have done some work in terms of securing potential targets, but we still have a long way to go. Weve got to make sure that were hardening our chemical sites. We havent done enough in terms of transit; we havent done enough in terms of ports. And the biggest threat that we face right now is not a nuclear missile coming over the skies. Its in a suitcase. This is why the issue of nuclear proliferation is so important. It is the  the biggest threat to the United States is a terrorist getting their hands on nuclear weapons. And we  we are spending billions of dollars on missile defense. And I actually believe that we need missile defense, because of Iran and North Korea and the potential for them to obtain or to launch nuclear weapons, but I also believe that, when we are only spending a few hundred million dollars on nuclear proliferation, then were making a mistake. The other thing that we have to focus on, though, is Al Qaida. They are now operating in 60 countries. We cant simply be focused on Iraq. We have to go to the root cause, and that is in Afghanistan and Pakistan. Thats going to be critical. We are going to need more cooperation with our allies. And one last point I want to make. It is important for us to understand that the way we are perceived in the world is going to make a difference, in terms of our capacity to get cooperation and root out terrorism. And one of the things that I intend to do as president is to restore Americas standing in the world. We are less respected now than we were eight years ago or even four years ago.",2008-09-26,Democrat
Obama,"And this is the greatest country on Earth. But because of some of the mistakes that have been made  and I give Senator McCain great credit on the torture issue, for having identified that as something that undermines our long-term security  because of those things, we, I think, are going to have a lot of work to do in the next administration to restore that sense that America is that shining beacon on a hill.",2008-09-26,Democrat
Lehrer,Do you agree theres much to be done in a new administration to restore,2008-09-26,Moderator
Mccain,"But in the case of missile defense, Senator Obama said it had to be, quote, proven. That wasnt proven when Ronald Reagan said we would do SDI, which is missile defense. And it was major  a major factor in bringing about the end of the Cold War. We seem to come full circle again. Senator Obama still doesnt quite understand  or doesnt get it  that if we fail in Iraq, it encourages Al Qaida. They would establish a base in Iraq. The consequences of defeat, which would result from his plan of withdrawal and according to date certain, regardless of conditions, according to our military leaders, according to every expert, would lead to defeat  possible defeat, loss of all the fragile sacrifice that weve made of American blood and treasure, which grieves us all. All of that would be lost if we followed Senator Obamas plan to have specific dates with withdrawal, regardless of conditions on the ground. And General Petraeus says we have had great success, but its very fragile. And we cant do what Senator Obama wants to do. That is the central issue of our time. And I think Americans will judge very seriously as to whether thats the right path or the wrong path and who should be the next president of the United States.",2008-09-26,Republican
Lehrer,You see the same connections that Senator McCain does?,2008-09-26,Moderator
Obama,"Oh, theres no doubt. Look, over the last eight years, this administration, along with Senator McCain, have been solely focused on Iraq. That has been their priority. That has been where all our resources have gone. In the meantime, bin Laden is still out there. He is not captured. He is not killed. Al Qaida is resurgent. In the meantime, weve got challenges, for example, with China, where we are borrowing billions of dollars. They now hold a trillion dollars worth of our debt. And they are active in countries like  in regions like Latin America, and Asia, and Africa. They are  the conspicuousness of their presence is only matched by our absence, because weve been focused on Iraq. We have weakened our capacity to project power around the world because we have viewed everything through this single lens, not to mention, look at our economy. We are now spending $10 billion or more every month. And that means we cant provide health care to people who need it. We cant invest in science and technology, which will determine whether or not we are going to be competitive in the long term. There has never been a country on Earth that saw its economy decline and yet maintained its military superiority. So this is a national security issue. We havent adequately funded veterans care. I sit on the Veterans Affairs Committee, and weve got  I meet veterans all across the country who are trying to figure out, How can I get disability payments? Ive got post-traumatic stress disorder, and yet I cant get treatment. So we have put all chips in, right there, and nobody is talking about losing this war. What we are talking about is recognizing that the next president has to have a broader strategic vision about all the challenges that we face. Thats been missing over the last eight years. That sense is something that I want to restore.",2008-09-26,Democrat
Mccain,"Ive been involved, as I mentioned to you before, in virtually every major national security challenge weve faced in the last 20-some years. There are some advantages to experience, and knowledge, and judgment. And I  and I honestly dont believe that Senator Obama has the knowledge or experience and has made the wrong judgments in a number of areas, including his initial reaction to Russian invasion  aggression in Georgia, to his  you know, weve seen this stubbornness before in this administration to cling to a belief that somehow the surge has not succeeded and failing to acknowledge that he was wrong about the surge is  shows to me that we  that  that we need more flexibility in a president of the United States than that. As far as our other issues that he brought up are concerned, I know the veterans. I know them well. And I know that they know that Ill take care of them. And Ive been proud of their support and their recognition of my service to the veterans. And I love them. And Ill take care of them. And they know that Ill take care of them. And thats going to be my job. But, also, I have the ability, and the knowledge, and the background to make the right judgments, to keep this country safe and secure. Reform, prosperity, and peace, these are major challenges to the United States of America. I dont think I need any on-the-job training. Im ready to go at it right now.",2008-09-26,Republican
Obama,"Well, let me just make a closing point. You know, my father came from Kenya. Thats where I get my name. And in the 60s, he wrote letter after letter to come to college here in the United States because the notion was that there was no other country on Earth where you could make it if you tried. The ideals and the values of the United States inspired the entire world. I dont think any of us can say that our standing in the world now, the way children around the world look at the United States, is the same. And part of what we need to do, what the next president has to do  and this is part of our judgment, this is part of how were going to keep America safe  is to  to send a message to the world that we are going to invest in issues like education, we are going to invest in issues that  that relate to how ordinary people are able to live out their dreams.

Lehrer,"Good evening from the Ford Center for the Performing Arts at the University of Mississippi in Oxford. Im Jim Lehrer of the NewsHour on PBS, and I welcome you to the first of the 2008 presidential debates between the Republican nominee, Senator John McCain of Arizona, and the Democratic nominee, Senator Barack Obama of Illinois. The Commission on Presidential Debates is the sponsor of this event and the three other presidential and vice presidential debates coming in October. Tonights will primarily be about foreign policy and national security, which, by definition, includes the global financial crisis. It will be divided roughly into nine-minute segments. Direct exchanges between the candidates and moderator follow-ups are permitted after each candidate has two minutes to answer the lead question in an order determined by a coin toss. The specific subjects and questions were chosen by me. They have not been shared or cleared with anyone. The audience here in the hall has promised to remain silent, no cheers, no applause, no noise of any kind, except right now, as we welcome Senators Obama and McCain. Let me begin with something General Eisenhower said in his 1952 presidential campaign. Quote, We must achieve both security and solvency. In fact, the foundation of military strength is economic strength, end quote. With that in mind, the first lead question. First response to you, Senator Obama. You have two minutes.",2008-09-26,Moderator
Obama,"Well, thank you very much, Jim, and thanks to the commission and the University of Mississippi, Ole Miss, for hosting us tonight. I cant think of a more important time for us to talk about the future of the country. You know, we are at a defining moment in our history. Our nation is involved in two wars, and we are going through the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. And although weve heard a lot about Wall Street, those of you on Main Street I think have been struggling for a while, and you recognize that this could have an impact on all sectors of the economy. So we have to move swiftly, and we have to move wisely. And Ive put forward a series of proposals that make sure that we protect taxpayers as we engage in this important rescue effort. Number one, weve got to make sure that weve got oversight over this whole process; $700 billion, potentially, is a lot of money. Number two, weve got to make sure that taxpayers, when they are putting their money at risk, have the possibility of getting that money back and gains, if the market  and when the market returns. Number three, weve got to make sure that none of that money is going to pad CEO bank accounts or to promote golden parachutes. And, number four, weve got to make sure that were helping homeowners, because the root problem here has to do with the foreclosures that are taking place all across the country. Now, we also have to recognize that this is a final verdict on eight years of failed economic policies promoted by George Bush, supported by Senator McCain, a theory that basically says that we can shred regulations and consumer protections and give more and more to the most, and somehow prosperity will trickle down. It hasnt worked. And I think that the fundamentals of the economy have to be measured by whether or not the middle class is getting a fair shake. Thats why Im running for president, and thats what I hope were going to be talking about tonight.",2008-09-26,Democrat
Lehrer,"Senator McCain, two minutes.",2008-09-26,Moderator
Mccain,"Well, thank you, Jim. And thanks to everybody. And I do have a sad note tonight. Senator Kennedy is in the hospital. Hes a dear and beloved friend to all of us. Our thoughts and prayers go out to the lion of the Senate. I also want to thank the University of Mississippi for hosting us tonight. And, Jim, I  Ive been not feeling too great about a lot of things lately. So have a lot of Americans who are facing challenges. But Im feeling a little better tonight, and Ill tell you why. Because as were here tonight in this debate, we are seeing, for the first time in a long time, Republicans and Democrats together, sitting down, trying to work out a solution to this fiscal crisis that were in. And have no doubt about the magnitude of this crisis. And were not talking about failure of institutions on Wall Street. Were talking about failures on Main Street, and people who will lose their jobs, and their credits, and their homes, if we dont fix the greatest fiscal crisis, probably in  certainly in our time, and Ive been around a little while. But the point is  the point is, we have finally seen Republicans and Democrats sitting down and negotiating together and coming up with a package. This package has transparency in it. It has to have accountability and oversight. It has to have options for loans to failing businesses, rather than the government taking over those loans. We have to  it has to have a package with a number of other essential elements to it. And, yes, I went back to Washington, and I met with my Republicans in the House of Representatives. And they werent part of the negotiations, and I understand that. And it was the House Republicans that decided that they would be part of the solution to this problem. But I want to emphasize one point to all Americans tonight. This isnt the beginning of the end of this crisis. This is the end of the beginning, if we come out with a package that will keep these institutions stable. And weve got a lot of work to do. And weve got to create jobs. And one of the areas, of course, is to eliminate our dependence on foreign oil.",2008-09-26,Republican
Lehrer,"All right, lets go back to my question. How do you all stand on the recovery plan? And talk to each other about it. Weve got five minutes. We can negotiate a deal right here.",2008-09-26,Moderator
Obama,"We havent seen the language yet. And I do think that theres constructive work being done out there. So, for the viewers who are watching, I am optimistic about the capacity of us to come together with a plan. Two years ago, I warned that, because of the subprime lending mess, because of the lax regulation, that we were potentially going to have a problem and tried to stop some of the abuses in mortgages that were taking place at the time. Last year, I wrote to the secretary of the Treasury to make sure that he understood the magnitude of this problem and to call on him to bring all the stakeholders together to try to deal with it. So  so the question, I think, that weve got to ask ourselves is, yes, weve got to solve this problem short term. And we are going to have to intervene; theres no doubt about that. But were also going to have to look at, how is it that we shredded so many regulations? We did not set up a 21st-century regulatory framework to deal with these problems. And that in part has to do with an economic philosophy that says that regulation is always bad.",2008-09-26,Democrat

Mccain,Sure.,2008-09-26,Republican
Lehrer, youre going to vote for the plan?,2008-09-26,Moderator
Mccain,"Sure. But  but let me  let me point out, I also warned about Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and warned about corporate greed and excess, and CEO pay, and all that. A lot of us saw this train wreck coming. But theres also the issue of responsibility. Youve mentioned President Dwight David Eisenhower. President Eisenhower, on the night before the Normandy invasion, went into his room, and he wrote out two letters. One of them was a letter congratulating the great members of the military and allies that had conducted and succeeded in the greatest invasion in history, still to this day, and forever. And he wrote out another letter, and that was a letter of resignation from the United States Army for the failure of the landings at Normandy. Somehow weve lost that accountability. Ive been heavily criticized because I called for the resignation of the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Weve got to start also holding people accountable, and weve got to reward people who succeed. But somehow in Washington today  and Im afraid on Wall Street  greed is rewarded, excess is rewarded, and corruption  or certainly failure to carry out our responsibility is rewarded. As president of the United States, people are going to be held accountable in my administration. And I promise you that that will happen.",2008-09-26,Republican
Lehrer,"Do you have something directly to say, Senator Obama, to Senator McCain about what he just said?",2008-09-26,Moderator
Obama,"Well, I think Senator McCains absolutely right that we need more responsibility, but we need it not just when theres a crisis. I mean, weve had years in which the reigning economic ideology has been whats good for Wall Street, but not whats good for Main Street. And there are folks out there whove been struggling before this crisis took place. And thats why its so important, as we solve this short-term problem, that we look at some of the underlying issues that have led to wages and incomes for ordinary Americans to go down, the  a health care system that is broken, energy policies that are not working, because, you know, 10 days ago, John said that the fundamentals of the economy are sound.",2008-09-26,Democrat

And unless we are holding ourselves accountable day in, day out, not just when theres a crisis for folks who have power and influence and can hire lobbyists, but for the nurse, the teacher, the police officer, who, frankly, at the end of each month, theyve got a little financial crisis going on. Theyre having to take out extra debt just to make their mortgage payments. We havent been paying attention to them. And if you look at our tax policies, its a classic example.",2008-09-26,Democrat
Lehrer,"So, Senator McCain, do you agree with what Senator Obama just said? And, if you dont, tell him what you disagree with.",2008-09-26,Moderator
Mccain,"No, I  look, weve got to fix the system. Weve got fundamental problems in the system. And Main Street is paying a penalty for the excesses and greed in Washington, D.C., and in the Wall Street. So theres no doubt that we have a long way to go. And, obviously, stricter interpretation and consolidation of the various regulatory agencies that werent doing their job, that has brought on this crisis. But I have a fundamental belief in the goodness and strength of the American worker. And the American worker is the most productive, the most innovative. America is still the greatest producer, exporter and importer. But weve got to get through these times, but I have a fundamental belief in the United States of America. And I still believe, under the right leadership, our best days are ahead of us.",2008-09-26,Republican
Lehrer,"All right, lets go to the next lead question, which is essentially following up on this same subject.",2008-09-26,Moderator
Mccain,"Well, the first thing we have to do is get spending under control in Washington. Its completely out of control. Its gone  we have now presided over the largest increase in the size of government since the Great Society. We Republicans came to power to change government, and government changed us. And the  the worst symptom on this disease is what my friend, Tom Coburn, calls earmarking as a gateway drug, because its a gateway. Its a gateway to out-of-control spending and corruption. And we have former members of Congress now residing in federal prison because of the evils of this earmarking and pork-barrel spending. You know, we spent $3 million to study the DNA of bears in Montana. I dont know if that was a criminal issue or a paternal issue, but the fact is that it was $3 million of our taxpayers money. And it has got to be brought under control. As president of the United States, I want to assure you, Ive got a pen. This ones kind of old. Ive got a pen, and Im going to veto every single spending bill that comes across my desk. I will make them famous. You will know their names. Now, Senator Obama, you wanted to know one of the differences. He has asked for $932 million of earmark pork-barrel spending, nearly a million dollars for every day that hes been in the United States Senate. I suggest that people go up on the Web site of Citizens Against Government Waste, and theyll look at those projects. That kind of thing is not the way to rein in runaway spending in Washington, D.C. Thats one of the fundamental differences that Senator Obama and I have.",2008-09-26,Republican
Lehrer,"Senator Obama, two minutes.",2008-09-26,Moderator
Obama,"Well, Senator McCain is absolutely right that the earmarks process has been abused, which is why I suspended any requests for my home state, whether it was for senior centers or what have you, until we cleaned it up. And hes also right that oftentimes lobbyists and special interests are the ones that are introducing these kinds of requests, although that wasnt the case with me. But lets be clear: Earmarks account for $18 billion in last years budget. Senator McCain is proposing  and this is a fundamental difference between us  $300 billion in tax cuts to some of the wealthiest corporations and individuals in the country, $300 billion. Now, $18 billion is important; $300 billion is really important. And in his tax plan, you would have CEOs of Fortune 500 companies getting an average of $700,000 in reduced taxes, while leaving 100 million Americans out. So my attitude is, weve got to grow the economy from the bottom up. What Ive called for is a tax cut for 95 percent of working families, 95 percent. And that means that the ordinary American out there whos collecting a paycheck every day, theyve got a little extra money to be able to buy a computer for their kid, to fill up on this gas that is killing them. And over time, that, I think, is going to be a better recipe for economic growth than the  the policies of President Bush that John McCain wants to  wants to follow.",2008-09-26,Democrat
Lehrer,Senator McCain?,2008-09-26,Moderator
Mccain,"Well, again, I dont mean to go back and forth, but he",2008-09-26,Republican
Lehrer,"No, thats fine.",2008-09-26,Moderator
Mccain,"Senator Obama suspended those requests for pork-barrel projects after he was running for president of the United States. He didnt happen to see that light during the first three years as a member of the United States Senate, $932 million in requests. Maybe to Senator Obama its not a lot of money. But the point is that  you see, I hear this all the time. Its only $18 billion. Do you know that its tripled in the last five years? Do you know that its gone completely out of control to the point where it corrupts people? It corrupts people. Thats why we have, as I said, people under federal indictment and charges. Its a system thats got to be cleaned up. I have fought against it my career. I have fought against it. I was called the sheriff, by the  one of the senior members of the Appropriations Committee. I didnt win Miss Congeniality in the United States Senate. Now, Senator Obama didnt mention that, along with his tax cuts, he is also proposing some $800 billion in new spending on new programs. Now, thats a fundamental difference between myself and Senator Obama. I want to cut spending. I want to keep taxes low. The worst thing we could do in this economic climate is to raise peoples taxes.",2008-09-26,Republican
Obama,"I  I dont know where John is getting his figures. Lets just be clear. What I do is I close corporate loopholes, stop providing tax cuts to corporations that are shipping jobs overseas so that were giving tax breaks to companies that are investing here in the United States. I make sure that we have a health care system that allows for everyone to have basic coverage. I think those are pretty important priorities. And I pay for every dime of it. But lets go back to the original point. John, nobody is denying that $18 billion is important. And, absolutely, we need earmark reform. And when Im president, I will go line by line to make sure that we are not spending money unwisely. But the fact is that eliminating earmarks alone is not a recipe for how were going to get the middle class back on track.",2008-09-26,Democrat
Obama,"And when you look at your tax policies that are directed primarily at those who are doing well, and you are neglecting people who are really struggling right now, I think that is a continuation of the last eight years, and we cant afford another four.",2008-09-26,Democrat
Lehrer,"Respond directly to him about that, to Senator Obama about that, about the  hes made it twice now, about your tax  your policies about tax cuts.",2008-09-26,Moderator
Mccain,"Well  well, let me give you an example of what Senator Obama finds objectionable, the business tax. Right now, in the United States of America, business pays the second-highest business taxes in the world, 35 percent. Ireland pays 11 percent. Now, if youre a business person, and you can locate any place in the world, then, obviously, if you go to the country where its 11 percent tax versus 35 percent, youre going to be able to create jobs, increase your business, make more investment, et cetera. I want to cut that business tax. I want to cut it so that businesses will remain in  in the United States of America and create jobs. But, again, I want to return. Its a lot more than $18 billion in pork-barrel spending. I can tell you, its rife. Its throughout. The United States Senate will take up a continuing resolution tomorrow or the next day, sometime next week, with 2,000  2,000  look at them, my friends. Look at them. Youll be appalled. And Senator Obama is a recent convert, after requesting $932 million worth of pork-barrel spending projects. So the point is, I want people to have tax cuts. I want every family to have a $5,000 refundable tax credit so they can go out and purchase their own health care. I want to double the dividend from $3,500 to $7,000 for every dependent child in America. I know that the worst thing we could possibly do is to raise taxes on anybody, and a lot of people might be interested in Senator Obamas definition of rich.",2008-09-26,Republican
Lehrer,"Senator Obama, you have a question for Senator McCain on that?",2008-09-26,Moderator
Obama,"Well, let me just make a couple of points.",2008-09-26,Democrat
Lehrer,All right.,2008-09-26,Moderator
Obama,"My definition  heres what I can tell the American people: 95 percent of you will get a tax cut. And if you make less than $250,000, less than a quarter-million dollars a year, then you will not see one dimes worth of tax increase. Now, John mentioned the fact that business taxes on paper are high in this country, and hes absolutely right. Heres the problem: There are so many loopholes that have been written into the tax code, oftentimes with support of Senator McCain, that we actually see our businesses pay effectively one of the lowest tax rates in the world. And what that means, then, is that there are people out there who are working every day, who are not getting a tax cut, and you want to give them more. Its not like you want to close the loopholes. You just want to add an additional tax cut over the loopholes. And thats a problem. Just one last point I want to make, since Senator McCain talked about providing a $5,000 health credit. Now, what he doesnt tell you is that he intends to, for the first time in history, tax health benefits. So you may end up getting a $5,000 tax credit. Heres the only problem: Your employer now has to pay taxes on the health care that youre getting from your employer. And if you end up losing your health care from your employer, youve got to go out on the open market and try to buy it. It is not a good deal for the American people. But its an example of this notion that the market can always solve everything and that the less regulation we have, the better off were going to be.",2008-09-26,Democrat

Lehrer,Weve got to go to another lead question.,2008-09-26,Moderator
Mccain,"I know we have to, but this is a classic example of walking the walk and talking the talk. We had an energy bill before the United States Senate. It was festooned with Christmas tree ornaments. It had all kinds of breaks for the oil companies, I mean, billions of dollars worth. I voted against it; Senator Obama voted for it.",2008-09-26,Republican
Obama,"John, you want to give oil companies another $4 billion.",2008-09-26,Democrat
Mccain,"Youve got to look at our record. Youve got to look at our records. Thats the important thing. Whos the person who has believed that the best thing for America is  is to have a tax system that is fundamentally fair? And Ive fought to simplify it, and I have proposals to simplify it. Lets give every American a choice: two tax brackets, generous dividends, and, two  and let Americans choose whether they want the  the existing tax code or they want a new tax code. And so, again, look at the record, particularly the energy bill. But, again, Senator Obama has shifted on a number of occasions. He has voted in the United States Senate to increase taxes on people who make as low as $42,000 a year.",2008-09-26,Republican
Obama,"Thats not true, John. Thats not true.",2008-09-26,Democrat
Mccain,"And thats just a fact. Again, you can look it up.",2008-09-26,Republican
Obama,"Look, its just not true. And if we want to talk about oil company profits, under your tax plan, John  this is undeniable  oil companies would get an additional $4 billion in tax breaks.",2008-09-26,Democrat
Mccain,"With all due respect, you already gave them to the oil companies.",2008-09-26,Republican
Obama,"No, but, John, the fact of the matter is, is that I was opposed to those tax breaks, tried to strip them out. Weve got an energy bill on the Senate floor right now that contains some good stuff, some stuff you want, including drilling off-shore, but youre opposed to it because it would strip away those tax breaks that have gone to oil companies.",2008-09-26,Democrat
Lehrer,"All right. All right, speaking of things that both of you want, another lead question, and it has to do with the rescue  the financial rescue thing that we started  started asking about.",2008-09-26,Moderator
Obama,"Well, there are a range of things that are probably going to have to be delayed. We dont yet know what our tax revenues are going to be. The economy is slowing down, so its hard to anticipate right now what the budget is going to look like next year. But theres no doubt that were not going to be able to do everything that I think needs to be done. There are some things that I think have to be done. We have to have energy independence, so Ive put forward a plan to make sure that, in 10 years time, we have freed ourselves from dependence on Middle Eastern oil by increasing production at home, but most importantly by starting to invest in alternative energy, solar, wind, biodiesel, making sure that were developing the fuel-efficient cars of the future right here in the United States, in Ohio and Michigan, instead of Japan and South Korea. We have to fix our health care system, which is putting an enormous burden on families. Just  a report just came out that the average deductible went up 30 percent on American families. They are getting crushed, and many of them are going bankrupt as a consequence of health care. Im meeting folks all over the country. We have to do that now, because it will actually make our businesses and our families better off. The third thing we have to do is weve got to make sure that were competing in education. Weve got to invest in science and technology. China had a space launch and a space walk. Weve got to make sure that our children are keeping pace in math and in science. And one of the things I think we have to do is make sure that college is affordable for every young person in America. And I also think that were going to have to rebuild our infrastructure, which is falling behind, our roads, our bridges, but also broadband lines that reach into rural communities. Also, making sure that we have a new electricity grid to get the alternative energy to population centers that are using them. So there are some  some things that weve got to do structurally to make sure that we can compete in this global economy. We cant shortchange those things. Weve got to eliminate programs that dont work, and weve got to make sure that the programs that we do have are more efficient and cost less.",2008-09-26,Democrat
Lehrer,"Are you  what priorities would you adjust, as president, Senator McCain, because of the  because of the financial bailout cost?",2008-09-26,Moderator
Mccain,"Look, we, no matter what, weve got to cut spending. We have  as I said, weve let government get completely out of control. Senator Obama has the most liberal voting record in the United States Senate. Its hard to reach across the aisle from that far to the left. The point  the point is  the point is, we need to examine every agency of government. First of all, by the way, Id eliminate ethanol subsidies. I oppose ethanol subsidies. I think that we have to return  particularly in defense spending, which is the largest part of our appropriations  we have to do away with cost-plus contracts. We now have defense systems that the costs are completely out of control. We tried to build a little ship called the Littoral Combat Ship that was supposed to cost $140 million, ended up costing $400 million, and we still havent done it. So we need to have fixed-cost contracts. We need very badly to understand that defense spending is very important and vital, particularly in the new challenges we face in the world, but we have to get a lot of the cost overruns under control. I know how to do that.",2008-09-26,Republican
Mccain,"I saved the taxpayers $6.8 billion by fighting a contract that was negotiated between Boeing and DOD that was completely wrong. And we fixed it and we killed it and the people ended up in federal prison so I know how to do this because Ive been involved these issues for many, many years.

Lehrer,Not willing to give that up?,2008-09-26,Moderator
Obama,"Not willing to give up the need to do it but there may be individual components that we cant do. But John is right we have to make cuts. We right now give $15 billion every year as subsidies to private insurers under the Medicare system. Doesnt work any better through the private insurers. They just skim off $15 billion. That was a give away and part of the reason is because lobbyists are able to shape how Medicare works. They did it on the Medicaid prescription drug bill and we have to change the culture. Tom  or John mentioned me being wildly liberal. Mostly thats just me opposing George Bushs wrong headed policies since Ive been in Congress but I think it is that it is also important to recognize I worked with Tom Coburn, the most conservative, one of the most conservative Republicans who John already mentioned to set up what we call a Google for government saying well list every dollar of federal spending to make sure that the taxpayer can take a look and see who, in fact, is promoting some of these spending projects that Johns been railing about.",2008-09-26,Democrat

Obama,"The problem with a spending freeze is youre using a hatchet where you need a scalpel. There are some programs that are very important that are under funded. I went to increase early childhood education and the notion that we should freeze that when there may be, for example, this Medicare subsidy, I think, doesnt make sense. Let me tell you another place to look for some savings. We are currently spending $10 billion a month in Iraq when they have a $79 billion surplus. It seems to me that if were going to be strong at home as well as strong abroad, that we have to look at bringing that war to a close.",2008-09-26,Democrat
Mccain,"Look, we are sending $700 billion a year overseas to countries that dont like us very much. Some of that money ends up in the hands of terrorist organizations. We have to have wind, tide, solar, natural gas, flex fuel cars and all that but we also have to have offshore drilling and we also have to have nuclear power. Senator Obama opposes both storing and reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel. You cant get there from here and the fact is that we can create 700,000 jobs by building constructing 45 new nuclear power plants by the year 2030. Nuclear power is not only important as far as eliminating our dependence on foreign oil but its also responsibility as far as climate change is concerned.

Are you  are you willing to acknowledge both of you that this financial crisis is going to affect the way you rule the country as president of the United States beyond the kinds of things that you have already  I mean, is it a major move? Is it going to have a major affect?",2008-09-26,Moderator
Obama,"Theres no doubt its gonna affect our budgets. There is no doubt about it. Not only  Even if we get all $700 billion back, lets assume the markets recover, were holding assets long enough that eventually taxpayers get it back and that happened during the Great Depression when Roosevelt purchased a whole bunch of homes, over time, home values went back up and in fact government made a profit. If were lucky and we do it right, that could potentially happen but in the short term theres an outlay and we may not see that money for a while. And because of the economys slowing down, I think we can also expect less tax revenue so theres no doubt that as president Im going to have to make some tough decision. The only point I want to make is this, that in order to make those tough decisions we have to know what our values are and who were fighting for and what our priorities are and if we are spending $300 billion on tax cuts for people who dont need them and werent even asking for them, and we are leaving out health care which is crushing on people all across the country, then I think we have made a bad decision and I want to make sure were not shortchanging our long term priorities.",2008-09-26,Democrat
Mccain,"Well, I want to make sure were not handing the health care system over to the federal government which is basically what would ultimately happen with Senator Obamas health care plan. I want the families to make decisions between themselves and their doctors. Not the federal government. Look. We have to obviously cut spending. I have fought to cut spending. Senator Obama has $800 billion in new spending programs. I would suggest he start by canceling some of those new spending program that he has. We cant I think adjust spending around to take care of the very much needed programs, including taking care of our veterans but I also want to say again a healthy economy with low taxes would not raising anyones taxes is probably the best recipe for eventually having our economy recover. And spending restraint has got to be a vital part of that. And the reason, one of the major reasons why were in the difficulties we are in today is because spending got out of control. We owe China $500 billion. And spending, I know, can be brought under control because I have fought against excessive spending my entire career. And I got plans to reduce and eliminate unnecessary and wasteful spending and if theres anybody here who thinks there arent agencies of government where spending can be cut and their budgets slashed they have not spent a lot of time in Washington.",2008-09-26,Republican
Obama,"I just want to make this point, Jim. John, its been your president who you said you agreed with 90 percent of the time who presided over this increase in spending. This orgy of spending and enormous deficits you voted for almost all of his budgets. So to stand here and after eight years and say that youre going to lead on controlling spending and, you know, balancing our tax cuts so that they help middle class families when over the last eight years that hasnt happened I think just is, you know, kind of hard to swallow.",2008-09-26,Democrat

Mccain,"I think the lessons of Iraq are very clear that you cannot have a failed strategy that will then cause you to nearly lose a conflict. Our initial military success, we went in to Baghdad and everybody celebrated. And then the war was very badly mishandled. I went to Iraq in 2003 and came back and said, weve got to change this strategy. This strategy requires additional troops, it requires a fundamental change in strategy and I fought for it. And finally, we came up with a great general and a strategy that has succeeded. This strategy has succeeded. And we are winning in Iraq. And we will come home with victory and with honor. And that withdrawal is the result of every counterinsurgency that succeeds.",2008-09-26,Republican
Mccain,"And I want to tell you that now that we will succeed and our troops will come home, and not in defeat, that we will see a stable ally in the region and a fledgling democracy. The consequences of defeat would have been increased Iranian influence. It would have been increase in sectarian violence. It would have been a wider war, which the United States of America might have had to come back. So there was a lot at stake there. And thanks to this great general, David Petraeus, and the troops who serve under him, they have succeeded. And we are winning in Iraq, and we will come home. And we will come home as we have when we have won other wars and not in defeat.",2008-09-26,Republican

Now six years ago, I stood up and opposed this war at a time when it was politically risky to do so because I said that not only did we not know how much it was going to cost, what our exit strategy might be, how it would affect our relationships around the world, and whether our intelligence was sound, but also because we hadnt finished the job in Afghanistan. We hadnt caught bin Laden. We hadnt put al Qaeda to rest, and as a consequence, I thought that it was going to be a distraction. Now Senator McCain and President Bush had a very different judgment. And I wish I had been wrong for the sake of the country and they had been right, but thats not the case. Weve spent over $600 billion so far, soon to be $1 trillion. We have lost over 4,000 lives. We have seen 30,000 wounded, and most importantly, from a strategic national security perspective, al Qaeda is resurgent, stronger now than at any time since 2001. We took our eye off the ball. And not to mention that we are still spending $10 billion a month, when they have a $79 billion surplus, at a time when we are in great distress here at home, and we just talked about the fact that our budget is way overstretched and we are borrowing money from overseas to try to finance just some of the basic functions of our government. So I think the lesson to be drawn is that we should never hesitate to use military force, and I will not, as president, in order to keep the American people safe. But we have to use our military wisely. And we did not use our military wisely in Iraq.",2008-09-26,Democrat

Senator Obama said the surge could not work, said it would increase sectarian violence, said it was doomed to failure. Recently on a television program, he said it exceed our wildest expectations. But yet, after conceding that, he still says that he would oppose the surge if he had to decide that again today.

But thats Senate inside baseball. But lets get back to the core issue here. Senator McCain is absolutely right that the violence has been reduced as a consequence of the extraordinary sacrifice of our troops and our military families. They have done a brilliant job, and General Petraeus has done a brilliant job. But understand, that was a tactic designed to contain the damage of the previous four years of mismanagement of this war. And so John likes  John, you like to pretend like the war started in 2007.

I was honored to be there. I was honored to speak to those troops. And you know, afterwards, we spent a lot of time with them. And you know what they said to us? They said, let us win.

And Senator Obama, who after promising not to vote to cut off funds for the troops, did the incredible thing of voting to cut off the funds for the troops in Iraq and Afghanistan.",2008-09-26,Republican
Obama,"Jim, there are a whole bunch of things we have got to answer. First of all, lets talk about this troop funding issue because John always brings this up. Senator McCain cut  Senator McCain opposed funding for troops in legislation that had a timetable, because he didnt believe in a timetable. I opposed funding a mission that had no timetable, and was open- ended, giving a blank check to George Bush. We had a difference on the timetable. We didnt have a difference on whether or not we were going to be funding troops. We had a legitimate difference, and I absolutely understand the difference between tactics and strategy. And the strategic question that the president has to ask is not whether or not we are employing a particular approach in the country once we have made the decision to be there. The question is, was this wise? We have seen Afghanistan worsen, deteriorate. We need more troops there. We need more resources there. Senator McCain, in the rush to go into Iraq, said, you know what? Weve been successful in Afghanistan. There is nobody who can pose a threat to us there. This is a time when bin Laden was still out, and now theyve reconstituted themselves. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates himself acknowledges the war on terrorism started in Afghanistan and it needs to end there. But we cant do it if we are not willing to give Iraq back its country. Now, what Ive said is we should end this war responsibly. We should do it in phases. But in 16 months we should be able to reduce our combat troops, put  provide some relief to military families and our troops and bolster our efforts in Afghanistan so that we can capture and kill bin Laden and crush al Qaeda. And right now, the commanders in Afghanistan, as well as Admiral Mullen, have acknowledged that we dont have enough troops to deal with Afghanistan because we still have more troops in Iraq than we did before the surge.",2008-09-26,Democrat

Mccain,"And also General Petraeus said the same thing. Osama bin Laden and General Petraeus have one thing in common that I know of, they both said that Iraq is the central battleground. Now General Petraeus has praised the successes, but he said those successes are fragile and if we set a specific date for withdrawal  and by the way, Senator Obamas original plan, they would have been out last spring before the surge ever had a chance to succeed. And Im  Im  understand why Senator Obama was surprised and said that the surge succeeded beyond his wildest expectations.",2008-09-26,Republican
Mccain,"It didnt exceed beyond mine, because I know that thats a strategy that has worked and can succeed. But if we snatch defeat from the jaws of victory and adopt Senator Obamas plan, then we will have a wider war and it will make things more complicated throughout the region, including in Afghanistan.",2008-09-26,Republican
Lehrer,"Afghanistan, lead  a new  a new lead question. Now, having resolved Iraq, well move to Afghanistan.",2008-09-26,Moderator
Obama,"Yes, I think we need more troops. Ive been saying that for over a year now. And I think that we have to do it as quickly as possible, because its been acknowledged by the commanders on the ground the situation is getting worse, not better. We had the highest fatalities among U.S. troops this past year than at any time since 2002. And we are seeing a major offensive taking place  Al Qaida and Taliban crossing the border and attacking our troops in a brazen fashion. They are feeling emboldened. And we cannot separate Afghanistan from Iraq, because what our commanders have said is we dont have the troops right now to deal with Afghanistan. So I would send two to three additional brigades to Afghanistan. Now, keep in mind that we have four times the number of troops in Iraq, where nobody had anything to do with 9/11 before we went in, where, in fact, there was no Al Qaida before we went in, but we have four times more troops there than we do in Afghanistan. And that is a strategic mistake, because every intelligence agency will acknowledge that Al Qaida is the greatest threat against the United States and that Secretary of Defense Gates acknowledged the central front  that the place where we have to deal with these folks is going to be in Afghanistan and in Pakistan. So heres what we have to do comprehensively, though. Its not just more troops. We have to press the Afghan government to make certain that they are actually working for their people. And Ive said this to President Karzai. Number two, weve got to deal with a growing poppy trade that has exploded over the last several years. Number three, weve got to deal with Pakistan, because Al Qaida and the Taliban have safe havens in Pakistan, across the border in the northwest regions, and although, you know, under George Bush, with the support of Senator McCain, weve been giving them $10 billion over the last seven years, they have not done what needs to be done to get rid of those safe havens. And until we do, Americans here at home are not going to be safe.",2008-09-26,Democrat
Lehrer,"Afghanistan, Senator McCain?",2008-09-26,Moderator
Mccain,"First of all, I wont repeat the mistake that I regret enormously, and that is, after we were able to help the Afghan freedom fighters and drive the Russians out of Afghanistan, we basically washed our hands of the region. And the result over time was the Taliban, Al Qaida, and a lot of the difficulties we are facing today. So we cant ignore those lessons of history. Now, on this issue of aiding Pakistan, if youre going to aim a gun at somebody, George Shultz, our great secretary of state, told me once, youd better be prepared to pull the trigger. Im not prepared at this time to cut off aid to Pakistan. So Im not prepared to threaten it, as Senator Obama apparently wants to do, as he has said that he would announce military strikes into Pakistan. Weve got to get the support of the people of  of Pakistan. He said that he would launch military strikes into Pakistan. Now, you dont do that. You dont say that out loud. If you have to do things, you have to do things, and you work with the Pakistani government. Now, the new president of Pakistan, Kardari (sic), has got his hands full. And this area on the border has not been governed since the days of Alexander the Great. Ive been to Waziristan. I can see how tough that terrain is. Its ruled by a handful of tribes. And, yes, Senator Obama calls for more troops, but what he doesnt understand, its got to be a new strategy, the same strategy that he condemned in Iraq. Its going to have to be employed in Afghanistan. And were going to have to help the Pakistanis go into these areas and obtain the allegiance of the people. And its going to be tough. Theyve intermarried with Al Qaida and the Taliban. And its going to be tough. But we have to get the cooperation of the people in those areas. And the Pakistanis are going to have to understand that that bombing in the Marriott Hotel in Islamabad was a signal from the terrorists that they dont want that government to cooperate with us in combating the Taliban and jihadist elements. So weve got a lot of work to do in Afghanistan. But Im confident, now that General Petraeus is in the new position of command, that we will employ a strategy which not only means additional troops  and, by the way, there have been 20,000 additional troops, from 32,000 to 53,000, and there needs to be more. So its not just the addition of troops that matters. Its a strategy that will succeed. And Pakistan is a very important element in this. And I know how to work with them. And I guarantee you I would not publicly state that Im going to attack them.",2008-09-26,Republican
Obama,"Nobody talked about attacking Pakistan. Heres what I said. And if John wants to disagree with this, he can let me know, that, if the United States has Al Qaida, bin Laden, top-level lieutenants in our sights, and Pakistan is unable or unwilling to act, then we should take them out. Now, I think thats the right strategy; I think thats the right policy. And, John, I  youre absolutely right that presidents have to be prudent in what they say. But, you know, coming from you, who, you know, in the past has threatened extinction for North Korea and, you know, sung songs about bombing Iran, I dont know, you know, how credible that is. I think this is the right strategy. Now, Senator McCain is also right that its difficult. This is not an easy situation. Youve got cross-border attacks against U.S. troops. And weve got a choice. We could allow our troops to just be on the defensive and absorb those blows again and again and again, if Pakistan is unwilling to cooperate, or we have to start making some decisions. And the problem, John, with the strategy thats been pursued was that, for 10 years, we coddled Musharraf, we alienated the Pakistani population, because we were anti-democratic. We had a 20th-century mindset that basically said, Well, you know, he may be a dictator, but hes our dictator. And as a consequence, we lost legitimacy in Pakistan. We spent $10 billion. And in the meantime, they werent going after Al Qaida, and they are more powerful now than at any time since we began the war in Afghanistan. Thats going to change when Im president of the United States.",2008-09-26,Democrat
Mccain,"I  I dont think that Senator Obama understands that there was a failed state in Pakistan when Musharraf came to power. Everybody who was around then, and had been there, and knew about it knew that it was a failed state. But let me tell you, you know, this business about bombing Iran and all that, let me tell you my record. Back in 1983, when I was a brand-new United States congressman, the one  the person I admired the most and still admire the most, Ronald Reagan, wanted to send Marines into Lebanon. And I saw that, and I saw the situation, and I stood up, and I voted against that, because I was afraid that they couldnt make peace in a place where 300 or 400 or several hundred Marines would make a difference. Tragically, I was right: Nearly 300 Marines lost their lives in the bombing of the barracks. And then we had Somalia  then we had the first Gulf War. I supported  I supported that. I supported us going into Bosnia, when a number of my own party and colleagues was against that operation in Bosnia. That was the right thing to do, to stop genocide and to preserve what was necessary inside of Europe. I supported what we did in Kosovo. I supported it because ethnic cleansing and genocide was taking place there. And I have a record  and Somalia, I opposed that we should turn  turn the force in Somalia from a peacekeeping force into a peacemaking force, which they were not capable of. So I have a record. I have a record of being involved in these national security issues, which involve the highest responsibility and the toughest decisions that any president can make, and that is to send our young men and women into harms way. And Ill tell you, I had a town hall meeting in Wolfeboro, New Hampshire, and a woman stood up and she said, Senator McCain, I want you to do me the honor of wearing a bracelet with my sons name on it. He was 22 years old and he was killed in combat outside of Baghdad, Matthew Stanley, before Christmas last year. This was last August, a year ago. And I said, I will  I will wear his bracelet with honor. And this was August, a year ago. And then she said, But, Senator McCain, I want you to do everything  promise me one thing, that youll do everything in your power to make sure that my sons death was not in vain. That means that that mission succeeds, just like those young people who re-enlisted in Baghdad, just like the mother I met at the airport the other day whose son was killed. And they all say to me that we dont want defeat. I know what thats like when an army is defeated.",2008-09-26,Republican
Mccain,"A war that I was in, where we had an Army, that it wasnt through any fault of their own, but they were defeated. And I know how hard it is for that  for an Army and a military to recover from that. And it did and we will win this one and we wont come home in defeat and dishonor and probably have to go back if we fail.",2008-09-26,Republican
Obama,"Jim, let me just make a point. Ive got a bracelet, too, from Sergeant  from the mother of Sergeant Ryan David Jopeck (ph), given to me in green bay. She asked me, can you please make sure another mother is not going through what Im going through. No U.S. soldier ever dies in vain because theyre carrying out the missions of their commander in chief. And we honor all the service that theyve provided. Our troops have performed brilliantly. The question is for the next president, are we making good judgments about how to keep America safe precisely because sending our military into battle is such an enormous step. And the point that I originally made is that we took our eye off Afghanistan, we took our eye off the folks who perpetrated 9/11, they are still sending out videotapes and Senator McCain, nobody is talking about defeat in Iraq, but I have to say we are having enormous problems in Afghanistan because of that decision. And it is not true you have consistently been concerned about what happened in Afghanistan. At one point, while you were focused on Iraq, you said well, we can muddle through Afghanistan. You dont muddle through the central front on terror and you dont muddle through going after bin Laden. You dont muddle through stamping out the Taliban.

I know what our needs are. So the point is that we will prevail in Afghanistan, but we need the new strategy and we need it to succeed. But the important thing is, if we suffer defeat in Iraq, which General Petraeus predicts we will, if we adopted Senator Obamas set date for withdrawal, then that will have a calamitous effect in Afghanistan and American national security interests in the region.

Mccain,"My reading of the threat from Iran is that if Iran acquires nuclear weapons, it is an existential threat to the State of Israel and it is a threat to other countries in the region because the other countries in the region will feel compelling requirement to acquire nuclear weapons as well. Now we cannot allow a second Holocaust. Lets just make that very clear. What I have proposed for a long time, and Ive had conversation with foreign leaders about forming a league of democracies, lets be clear and lets have some straight talk. The Russians are preventing significant action in the United Nations Security Council. I have proposed a league of democracies, a group of people  a group of countries that share common interests, common values, common ideals, they also control a lot of the worlds economic power. We could impose significant meaningful, painful sanctions on the Iranians that I think could have a beneficial effect. The Iranians have a lousy government, so therefore their economy is lousy, even though they have significant oil revenues. So I am convinced that together, we can, with the French, with the British, with the Germans and other countries, democracies around the world, we can affect Iranian behavior. But have no doubt, but have no doubt that the Iranians continue on the path to the acquisition of a nuclear weapon as we speak tonight. And it is a threat not only in this region but around the world. What Id also like to point out the Iranians are putting the most lethal IEDs into Iraq which are killing young Americans, there are special groups in Iran coming into Iraq and are being trained in Iran. There is the Republican Guard in Iran, which Senator Kyl had an amendment in order to declare them a sponsor of terror. Senator Obama said that would be provocative. So this is a serious threat. This is a serious threat to security in the world, and I believe we can act and we can act with our friends and allies and reduce that threat as quickly as possible, but have no doubt about the ultimate result of them acquiring nuclear weapons.",2008-09-26,Republican
Lehrer,"Two minutes on Iran, Senator Obama.",2008-09-26,Moderator
Obama,"Well, let me just correct something very quickly. I believe the Republican Guard of Iran is a terrorist organization. Ive consistently said so. What Senator McCain refers to is a measure in the Senate that would try to broaden the mandate inside of Iraq. To deal with Iran. And ironically, the single thing that has strengthened Iran over the last several years has been the war in Iraq. Iraq was Irans mortal enemy. That was cleared away. And what weve seen over the last several years is Irans influence grow. They have funded Hezbollah, they have funded Hamas, they have gone from zero centrifuges to 4,000 centrifuges to develop a nuclear weapon. So obviously, our policy over the last eight years has not worked. Senator McCain is absolutely right, we cannot tolerate a nuclear Iran. It would be a game changer. Not only would it threaten Israel, a country that is our stalwart ally, but it would also create an environment in which you could set off an arms race in this Middle East. Now heres what we need to do. We do need tougher sanctions. I do not agree with Senator McCain that were going to be able to execute the kind of sanctions we need without some cooperation with countries like Russia and China that are, I think Senator McCain would agree, not democracies, but have extensive trade with Iran but potentially have an interest in making sure Iran doesnt have a nuclear weapon. But we are also going to have to, I believe, engage in tough direct diplomacy with Iran and this is a major difference I have with Senator McCain, this notion that by not talking to people we are punishing them has not worked. It has not worked in Iran, it has not worked in North Korea. In each instance, our efforts at isolation have actually accelerated their efforts to get nuclear weapons.

The point is that throughout history, whether it be Ronald Reagan, who wouldnt sit down with Brezhnev, Andropov or Chernenko until Gorbachev was ready with glasnost and perestroika. Or whether it be Nixons trip to China, which was preceded by Henry Kissinger, many times before he went. Look, Ill sit down with anybody, but theres got to be pre-conditions. Those pre-conditions would apply that we wouldnt legitimize with a face to face meeting, a person like Ahmadinejad. Now, Senator Obama said, without preconditions.",2008-09-26,Republican

But I reserve the right, as president of the United States to meet with anybody at a time and place of my choosing if I think its going to keep America safe. And Im glad that Senator McCain brought up the history, the bipartisan history of us engaging in direct diplomacy.",2008-09-26,Democrat
Obama,"Senator McCain mentioned Henry Kissinger, whos one of his advisers, who, along with five recent secretaries of state, just said that we should meet with Iran  guess what  without precondition. This is one of your own advisers. Now, understand what this means without preconditions. It doesnt mean that you invite them over for tea one day. What it means is that we dont do what weve been doing, which is to say, Until you agree to do exactly what we say, we wont have direct contacts with you. Theres a difference between preconditions and preparation. Of course weve got to do preparations, starting with low-level diplomatic talks, and it may not work, because Iran is a rogue regime. But I will point out that I was called naive when I suggested that we need to look at exploring contacts with Iran. And you know what? President Bush recently sent a senior ambassador, Bill Burns, to participate in talks with the Europeans around the issue of nuclear weapons. Again, it may not work, but if it doesnt work, then we have strengthened our ability to form alliances to impose the tough sanctions that Senator McCain just mentioned. And when we havent done it, as in North Korea  let me just take one more example  in North Korea, we cut off talks. Theyre a member of the axis of evil. We cant deal with them. And you know what happened? They went  they quadrupled their nuclear capacity. They tested a nuke. They tested missiles. They pulled out of the nonproliferation agreement. And they sent nuclear secrets, potentially, to countries like Syria. When we re-engaged  because, again, the Bush administration reversed course on this  then we have at least made some progress, although right now, because of the problems in North Korea, we are seeing it on shaky ground. And  and I just  so I just have to make this general point that the Bush administration, some of Senator McCains own advisers all think this is important, and Senator McCain appears resistant. He even said the other day that he would not meet potentially with the prime minister of Spain, because he  you know, he wasnt sure whether they were aligned with us. I mean, Spain?

This is dangerous. It isnt just naive; its dangerous. And so we just have a fundamental difference of opinion. As far as North Korea is concerned, our secretary of state, Madeleine Albright, went to North Korea. By the way, North Korea, most repressive and brutal regime probably on Earth. The average South Korean is three inches taller than the average North Korean, a huge gulag. We dont know what the status of the dear leaders health is today, but we know this, that the North Koreans have broken every agreement that theyve entered into.

Lehrer,New lead question.,2008-09-26,Moderator
Obama,"Well, I think that, given whats happened over the last several weeks and months, our entire Russian approach has to be evaluated, because a resurgent and very aggressive Russia is a threat to the peace and stability of the region. Their actions in Georgia were unacceptable. They were unwarranted. And at this point, it is absolutely critical for the next president to make clear that we have to follow through on our six-party  or the six-point cease-fire. They have to remove themselves from South Ossetia and Abkhazia. It is absolutely important that we have a unified alliance and that we explain to the Russians that you cannot be a 21st-century superpower, or power, and act like a 20th-century dictatorship. And we also have to affirm all the fledgling democracies in that region, you know, the Estonians, the Lithuanians, the Latvians, the Poles, the Czechs, that we are, in fact, going to be supportive and in solidarity with them in their efforts. They are members of NATO. And to countries like Georgia and the Ukraine, I think we have to insist that they are free to join NATO if they meet the requirements, and they should have a membership action plan immediately to start bringing them in. Now, we also cant return to a Cold War posture with respect to Russia. Its important that we recognize there are going to be some areas of common interest. One is nuclear proliferation. They have not only 15,000 nuclear warheads, but theyve got enough to make another 40,000, and some of those loose nukes could fall into the hands of Al Qaida. This is an area where Ive led on in the Senate, working with a Republican ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Dick Lugar, to deal with the proliferation of loose nuclear weapons. Thats an area where were going to have to work with Russia. And we have to recognize that the way theyve been behaving lately demands a sharp response from the international community and our allies.",2008-09-26,Democrat
Lehrer,"Two minutes on Russia, Senator McCain.",2008-09-26,Moderator
Mccain,"Well, I was interested in Senator Obamas reaction to the Russian aggression against Georgia. His first statement was, Both sides ought to show restraint. Again, a little bit of naivete there. He doesnt understand that Russia committed serious aggression against Georgia. And Russia has now become a nation fueled by petro-dollars that is basically a KGB apparatchik-run government. I looked into Mr. Putins eyes, and I saw three letters, a K, a G, and a B. And their aggression in Georgia is not acceptable behavior. I dont believe were going to go back to the Cold War. I am sure that that will not happen. But I do believe that we need to bolster our friends and allies. And that wasnt just about a problem between Georgia and Russia. It had everything to do with energy. Theres a pipeline that runs from the Caspian through Georgia through Turkey. And, of course, we know that the Russians control other sources of energy into Europe, which they have used from time to time. Its not accidental that the presidents of Latvia, Estonia, Lithuania, Poland, and Ukraine flew to Georgia, flew to Tbilisi, where I have spent significant amount of time with a great young president, Misha Saakashvili.",2008-09-26,Republican
Mccain,"And they showed solidarity with them, but, also, they are very concerned about the Russian threats to regain their status of the old Russian to regain their status of the old Russian empire. Now, I think the Russians ought to understand that we will support  we, the United States  will support the inclusion of Georgia and Ukraine in the natural process, inclusion into NATO. We also ought to make it very clear that the Russians are in violation of their cease-fire agreement. They have stationed additional troops in Abkhazia and South Ossetia. By the way, I went there once, and we went inside and drove in, and there was a huge poster. And this is  this is Georgian territory. And there was a huge poster of Vladimir Putin, and it said, Vladimir Putin, our president. It was very clear, the Russian intentions towards Georgia. They were just waiting to seize the opportunity. So, this is a very difficult situation. We want to work with the Russians. But we also have every right to expect the Russians to behave in a fashion and keeping with a  with a  with a country who respects international boundaries and the norms of international behavior. And watch Ukraine. This whole thing has got a lot to do with Ukraine, Crimea, the base of the Russian fleet in Sevastopol. And the breakdown of the political process in Ukraine between Tymoshenko and Yushchenko is a very serious problem. So watch Ukraine, and lets make sure that we  that the Ukrainians understand that we are their friend and ally.",2008-09-26,Republican
Lehrer,You see any  do you have a major difference with what he just said?,2008-09-26,Moderator
Obama,"No, actually, I think Senator McCain and I agree for the most part on these issues. Obviously, I disagree with this notion that somehow we did not forcefully object to Russians going into Georgia. I immediately said that this was illegal and objectionable. And, absolutely, I wanted a cessation of the violence, because it put an enormous strain on Georgia, and thats why I was the first to say that we have to rebuild the Georgian economy and called for a billion dollars that has now gone in to help them rebuild. Because part of Russias intentions here was to weaken the economy to the point where President Saakashvili was so weakened that he might be replaced by somebody that Putin favored more. Two points I think are important to think about when it comes to Russia. Number one is we have to have foresight and anticipate some of these problems. So back in April, I warned the administration that you had Russian peacekeepers in Georgian territory. That made no sense whatsoever. And what we needed to do was replace them with international peacekeepers and a special envoy to resolve the crisis before it boiled over. That wasnt done. But had it been done, its possible we could have avoided the issue. The second point I want to make is  is the issue of energy. Russia is in part resurgent and Putin is feeling powerful because of petro-dollars, as Senator McCain mentioned. That means that we, as one of the biggest consumers of oil  25 percent of the worlds oil  have to have an energy strategy not just to deal with Russia, but to deal with many of the rogue states weve talked about, Iran, Venezuela. And that means, yes, increasing domestic production and off-shore drilling, but we only have 3 percent of the worlds oil supplies and we use 25 percent of the worlds oil. So we cant simply drill our way out of the problem. What were going to have to do is to approach it through alternative energy, like solar, and wind, and biodiesel, and, yes, nuclear energy, clean-coal technology. And, you know, Ive got a plan for us to make a significant investment over the next 10 years to do that. And I have to say, Senator McCain and I, I think agree on the importance of energy, but Senator McCain mentioned earlier the importance of looking at a record. Over 26 years, Senator McCain voted 23 times against alternative energy, like solar, and wind, and biodiesel. And so we  we  weve got to walk the walk and not just talk the talk when it comes to energy independence, because this is probably going to be just as vital for our economy and the pain that people are feeling at the pump  and, you know, winters coming and home heating oil  as it is our national security and the issue of climate change thats so important.",2008-09-26,Democrat

Obama,"Thats just not true, John. John, Im sorry, but thats not true.",2008-09-26,Democrat
Mccain," its hard to get there from here. And off-shore drilling is also something that is very important and it is a bridge. And we know that, if we drill off-shore and exploit a lot of these reserves, it will help, at temporarily, relieve our energy requirements. And it will have, I think, an important effect on the price of a barrel of oil.",2008-09-26,Republican

Lehrer,"This is the last  last lead question. You have two minutes each. And the question is this, beginning with you, Senator McCain.",2008-09-26,Moderator
Mccain,"I think its much less than it was the day after 9/11. I think it  that we have a safer nation, but we are a long way from safe. And I want to tell you that one of the things Im most proud of, among others, because I have worked across the aisle. I have a long record on that, on a long series of reforms. But after 9/11, Senator Joe Lieberman and I decided that we needed a commission, and that was a commission to investigate 9/11, and find out what happened, and fix it. And we were  we were opposed by the administration, another area where I differed with this administration. And we were stymied until the families of 9/11 came, and they descended on Washington, and we got that legislation passed. And there were a series of recommendations, as I recall, more than 40. And Im happy to say that weve gotten written into law most of those reforms recommended by that commission. Im proud of that work, again, bipartisan, reaching across the aisle, working together, Democrat and Republican alike. So we have a long way to go in our intelligence services. We have to do a better job in human intelligence. And weve got to  to make sure that we have people who are trained interrogators so that we dont ever torture a prisoner ever again. We have to make sure that our technological and intelligence capabilities are better. We have to work more closely with our allies. I know our allies, and I can work much more closely with them. But I can tell you that I think America is safer today than it was on 9/11. But that doesnt mean that we dont have a long way to go. And Id like to remind you, also, as a result of those recommendations, weve probably had the largest reorganization of government since we established the Defense Department. And I think that those men and women in those agencies are doing a great job. But we still have a long way to go before we can declare America safe, and that means doing a better job along our borders, as well.",2008-09-26,Republican
Lehrer,"Two minutes, Senator Obama.",2008-09-26,Moderator
Obama,"Well, first of all, I think that we are safer in some ways. Obviously, weve poured billions of dollars into airport security. We have done some work in terms of securing potential targets, but we still have a long way to go. Weve got to make sure that were hardening our chemical sites. We havent done enough in terms of transit; we havent done enough in terms of ports. And the biggest threat that we face right now is not a nuclear missile coming over the skies. Its in a suitcase. This is why the issue of nuclear proliferation is so important. It is the  the biggest threat to the United States is a terrorist getting their hands on nuclear weapons. And we  we are spending billions of dollars on missile defense. And I actually believe that we need missile defense, because of Iran and North Korea and the potential for them to obtain or to launch nuclear weapons, but I also believe that, when we are only spending a few hundred million dollars on nuclear proliferation, then were making a mistake. The other thing that we have to focus on, though, is Al Qaida. They are now operating in 60 countries. We cant simply be focused on Iraq. We have to go to the root cause, and that is in Afghanistan and Pakistan. Thats going to be critical. We are going to need more cooperation with our allies. And one last point I want to make. It is important for us to understand that the way we are perceived in the world is going to make a difference, in terms of our capacity to get cooperation and root out terrorism. And one of the things that I intend to do as president is to restore Americas standing in the world. We are less respected now than we were eight years ago or even four years ago.",2008-09-26,Democrat
Obama,"And this is the greatest country on Earth. But because of some of the mistakes that have been made  and I give Senator McCain great credit on the torture issue, for having identified that as something that undermines our long-term security  because of those things, we, I think, are going to have a lot of work to do in the next administration to restore that sense that America is that shining beacon on a hill.",2008-09-26,Democrat
Lehrer,Do you agree theres much to be done in a new administration to restore,2008-09-26,Moderator
Mccain,"But in the case of missile defense, Senator Obama said it had to be, quote, proven. That wasnt proven when Ronald Reagan said we would do SDI, which is missile defense. And it was major  a major factor in bringing about the end of the Cold War. We seem to come full circle again. Senator Obama still doesnt quite understand  or doesnt get it  that if we fail in Iraq, it encourages Al Qaida. They would establish a base in Iraq. The consequences of defeat, which would result from his plan of withdrawal and according to date certain, regardless of conditions, according to our military leaders, according to every expert, would lead to defeat  possible defeat, loss of all the fragile sacrifice that weve made of American blood and treasure, which grieves us all. All of that would be lost if we followed Senator Obamas plan to have specific dates with withdrawal, regardless of conditions on the ground. And General Petraeus says we have had great success, but its very fragile. And we cant do what Senator Obama wants to do. That is the central issue of our time. And I think Americans will judge very seriously as to whether thats the right path or the wrong path and who should be the next president of the United States.",2008-09-26,Republican
Lehrer,You see the same connections that Senator McCain does?,2008-09-26,Moderator
Obama,"Oh, theres no doubt. Look, over the last eight years, this administration, along with Senator McCain, have been solely focused on Iraq. That has been their priority. That has been where all our resources have gone. In the meantime, bin Laden is still out there. He is not captured. He is not killed. Al Qaida is resurgent. In the meantime, weve got challenges, for example, with China, where we are borrowing billions of dollars. They now hold a trillion dollars worth of our debt. And they are active in countries like  in regions like Latin America, and Asia, and Africa. They are  the conspicuousness of their presence is only matched by our absence, because weve been focused on Iraq. We have weakened our capacity to project power around the world because we have viewed everything through this single lens, not to mention, look at our economy. We are now spending $10 billion or more every month. And that means we cant provide health care to people who need it. We cant invest in science and technology, which will determine whether or not we are going to be competitive in the long term. There has never been a country on Earth that saw its economy decline and yet maintained its military superiority. So this is a national security issue. We havent adequately funded veterans care. I sit on the Veterans Affairs Committee, and weve got  I meet veterans all across the country who are trying to figure out, How can I get disability payments? Ive got post-traumatic stress disorder, and yet I cant get treatment. So we have put all chips in, right there, and nobody is talking about losing this war. What we are talking about is recognizing that the next president has to have a broader strategic vision about all the challenges that we face. Thats been missing over the last eight years. That sense is something that I want to restore.",2008-09-26,Democrat
Mccain,"Ive been involved, as I mentioned to you before, in virtually every major national security challenge weve faced in the last 20-some years. There are some advantages to experience, and knowledge, and judgment. And I  and I honestly dont believe that Senator Obama has the knowledge or experience and has made the wrong judgments in a number of areas, including his initial reaction to Russian invasion  aggression in Georgia, to his  you know, weve seen this stubbornness before in this administration to cling to a belief that somehow the surge has not succeeded and failing to acknowledge that he was wrong about the surge is  shows to me that we  that  that we need more flexibility in a president of the United States than that. As far as our other issues that he brought up are concerned, I know the veterans. I know them well. And I know that they know that Ill take care of them. And Ive been proud of their support and their recognition of my service to the veterans. And I love them. And Ill take care of them. And they know that Ill take care of them. And thats going to be my job. But, also, I have the ability, and the knowledge, and the background to make the right judgments, to keep this country safe and secure. Reform, prosperity, and peace, these are major challenges to the United States of America. I dont think I need any on-the-job training. Im ready to go at it right now.",2008-09-26,Republican
Obama,"Well, let me just make a closing point. You know, my father came from Kenya. Thats where I get my name. And in the 60s, he wrote letter after letter to come to college here in the United States because the notion was that there was no other country on Earth where you could make it if you tried. The ideals and the values of the United States inspired the entire world. I dont think any of us can say that our standing in the world now, the way children around the world look at the United States, is the same. And part of what we need to do, what the next president has to do  and this is part of our judgment, this is part of how were going to keep America safe  is to  to send a message to the world that we are going to invest in issues like education, we are going to invest in issues that  that relate to how ordinary people are able to live out their dreams. And that is something that Im going to be committed to as president of the United States.",2008-09-26,Democrat

Yes, I think that thats a very good question, because Ive heard from lots of teachers and parents about some of their concerns about some of the things that are being said and done in this campaign. And I think it is very important for us to make clear to our children that our country really is great because were good. And we are going to respect one another, lift each other up. We are going to be looking for ways to celebrate our diversity, and we are going to try to reach out to every boy and girl, as well as every adult, to bring them in to working on behalf of our country. I have a very positive and optimistic view about what we can do together. Thats why the slogan of my campaign is Stronger Together, because I think if we work together, if we overcome the divisiveness that sometimes sets Americans against one another, and instead we make some big goalsand Ive set forth some big goals, getting the economy to work for everyone, not just those at the top, making sure that we have the best education system from preschool through college and making it affordable, and so much else. If we set those goals and we go together to try to achieve them, theres nothing in my opinion that America cant do. So thats why I hope that we will come together in this campaign. Obviously, Im hoping to earn your vote, Im hoping to be elected in November, and I can promise you, I will work with every American. I want to be the president for all Americans, regardless of your political beliefs, where you come from, what you look like, your religion.

Trump,"Well, I actually agree with that. I agree with everything she said. I began this campaign because I was so tired of seeing such foolish things happen to our country. This is a great country. This is a great land. Ive gotten to know the people of the country over the last year-and-a-half that Ive been doing this as a politician. I cannot believe Im saying that about myself, but I guess I have been a politician. And my whole concept was to make America great again. When I watch the deals being made, when I watch whats happening with some horrible things like Obamacare, where your health insurance and health care is going up by numbers that are astronomical, 68 percent, 59 percent, 71 percent, when I look at the Iran deal and how bad a deal it is for us, its a one-sided transaction where were giving back $150 billion to a terrorist state, really, the number one terror state, weve made them a strong country from really a very weak country just three years ago. When I look at all of the things that I see and all of the potential that our country has, we have such tremendous potential, whether its in business and trade, where were doing so badly. Last year, we had an almost $800 billion trade deficit. In other words, trading with other countries. We had an $800 billion deficit. Its hard to believe. Inconceivable. You say whos making these deals? Were going to make great trade deals. Were going to have a strong border. Were going to bring back law and order. Just today, policemen was shot, two killed. And this is happening on a weekly basis. We have to bring back respect to law enforcement. At the same time, we have to take care of people on all sides. We need justice. But I want to do things that havent been done, including fixing and making our inner cities better for the African-American citizens that are so great, and for the Latinos, Hispanics, and I look forward to doing it.

We havent seen anything like this, the carnage all over the world. And they look and they see. Can you imagine the people that are, frankly, doing so well against us with ISIS? And they look at our country and they see whats going on. Yes, Im very embarrassed by it. I hate it. But its locker room talk, and its one of those things. I will knock the hell out of ISIS.

Cooper,"Secretary Clinton, do you want to respond?",2016-10-09,Moderator
Clinton,"Well, like everyone else, Ive spent a lot of time thinking over the last 48 hours about what we heard and saw. You know, with prior Republican nominees for president, I disagreed with them on politics, policies, principles, but I never questioned their fitness to serve. Donald Trump is different. I said starting back in June that he was not fit to be president and commander-in-chief. And many Republicans and independents have said the same thing. What we all saw and heard on Friday was Donald talking about women, what he thinks about women, what he does to women. And he has said that the video doesnt represent who he is. But I think its clear to anyone who heard it that it represents exactly who he is. Because weve seen this throughout the campaign. We have seen him insult women. Weve seen him rate women on their appearance, ranking them from one to ten. Weve seen him embarrass women on TV and on Twitter. We saw him after the first debate spend nearly a week denigrating a former Miss Universe in the harshest, most personal terms. So, yes, this is who Donald Trump is. But its not only women, and its not only this video that raises questions about his fitness to be our president, because he has also targeted immigrants, African-Americans, Latinos, people with disabilities, POWs, Muslims, and so many others. So this is who Donald Trump is. And the question for us, the question our country must answer is that this is not who we are. Thats whyto go back to your questionI want to send a messagewe all shouldto every boy and girl and, indeed, to the entire world that America already is great, but we are great because we are good, and we will respect one another, and we will work with one another, and we will celebrate our diversity. These are very important values to me, because this is the America that I know and love. And I can pledge to you tonight that this is the America that I will serve if Im so fortunate enough to become your president.",2016-10-09,Democrat

Raddatz,"This tape is generating intense interest. In just 48 hours, its become the single most talked about story of the entire 2016 election on Facebook, with millions and millions of people discussing it on the social network. As we said a moment ago, we do want to bring in questions from voters around country via social media, and our first stays on this topic. Jeff from Ohio asks on Facebook, Trump says the campaign has changed him. When did that happen? So, Mr. Trump, let me add to that. When you walked off that bus at age 59, were you a different man or did that behavior continue until just recently? And you have two minutes for this.",2016-10-09,Moderator
Trump,"It was locker room talk, as I told you. That was locker room talk. Im not proud of it. I am a person who has great respect for people, for my family, for the people of this country. And certainly, Im not proud of it. But that was something that happened. If you look at Bill Clinton, far worse. Mine are words, and his was action. His was what hes done to women. Theres never been anybody in the history of politics in this nation thats been so abusive to women. So you can say any way you want to say it, but Bill Clinton was abusive to women. Hillary Clinton attacked those same women and attacked them viciously. Four of them here tonight. One of the women, who is a wonderful woman, at 12 years old, was raped at 12. Her client she represented got him off, and shes seen laughing on two separate occasions, laughing at the girl who was raped. Kathy Shelton, that young woman is here with us tonight. So dont tell me about words. I am absolutelyI apologize for those words. But it is things that people say. But what President Clinton did, he was impeached, he lost his license to practice law. He had to pay an $850,000 fine to one of the women. Paula Jones, whos also here tonight.",2016-10-09,Republican
Raddatz,"Can we please hold the applause? Secretary Clinton, you have two minutes.",2016-10-09,Moderator
Clinton,"Well, first, let me start by saying that so much of what hes just said is not right, but he gets to run his campaign any way he chooses. He gets to decide what he wants to talk about. Instead of answering peoples questions, talking about our agenda, laying out the plans that we have that we think can make a better life and a better country, thats his choice. And, look, if this were just about one video, maybe what hes saying tonight would be understandable, but everyone can draw their own conclusions at this point about whether or not the man in the video or the man on the stage respects women. But he never apologizes for anything to anyone. He never apologized to Mr. and Mrs. Khan, the Gold Star family whose son, Captain Khan, died in the line of duty in Iraq. And Donald insulted and attacked them for weeks over their religion. He never apologized to the distinguished federal judge who was born in Indiana, but Donald said he couldnt be trusted to be a judge because his parents were, quote, Mexican. He never apologized to the reporter that he mimicked and mocked on national television and our children were watching. And he never apologized for the racist lie that President Obama was not born in the United States of America. He owes the president an apology, he owes our country an apology, and he needs to take responsibility for his actions and his words.",2016-10-09,Democrat
Trump,"Well, you owe the president an apology, because as you know very well, your campaign, Sidney Blumenthalhes another real winner that you haveand hes the one that got this started, along with your campaign manager, and they were on television just two weeks ago, she was, saying exactly that. So you really owe him an apology. Youre the one that sent the pictures around your campaign, sent the pictures around with President Obama in a certain garb. That was long before I was ever involved, so you actually owe an apology. Number two, Michelle Obama. Ive gotten to see the commercials that they did on you. And Ive gotten to see some of the most vicious commercials Ive ever seen of Michelle Obama talking about you, Hillary. So, you talk about friend? Go back and take a look at those commercials, a race where you lost fair and square, unlike the Bernie Sanders race, where you won, but not fair and square, in my opinion. And all you have to do is take a look at WikiLeaks and just see what they said about Bernie Sanders and see what Deborah Wasserman Schultz had in mind, because Bernie Sanders, between super-delegates and Deborah Wasserman Schultz, he never had a chance. And I was so surprised to see him sign on with the devil. But when you talk about apology, I think the one that you should really be apologizing for and the thing that you should be apologizing for are the 33,000 e-mails that you deleted, and that you acid washed, and then the two boxes of e-mails and other things last week that were taken from an office and are now missing. And Ill tell you what. I didnt think Id say this, but Im going to say it, and I hate to say it. But if I win, I am going to instruct my attorney general to get a special prosecutor to look into your situation, because there has never been so many lies, so much deception. There has never been anything like it, and were going to have a special prosecutor. When I speak, I go out and speak, the people of this country are furious. In my opinion, the people that have been long-term workers at the FBI are furious. There has never been anything like this, where e-mailsand you get a subpoena, you get a subpoena, and after getting the subpoena, you delete 33,000 e-mails, and then you acid wash them or bleach them, as you would say, very expensive process. So were going to get a special prosecutor, and were going to look into it, because you know what? People have beentheir lives have been destroyed for doing one-fifth of what youve done. And its a disgrace. And honestly, you ought to be ashamed of yourself.",2016-10-09,Republican

You disagreed with FBI Director James Comey, calling your handling of classified information, quote, extremely careless. The FBI said that there were 110 classified e-mails that were exchanged, eight of which were top secret, and that it was possible hostile actors did gain access to those e-mails. You dont call that extremely careless?",2016-10-09,Moderator
Clinton,"Well, Martha, first, let me sayand Ive said before, but Ill repeat it, because I want everyone to hear itthat was a mistake, and I take responsibility for using a personal e-mail account. Obviously, if I were to do it over again, I would not. Im not making any excuses. It was a mistake. And I am very sorry about that. But I think its also important to point out where there are some misleading accusations from critics and others. After a year-long investigation, there is no evidence that anyone hacked the server I was using and there is no evidence that anyone can point to at allanyone who says otherwise has no basisthat any classified material ended up in the wrong hands. I take classified materials very seriously and always have. When I was on the Senate Armed Services Committee, I was privy to a lot of classified material. Obviously, as secretary of state, I had some of the most important secrets that we possess, such as going after Bin Laden. So I am very committed to taking classified information seriously.

She said the 33,000 e-mails had to do with her daughters wedding, number one, and a yoga class. Well, maybe well give three or three or four or five or something. 33,000 e-mails deleted, and now shes saying there wasnt anything wrong. And more importantly, that was after getting a subpoena. That wasnt before. That was after. She got it from the United States Congress. And Ill be honest, I am so disappointed in congressmen, including Republicans, for allowing this to happen. Our Justice Department, where her husband goes onto the back of an airplane for 39 minutes, talks to the attorney general days before a ruling is going to be made on her case. But for you to say that there was nothing wrong with you deleting 39,000 e-mails, again, you should be ashamed of yourself.

Cooper,Secretary Clinton?,2016-10-09,Moderator
Clinton,"Well, I think Donald was about to say hes going to solve it by repealing it and getting rid of the Affordable Care Act. And Im going to fix it, because I agree with you. Premiums have gotten too high. Copays, deductibles, prescription drug costs, and Ive laid out a series of actions that we can take to try to get those costs down. But heres what I dont want people to forget when were talking about reining in the costs, which has to be the highest priority of the next president, when the Affordable Care Act passed, it wasnt just that 20 million people got insurance who didnt have it before. But that in and of itself was a good thing. I meet these people all the time, and they tell me what a difference having that insurance meant to them and their families. But everybody else, the 170 million of us who get health insurance through our employers got big benefits. Number one, insurance companies cant deny you coverage because of a pre-existing condition. Number two, no lifetime limits, which is a big deal if you have serious health problems. Number three, women cant be charged more than men for our health insurance, which is the way it used to be before the Affordable Care Act. Number four, if youre under 26, and your parents have a policy, you can be on that policy until the age of 26, something that didnt happen before. So I want very much to save what works and is good about the Affordable Care Act. But weve got to get costs down. Weve got to provide some additional help to small businesses so that they can afford to provide health insurance. But if we repeal it, as Donald has proposed, and start over again, all of those benefits I just mentioned are lost to everybody, not just people who get their health insurance on the exchange. And then we would have to start all over again. Right now, we are at 90 percent health insurance coverage. Thats the highest weve ever been in our country.",2016-10-09,Democrat
Cooper,"Secretary Clinton, your time is up.",2016-10-09,Moderator
Clinton,"So I want us to get to 100 percent, but get costs down and keep quality up.",2016-10-09,Democrat
Cooper,"Mr. Trump, you have two minutes.",2016-10-09,Moderator
Trump,"It is such a great question and its maybe the question I get almost more than anything else, outside of defense. Obamacare is a disaster. You know it. We all know it. Its going up at numbers that nobodys ever seen worldwide. Nobodys ever seen numbers like this for health care. Its only getting worse. In 17, it implodes by itself. Their method of fixing it is to go back and ask Congress for more money, more and more money. We have right now almost $20 trillion in debt. Obamacare will never work. Its very bad, very bad health insurance. Far too expensive. And not only expensive for the person that has it, unbelievably expensive for our country. Its going to be one of the biggest line items very shortly. We have to repeal it and replace it with something absolutely much less expensive and something that works, where your plan can actually be tailored. We have to get rid of the lines around the state, artificial lines, where we stop insurance companies from coming in and competing, because they wantand President Obama and whoever was working on itthey want to leave those lines, because that gives the insurance companies essentially monopolies. We want competition. You will have the finest health care plan there is. She wants to go to a single-payer plan, which would be a disaster, somewhat similar to Canada. And if you havent noticed the Canadians, when they need a big operation, when something happens, they come into the United States in many cases because their system is so slow. Its catastrophic in certain ways. But she wants to go to single payer, which means the government basically rules everything. Hillary Clinton has been after this for years. Obamacare was the first step. Obamacare is a total disaster. And not only are your rates going up by numbers that nobodys ever believed, but your deductibles are going up, so that unless you get hit by a truck, youre never going to be able to use it.",2016-10-09,Republican

Your husband called Obamacare, quote, the craziest thing in the world, saying that small-business owners are getting killed as premiums double, coverage is cut in half. Was he mistaken or was the mistake simply telling the truth?",2016-10-09,Moderator
Clinton,"No, I mean, he clarified what he meant. And its very clear. Look, we are in a situation in our country where if we were to start all over again, we might come up with a different system. But we have an employer-based system. Thats where the vast majority of people get their health care. And the Affordable Care Act was meant to try to fill the gap between people who were too poor and couldnt put together any resources to afford health care, namely people on Medicaid. Obviously, Medicare, which is a single-payer system, which takes care of our elderly and does a great job doing it, by the way, and then all of the people who were employed, but people who were working but didnt have the money to afford insurance and didnt have anybody, an employer or anybody else, to help them.",2016-10-09,Democrat

I mean, whether we like it or not, and we could be very politically correct, but whether we like it or not, there is a problem. And we have to be sure that Muslims come in and report when they see something going on. When they see hatred going on, they have to report it. As an example, in San Bernardino, many people saw the bombs all over the apartment of the two people that killed 14 and wounded many, many people. Horribly wounded. Theyll never be the same. Muslims have to report the problems when they see them. And, you know, theres always a reason for everything. If they dont do that, its a very difficult situation for our country, because you look at Orlando and you look at San Bernardino and you look at the World Trade Center. Go outside. Look at Paris. Look at that horriblethese are radical Islamic terrorists. And she wont even mention the word and nor will President Obama. He wont use the term radical Islamic terrorism. Now, to solve a problem, you have to be able to state what the problem is or at least say the name. She wont say the name and President Obama wont say the name. But the name is there. Its radical Islamic terror. And before you solve it, you have to say the name.",2016-10-09,Republican
Raddatz,Secretary Clinton?,2016-10-09,Moderator
Clinton,"Well, thank you for asking your question. And Ive heard this question from a lot of Muslim-Americans across our country, because, unfortunately, theres been a lot of very divisive, dark things said about Muslims. And even someone like Captain Khan, the young man who sacrificed himself defending our country in the United States Army, has been subject to attack by Donald. I want to say just a couple of things. First, weve had Muslims in America since George Washington. And weve had many successful Muslims. We just lost a particularly well-known one with Muhammad Ali. My vision of America is an America where everyone has a place, if youre willing to work hard, you do your part, you contribute to the community. Thats what America is. Thats what we want America to be for our children and our grandchildren. Its also very short-sighted and even dangerous to be engaging in the kind of demagogic rhetoric that Donald has about Muslims. We need American Muslims to be part of our eyes and ears on our front lines. Ive worked with a lot of different Muslim groups around America. Ive met with a lot of them, and Ive heard how important it is for them to feel that they are wanted and included and part of our country, part of our homeland security, and thats what I want to see. Its also important I intend to defeat ISIS, to do so in a coalition with majority Muslim nations. Right now, a lot of those nations are hearing what Donald says and wondering, why should we cooperate with the Americans? And this is a gift to ISIS and the terrorists, violent jihadist terrorists. We are not at war with Islam. And it is a mistake and it plays into the hands of the terrorists to act as though we are. So I want a country where citizens like you and your family are just as welcome as anyone else.",2016-10-09,Democrat
Raddatz,"Thank you, Secretary Clinton.",2016-10-09,Moderator
Trump,"First of all, Captain Khan is an American hero, and if I were president at that time, he would be alive today, because unlike her, who voted for the war without knowing what she was doing, I would not have had our people in Iraq. Iraq was a disaster. So he would have been alive today. The Muslim ban is something that in some form has morphed into a extreme vetting from certain areas of the world. Hillary Clinton wants to allow hundreds of thousandsexcuse me. Excuse me..",2016-10-09,Republican

Trump,Why dont you interrupt her?,2016-10-09,Republican
Raddatz,Would you please explain whether or not the Muslim ban still stands?,2016-10-09,Moderator
Trump,"Its called extreme vetting. We are going to areas like Syria where theyre coming in by the tens of thousands because of Barack Obama. And Hillary Clinton wants to allow a 550 percent increase over Obama. People are coming into our country like we have no idea who they are, where they are from, what their feelings about our country is, and she wants 550 percent more. This is going to be the great Trojan horse of all time. We have enough problems in this country. I believe in building safe zones. I believe in having other people pay for them, as an example, the Gulf states, who are not carrying their weight, but they have nothing but money, and take care of people. But I dont want to have, with all the problems this country has and all of the problems that you see going on, hundreds of thousands of people coming in from Syria when we know nothing about them. We know nothing about their values and we know nothing about their love for our country.",2016-10-09,Republican
Raddatz,"And, Secretary Clinton, let me ask you about that, because you have asked for an increase from 10,000 to 65,000 Syrian refugees. We know you want tougher vetting. Thats not a perfect system. So why take the risk of having those refugees come into the country?",2016-10-09,Moderator
Clinton,"Well, first of all, I will not let anyone into our country that I think poses a risk to us. But there are a lot of refugees, women and childrenthink of that picture we all saw of that 4-year-old boy with the blood on his forehead because hed been bombed by the Russian and Syrian air forces. There are children suffering in this catastrophic war, largely, I believe, because of Russian aggression. And we need to do our part. We by no means are carrying anywhere near the load that Europe and others are. But we will have vetting that is as tough as it needs to be from our professionals, our intelligence experts and others. So I thought that what he said was extremely unwise and even dangerous. And indeed, you can look at the propaganda on a lot of the terrorist sites, and what Donald Trump says about Muslims is used to recruit fighters, because they want to create a war between us. And the final thing I would say, this is the 10th or 12th time that hes denied being for the war in Iraq. We have it on tape. The entire press corps has looked at it. Its been debunked, but it never stops him from saying whatever he wants to say.",2016-10-09,Democrat

In some cases, theyre murderers, drug lords, drug problems. And they dont want them. And Hillary Clinton, when she was secretary of state, said thats OK, we cant force it into their country. Let me tell you, Im going to force them right back into their country. Theyre murderers and some very bad people. And I will tell you very strongly, when Bernie Sanders said she had bad judgment, she has really bad judgment, because we are letting people into this country that are going to cause problems and crime like youve never seen. Were also letting drugs pour through our southern border at a record clip. At a record clip. And it shouldnt be allowed to happen. ICE just endorsed me. Theyve never endorsed a presidential candidate. The Border Patrol agents, 16,500, just recently endorsed me, and they endorsed me because I understand the border. She doesnt. She wants amnesty for everybody. Come right in. Come right over. Its a horrible thing shes doing. Shes got bad judgment, and honestly, so bad that she should never be president of the United States. That I can tell you.",2016-10-09,Republican

This question involves WikiLeaks release of purported excerpts of Secretary Clintons paid speeches, which she has refused to release, and one line in particular, in which you, Secretary Clinton, purportedly say you need both a public and private position on certain issues. So, Tu, from Virginia asks, is it OK for politicians to be two-faced? Is it acceptable for a politician to have a private stance on issues? Secretary Clinton, your two minutes.",2016-10-09,Moderator
Clinton,"Well, right. As I recall, that was something I said about Abraham Lincoln after having seen the wonderful Steven Spielberg movie called Lincoln. It was a master class watching President Lincoln get the Congress to approve the 13th Amendment. It was principled, and it was strategic. And I was making the point that it is hard sometimes to get the Congress to do what you want to do and you have to keep working at it. And, yes, President Lincoln was trying to convince some people, he used some arguments, convincing other people, he used other arguments. That was a greatI thought a great display of presidential leadership. But, you know, lets talk about whats really going on here, Martha, because our intelligence community just came out and said in the last few days that the Kremlin, meaning Putin and the Russian government, are directing the attacks, the hacking on American accounts to influence our election. And WikiLeaks is part of that, as are other sites where the Russians hack information, we dont even know if its accurate information, and then they put it out. We have never in the history of our country been in a situation where an adversary, a foreign power, is working so hard to influence the outcome of the election. And believe me, theyre not doing it to get me elected. Theyre doing it to try to influence the election for Donald Trump.",2016-10-09,Democrat

Trump,"Well, I think I should respond, becauseso ridiculous. Look, now shes blamingshe got caught in a total lie. Her papers went out to all her friends at the banks, Goldman Sachs and everybody else, and she said thingsWikiLeaks that just came out. And she lied. Now shes blaming the lie on the late, great Abraham Lincoln. Thats one that I havent[laughter] OK, Honest Abe, Honest Abe never lied. Thats the good thing. Thats the big difference between Abraham Lincoln and you. Thats a big, big difference. Were talking about some difference. But as far as other elements of what she was saying, I dont know Putin. I think it would be great if we got along with Russia because we could fight ISIS together, as an example. But I dont know Putin. But I notice, anytime anything wrong happens, they like to say the Russians areshe doesnt know if its the Russians doing the hacking. Maybe there is no hacking. But they always blame Russia. And the reason they blame Russia because they think theyre trying to tarnish me with Russia. I know nothing about Russia. I knowI know about Russia, but I know nothing about the inner workings of Russia. I dont deal there. I have no businesses there. I have no loans from Russia. I have a very, very great balance sheet, so great that when I did the Old Post Office on Pennsylvania Avenue, the United States government, because of my balance sheet, which they actually know very well, chose me to do the Old Post Office, between the White House and Congress, chose me to do the Old Post Office. One of the primary things, in fact, perhaps the primary thing was balance sheet. But I have no loans with Russia. You could go to the United States government, and they would probably tell you that, because they know my sheet very well in order to get that development I had to have. Now, the taxes are a very simple thing. As soon as I havefirst of all, I pay hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes. Many of her friends took bigger deductions. Warren Buffett took a massive deduction. Soros, whos a friend of hers, took a massive deduction. Many of the people that are giving her all this money that she can do many more commercials than me gave hertook massive deductions. I pay hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes. Butbut as soon as my routine audit is finished, Ill release my returns. Ill be very proud to. Theyre actually quite great.",2016-10-09,Republican

Cooper,"Mr. Trump, you have two minutes.",2016-10-09,Moderator
Trump,"Well, one thing Id do is get rid of carried interest. One of the greatest provisions for people like me, to be honest with you, I give up a lot when I run, because I knock out the tax code. And she could have done this years ago, by the way. Shes a United Statesshe was a United States senator. She complains that Donald Trump took advantage of the tax code. Well, why didnt she change it? Why didnt you change it when you were a senator? The reason you didnt is that all your friends take the same advantage that I do. And I do. You have provisions in the tax code that, frankly, we could change. But you wouldnt change it, because all of these people give you the money so you can take negative ads on Donald Trump. Butand I say that about a lot of things. You know, Ive heard Hillary complaining about so many different things over the years. I wish you would have done this. But shes been there for 30 years shes been doing this stuff. She never changed. And she never will change. She never will change. Were getting rid of carried interest provisions. Im lowering taxes actually, because I think its so important for corporations, because we have corporations leavingmassive corporations and little ones, little ones cant form. Were getting rid of regulations which goes hand in hand with the lowering of the taxes. But were bringing the tax rate down from 35 percent to 15 percent. Were cutting taxes for the middle class. And I will tell you, we are cutting them big league for the middle class. And I will tell you, Hillary Clinton is raising your taxes, folks. You can look at me. Shes raising your taxes really high. And what thats going to do is a disaster for the country. But she is raising your taxes and Im lowering your taxes. That in itself is a big difference. We are going to be thriving again. We have no growth in this country. Theres no growth. If China has a GDP of 7 percent, its like a national catastrophe. Were down at 1 percent. And thats, like, no growth. And were going lower, in my opinion. And a lot of it has to do with the fact that our taxes are so high, just about the highest in the world. And Im bringing them down to one of the lower in the world. And I think its so importantone of the most important things we can do. But she is raising everybodys taxes massively.",2016-10-09,Republican
Cooper,"Secretary Clinton, you have two minutes. The question was, what specific tax provisions will you change to ensure the wealthiest Americans pay their fair share of taxes?",2016-10-09,Moderator
Clinton,"Well, everything youve heard just now from Donald is not true. Im sorry I have to keep saying this, but he lives in an alternative reality. And it is sort of amusing to hear somebody who hasnt paid federal income taxes in maybe 20 years talking about what hes going to do. But Ill tell you what hes going to do. His plan will give the wealthy and corporations the biggest tax cuts theyve ever had, more than the Bush tax cuts by at least a factor of two. Donald always takes care of Donald and people like Donald, and this would be a massive gift. And, indeed, the way that he talks about his tax cuts would end up raising taxes on middle-class families, millions of middle-class families. Now, heres what I want to do. I have said nobody who makes less than $250,000 a yearand thats the vast majority of Americans as you knowwill have their taxes raised, because I think weve got to go where the money is. And the money is with people who have taken advantage of every single break in the tax code. And, yes, when I was a senator, I did vote to close corporate loopholes. I voted to close, I think, one of the loopholes he took advantage of when he claimed a billion-dollar loss that enabled him to avoid paying taxes. I want to have a tax on people who are making a million dollars. Its called the Buffett rule. Yes, Warren Buffett is the one whos gone out and said somebody like him should not be paying a lower tax rate than his secretary. I want to have a surcharge on incomes above $5 million. We have to make up for lost times, because I want to invest in you. I want to invest in hard-working families. And I think its been unfortunate, but its happened, that since the Great Recession, the gains have all gone to the top. And we need to reverse that. People like Donald, who paid zero in taxes, zero for our vets, zero for our military, zero for health and education, that is wrong.",2016-10-09,Democrat

In the last month, taxes were the number-one issue on Facebook for the first time in the campaign. The New York Times published three pages of your 1995 tax returns. They show you claimed a $916 million loss, which means you could have avoided paying personal federal income taxes for years. Youve said you pay state taxes, employee taxes, real estate taxes, property taxes. You have not answered, though, a simple question. Did you use that $916 million loss to avoid paying personal federal income taxes for years?",2016-10-09,Moderator

Trump,"A lot of myexcuse me, Andersona lot of my write- off was depreciation and other things that Hillary as a senator allowed. And shell always allow it, because the people that give her all this money, they want it. Thats why. See, I understand the tax code better than anybody thats ever run for president. Hillary Clintonand its extremely complexHillary Clinton has friends that want all of these provisions, including they want the carried interest provision, which is very important to Wall Street people. But they really want the carried interest provision, which I believe Hillarys leaving. Very interesting why shes leaving carried interest. But I will tell you that, number one, I pay tremendous numbers of taxes. I absolutely used it. And so did Warren Buffett and so did George Soros and so did many of the other people that Hillary is getting money from. Now, I wont mention their names, because theyre rich, but theyre not famous. So we wont make them famous.",2016-10-09,Republican

Hey, if she had a problemfor 30 years shes been doing this, Anderson. I say it all the time. She talks about health care. Why didnt she do something about it? She talks about taxes.

Clinton,"You know, under our Constitution, presidents have something called veto power. Look, he has now said repeatedly, 30 years this and 30 years that. So let me talk about my 30 years in public service. Im very glad to do so. Eight million kids every year have health insurance, because when I was first lady I worked with Democrats and Republicans to create the Childrens Health Insurance Program. Hundreds of thousands of kids now have a chance to be adopted because I worked to change our adoption and foster care system. After 9/11, I went to work with Republican mayor, governor and president to rebuild New York and to get health care for our first responders who were suffering because they had run toward danger and gotten sickened by it. Hundreds of thousands of National Guard and Reserve members have health care because of work that I did, and children have safer medicines because I was able to pass a law that required the dosing to be more carefully done. When I was secretary of state, I went around the world advocating for our country, but also advocating for womens rights, to make sure that women had a decent chance to have a better life and negotiated a treaty with Russia to lower nuclear weapons. Four hundred pieces of legislation have my name on it as a sponsor or cosponsor when I was a senator for eight years. I worked very hard and was very proud to be re-elected in New York by an even bigger margin than I had been elected the first time. And as president, I will take that work, that bipartisan work, that finding common ground, because you have to be able to get along with people to get things done in Washington.",2016-10-09,Democrat

Raddatz,"Mr. Trump, were going to move on. The heart-breaking video of a 5-year-old Syrian boy named Omran sitting in an ambulance after being pulled from the rubble after an air strike in Aleppo focused the worlds attention on the horrors of the war in Syria, with 136 million views on Facebook alone. But there are much worse images coming out of Aleppo every day now, where in the past few weeks alone, 400 people have been killed, at least 100 of them children. Just days ago, the State Department called for a war crimes investigation of the Syrian regime of Bashar al-Assad and its ally, Russia, for their bombardment of Aleppo. So this next question comes from social media through Facebook. Diane from Pennsylvania asks, if you were president, what would you do about Syria and the humanitarian crisis in Aleppo? Isnt it a lot like the Holocaust when the U.S. waited too long before we helped? Secretary Clinton, we will begin with your two minutes.",2016-10-09,Moderator
Clinton,"Well, the situation in Syria is catastrophic. And every day that goes by, we see the results of the regime by Assad in partnership with the Iranians on the ground, the Russians in the air, bombarding places, in particular Aleppo, where there are hundreds of thousands of people, probably about 250,000 still left. And there is a determined effort by the Russian air force to destroy Aleppo in order to eliminate the last of the Syrian rebels who are really holding out against the Assad regime. Russia hasnt paid any attention to ISIS. Theyre interested in keeping Assad in power. So I, when I was secretary of state, advocated and I advocate today a no-fly zone and safe zones. We need some leverage with the Russians, because they are not going to come to the negotiating table for a diplomatic resolution, unless there is some leverage over them. And we have to work more closely with our partners and allies on the ground. But I want to emphasize that what is at stake here is the ambitions and the aggressiveness of Russia. Russia has decided that its all in, in Syria. And theyve also decided who they want to see become president of the United States, too, and its not me. Ive stood up to Russia. Ive taken on Putin and others, and I would do that as president. I think wherever we can cooperate with Russia, thats fine. And I did as secretary of state. Thats how we got a treaty reducing nuclear weapons. Its how we got the sanctions on Iran that put a lid on the Iranian nuclear program without firing a single shot. So I would go to the negotiating table with more leverage than we have now. But I do support the effort to investigate for crimes, war crimes committed by the Syrians and the Russians and try to hold them accountable.",2016-10-09,Democrat

Trump,"You were in total contact with the White House, and perhaps, sadly, Obama probably still listened to you. I dont think he would be listening to you very much anymore. Obama draws the line in the sand. It was laughed at all over the world what happened. Now, with that being said, she talks tough against Russia. But our nuclear program has fallen way behind, and theyve gone wild with their nuclear program. Not good. Our government shouldnt have allowed that to happen. Russia is new in terms of nuclear. We are old. Were tired. Were exhausted in terms of nuclear. A very bad thing. Now, she talks tough, she talks really tough against Putin and against Assad. She talks in favor of the rebels. She doesnt even know who the rebels are. You know, every time we take rebels, whether its in Iraq or anywhere else, were arming people. And you know what happens? They end up being worse than the people. Look at what she did in Libya with Gadhafi. Gadhafis out. Its a mess. And, by the way, ISIS has a good chunk of their oil. Im sure you probably have heard that. It was a disaster. Because the fact is, almost everything shes done in foreign policy has been a mistake and its been a disaster. But if you look at Russia, just take a look at Russia, and look at what they did this week, where I agree, she wasnt there, but possibly shes consulted. We sign a peace treaty. Everyones all excited. Well, what Russia did with Assad and, by the way, with Iran, who you made very powerful with the dumbest deal perhaps Ive ever seen in the history of deal-making, the Iran deal, with the $150 billion, with the $1.7 billion in cash, which is enough cash to fill up this room.",2016-10-09,Republican

I would specifically target Baghdadi, because I think our targeting of Al Qaida leadersand I was involved in a lot of those operations, highly classified onesmade a difference. So I think that could help. I would also consider arming the Kurds. The Kurds have been our best partners in Syria, as well as Iraq.

Because NAFTA, signed by her husband, is perhaps the greatest disaster trade deal in the history of the world. Not in this country. It stripped us of manufacturing jobs. We lost our jobs. We lost our money. We lost our plants. It is a disaster. And now she wants to sign TPP, even though she says now shes for it. She called it the gold standard. And by the way, at the last debate, she lied, because it turned out that she did say the gold standard and she said she didnt say it. They actually said that she lied. OK? And she lied. But shes lied about a lot of things. I would be a president for all of the people, African-Americans, the inner cities. Devastating whats happening to our inner cities. Shes been talking about it for years. As usual, she talks about it, nothing happens. She doesnt get it done. Same with the Latino Americans, the Hispanic Americans. The same exact thing. They talk, they dont get it done. You go into the inner cities andyou see its 45 percent poverty. African- Americans now 45 percent poverty in the inner cities. The education is a disaster. Jobs are essentially nonexistent. I mean, itsyou know, and Ive been saying at big speeches where I have 20,000 and 30,000 people, what do you have to lose? It cant get any worse. And shes been talking about the inner cities for 25 years. Nothings going to ever happen. Let me tell you, if shes president of the United States, nothings going to happen. Its just going to be talk.

Its with him and with the hateful and divisive campaign that he has run, and the inciting of violence at his rallies, and the very brutal kinds of comments about not just women, but all Americans, all kinds of Americans. And what he has said about African-Americans and Latinos, about Muslims, about POWs, about immigrants, about people with disabilities, hes never apologized for. And so I do think that a lot of the tone and tenor that he has saidIm proud of the campaign that Bernie Sanders and I ran. We ran a campaign based on issues, not insults. And he is supporting me 100 percent.",2016-10-09,Democrat

You look at the violence thats taking place in the inner cities, Chicago, you take a look at Washington, D.C. We have a increase in murder within our cities, the biggest in 45 years. We have a divided nation, because people like herand believe me, she has tremendous hate in her heart. And when she said deplorables, she meant it. And when she said irredeemable, theyre irredeemable, you didnt mention that, but when she said theyre irredeemable, to me that might have been even worse.",2016-10-09,Republican

Cooper,"Mr. Trump, let me follow up with you. In 2008, you wrote in one of your books that the most important characteristic of a good leader is discipline. You said, if a leader doesnt have it, quote, he or she wont be one for very long. In the days after the first debate, you sent out a series of tweets from 3 a.m. to 5 a.m., including one that told people to check out a sex tape. Is that the discipline of a good leader?",2016-10-09,Moderator
Trump,"No, there wasnt check out a sex tape. It was just take a look at the person that she built up to be this wonderful Girl Scout who was no Girl Scout.",2016-10-09,Republican

Cooper,"The question is, is that the discipline of a good leader?",2016-10-09,Moderator
Trump," 600wait a minute, Anderson, 600 times. Well, she said she was awake at 3 oclock in the morning, and she also sent a tweet out at 3 oclock in the morning, but I wont even mention that. But she said shell be awake. Whos goingthe famous thing, were going to answer our call at 3 oclock in the morning. Guess what happened? Ambassador StevensAmbassador Stevens sent 600 requests for help. And the only one she talked to was Sidney Blumenthal, whos her friend and not a good guy, by the way. So, you know, she shouldnt be talking about that. Now, tweeting happens to be a modern day form of communication. I mean, you can like it or not like it. I have, between Facebook and Twitter, I have almost 25 million people. Its a very effective way of communication. So you can put it down, but it is a very effective form of communication. Im not un-proud of it, to be honest with you.",2016-10-09,Republican

Trump,Im shocked to hear that. [laughter],2016-10-09,Republican
Clinton,"Well, its not only my opinion. Its the opinion of many others, national security experts, Republicans, former Republican members of Congress. But its in part because those of us who have had the great privilege of seeing this job up close and know how difficult it is, and its not just because I watched my husband take a $300 billion deficit and turn it into a $200 billion surplus, and 23 million new jobs were created, and incomes went up for everybody. Everybody. African-American incomes went up 33 percent. And its not just because I worked with George W. Bush after 9/11, and I was very proud that when I told him what the city needed, what we needed to recover, he said youve got it, and he never wavered. He stuck with me. And I have worked and I admire President Obama. He inherited the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. That was a terrible time for our country.",2016-10-09,Democrat

Raddatz,"We begin with your two minutes, Secretary Clinton.",2016-10-09,Moderator
Clinton,"Thank you. Well, youre right. This is one of the most important issues in this election. I want to appoint Supreme Court justices who understand the way the world really works, who have real-life experience, who have not just been in a big law firm and maybe clerked for a judge and then gotten on the bench, but, you know, maybe they tried some more cases, they actually understand what people are up against. Because I think the current court has gone in the wrong direction. And so I would want to see the Supreme Court reverse Citizens United and get dark, unaccountable money out of our politics. Donald doesnt agree with that. I would like the Supreme Court to understand that voting rights are still a big problem in many parts of our country, that we dont always do everything we can to make it possible for people of color and older people and young people to be able to exercise their franchise. I want a Supreme Court that will stick with Roe v. Wade and a womans right to choose, and I want a Supreme Court that will stick with marriage equality. Now, Donald has put forth the names of some people that he would consider. And among the ones that he has suggested are people who would reverse Roe v. Wade and reverse marriage equality. I think that would be a terrible mistake and would take us backwards. I want a Supreme Court that doesnt always side with corporate interests. I want a Supreme Court that understands because youre wealthy and you can give more money to something doesnt mean you have any more rights or should have any more rights than anybody else. So I have very clear views about what I want to see to kind of change the balance on the Supreme Court. And I regret deeply that the Senate has not done its job and they have not permitted a vote on the person that President Obama, a highly qualified person, theyve not given him a vote to be able to be have the full complement of nine Supreme Court justices. I think that was a dereliction of duty. I hope that they will see their way to doing it, but if I am so fortunate enough as to be president, I will immediately move to make sure that we fill that, we have nine justices that get to work on behalf of our people.",2016-10-09,Democrat

Trump,"Justice Scalia, great judge, died recently. And we have a vacancy. I am looking to appoint judges very much in the mold of Justice Scalia. Im looking for judgesand Ive actually picked 20 of them so that people would see, highly respected, highly thought of, and actually very beautifully reviewed by just about everybody. But people that will respect the Constitution of the United States. And I think that this is so important. Also, the Second Amendment, which is totally under siege by people like Hillary Clinton. Theyll respect the Second Amendment and what it stands for, what it represents. So important to me. Now, Hillary mentioned something about contributions just so you understand. So I will have in my race more than $100 million put inof my money, meaning Im not taking all of this big money from all of these different corporations like shes doing. What I ask is this. So Im putting in more thanby the time its finished, Ill have more than $100 million invested. Pretty much self-funding mine. Were raising money for the Republican Party, and were doing tremendously on the small donations, $61 average or so. Its $30 million less for special interests that will tell you exactly what to do and it would really, I think, be a nice sign to the American public. Why arent you putting some money in? You have a lot of it. Youve made a lot of it because of the fact that youve been in office. Made a lot of it while you were secretary of state, actually. So why arent you putting money into your own campaign? Im just curious.",2016-10-09,Republican

Cooper,We have one more question from Ken Bone about energy policy. Ken?,2016-10-09,Moderator
Cooper,"Mr. Trump, two minutes?",2016-10-09,Moderator
Trump,"Absolutely. I think its such a great question, because energy is under siege by the Obama administration. Under absolutely siege. The EPA, Environmental Protection Agency, is killing these energy companies. And foreign companies are now coming in buying ourbuying so many of our different plants and then re-jiggering the plant so that they can take care of their oil. We are killingabsolutely killing our energy business in this country. Now, Im all for alternative forms of energy, including wind, including solar, et cetera. But we need much more than wind and solar. And you look at our miners. Hillary Clinton wants to put all the miners out of business. There is a thing called clean coal. Coal will last for 1,000 years in this country. Now we have natural gas and so many other things because of technology. We have unbelievablewe have found over the last seven years, we have found tremendous wealth right under our feet. So good. Especially when you have $20 trillion in debt. I will bring our energy companies back. Theyll be able to compete. Theyll make money. Theyll pay off our national debt. Theyll pay off our tremendous budget deficits, which are tremendous. But we are putting our energy companies out of business. We have to bring back our workers. You take a look at whats happening to steel and the cost of steel and China dumping vast amounts of steel all over the United States, which essentially is killing our steelworkers and our steel companies. We have to guard our energy companies. We have to make it possible. The EPA is so restrictive that they are putting our energy companies out of business. And all you have to do is go to a great place like West Virginia or places like Ohio, which is phenomenal, or places like Pennsylvania and you see what theyre doing to the people, miners and others in the energy business. Its a disgrace.",2016-10-09,Republican

Trump,Its an absolute disgrace.,2016-10-09,Republican
Cooper,"Secretary Clinton, two minutes.",2016-10-09,Moderator
Clinton,"And actuallywell, that was very interesting. First of all, China is illegally dumping steel in the United States and Donald Trump is buying it to build his buildings, putting steelworkers and American steel plants out of business. Thats something that I fought against as a senator and that I would have a trade prosecutor to make sure that we dont get taken advantage of by China on steel or anything else. You know, because it sounds like youre in the business or youre aware of people in the businessyou know that we are now for the first time ever energy-independent. We are not dependent upon the Middle East. But the Middle East still controls a lot of the prices. So the price of oil has been way down. And that has had a damaging effect on a lot of the oil companies, right? We are, however, producing a lot of natural gas, which serves as a bridge to more renewable fuels. And I think thats an important transition. Weve got to remain energy-independent. It gives us much more power and freedom than to be worried about what goes on in the Middle East. We have enough worries over there without having to worry about that. So I have a comprehensive energy policy, but it really does include fighting climate change, because I think that is a serious problem. And I support moving toward more clean, renewable energy as quickly as we can, because I think we can be the 21st century clean energy superpower and create millions of new jobs and businesses. But I also want to be sure that we dont leave people behind. Thats why Im the only candidate from the very beginning of this campaign who had a plan to help us revitalize coal country, because those coal miners and their fathers and their grandfathers, they dug that coal out. A lot of them lost their lives. They were injured, but they turned the lights on and they powered our factories. I dont want to walk away from them. So weve got to do something for them.",2016-10-09,Democrat

Raddatz,"Mr. Trump, would you like to go first?",2016-10-09,Moderator
Clinton,"Well, I certainly will, because I think thats a very fair and important question. Look, I respect his children. His children are incredibly able and devoted, and I think that says a lot about Donald. I dont agree with nearly anything else he says or does, but I do respect that. And I think that is something that as a mother and a grandmother is very important to me. So I believe that this election has become in part soso conflict-oriented, so intense because theres a lot at stake. This is not an ordinary time, and this is not an ordinary election. We are going to be choosing a president who will set policy for not just four or eight years, but because of some of the important decisions we have to make here at home and around the world, from the Supreme Court to energy and so much else, and so there is a lot at stake. Its one of the most consequential elections that weve had. And thats why Ive tried to put forth specific policies and plans, trying to get it off of the personal and put it on to what it is I want to do as president. And thats why I hope people will check on that for themselves so that they can see that, yes, Ive spent 30 years, actually maybe a little more, working to help kids and families.

Lehrer,"Good evening from the Bushnell Theatre in Hartford, Connecticut. Im Jim Lehrer of the News Hour on PBS. Welcome to the first of the 1996 Presidential debates between President Bill Clinton, the Democratic nominee, and Senator Bob Dole, the Republican nominee. This event is sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates. It will last 90 minutes following a format and rules worked out by the two campaigns. There will be two-minute opening and closing statements. In between, a series of questions, each having three parts. A 90-second answer, a 60-second rebuttal, and a 30-second response. I will assist the candidates in adhering to those time limits with the help of a series of lights visible to both. Under their rules, the candidates are not allowed to question each other directly. I will ask the questions. There are no limitations on the subjects. The order for everything tonight was determined by coin toss. Now, to the opening statements and to President Clinton. Mr. President.",1996-10-06,Moderator
Clinton,"Thank you, Jim. And thank you to the people of Hartford, our hosts. I want to begin by saying again how much I respect Senator Dole and his record of public service and how hard I will try to make this campaign and this debate one of ideas, not insults. Four years ago I ran for president at a time of high unemployment and rising frustration. I wanted to turn this country around with a program of opportunity for all, responsibility from all, and an American community where everybody has a role to play. I wanted a government that was smaller and less bureaucratic to help people make the most of their own lives. Four years ago you took me on faith. Now theres a record: Ten and a half million more jobs, rising incomes, falling crime rates and welfare rolls, a strong America at peace. We are better off than we were four years ago. Lets keep it going. We cut the deficit by 60 percent. Now, lets balance the budget and protect Medicare, Medicaid, education and the environment. We cut taxes for 15 million working Americans. Now lets pass the tax cuts for education and child rearing, help with medical emergencies, and buying a home. We passed family and medical leave. Now lets expand it so more people can succeed as parents and in the work force. We passed 100,000 police, the assault weapons ban, the Brady Bill. Now lets keep going by finishing the work of putting the police on the street and tackling juvenile gangs. We passed welfare reform. Now lets move a million people from welfare to work. And most important, lets make education our highest priority so that every eight-year-old will be able to read, every 12-year-old can log onto the Internet, every 18-year-old can go to college. We can build that bridge to the 21st Century. And I look forward to discussing exactly how were going to do it.",1996-10-06,Democrat
Lehrer,"Senator Dole, two minutes.",1996-10-06,Moderator
Dole,"Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President, for those kind words. Thank the people of Hartford, the Commission, and all those out here who may be listening or watching. Its a great honor for me to be here standing here as the Republican nominee. Im very proud to be the Republican nominee reaching out to Democrats and Independents. I have three very special people with me tonight: My wife, Elizabeth; my daughter, Robin, who has never let me down, and a fellow named Frank Carafa from New York, along with Ollie Manninen who helped me out in the mountains of Italy a few years back. Ive learned from them that people do have tough times. And sometimes you cant go it alone. And thats what America is all about. I remember getting my future back from doctors and nurses and a doctor in Chicago named Dr. Kalikian . And ever since that time, Ive tried to give something back to my country, to the people who are watching us tonight. America is the greatest place on the face of the earth. Now, I know millions of you still have anxieties. You work harder and harder to make ends meet and put food on the table. You worry about the quality and the safety of your children, and the quality of education. But even more importantly, you worry about the future and will they have the same opportunities that you and I have had. And Jack Kemp and I want to share with you some ideas tonight. Jack Kemp is my running mate, doing an outstanding job. Now, Im a plain-speaking man and I learned long ago that your word was your bond. And I promise you tonight that Ill try to address your concerns and not try to exploit them. Its a tall order, but Ive been running against the odds for a long time and, again, Im honored to be here this evening.",1996-10-06,Republican
Lehrer,"Mr. President, first question. There is a major difference in your view of the role of the Federal government and that of Senator Dole. How would you define the difference?",1996-10-06,Moderator
Clinton,"Well, Jim, I believe that the Federal government should give people the tools and try to establish the conditions in which they can make the most of their own lives. That, to me, is the key. And that leads me to some different conclusions from Senator Dole. For example, we have reduced the size of the Federal government to its smallest size in 30 years. We reduced more regulations, eliminated more programs than my two Republican predecessors. But I have worked hard for things like the Family and Medical Leave Law, the Brady Bill, the assault weapons ban, the program to put 100,000 police on the street. All of these are programs that Senator Dole opposed that I supported, because I felt they were a legitimate effort to help people make the most of their own lives. Ive worked hard to help families impart values to their own children. I supported the V-chip so that parents would be able to control what their kids watch on television when theyre young, along with the ratings systems for television and educational television. I supported strong action against the tobacco companies to stop the marketing, advertising, and sale of tobacco to young people. I supported a big increase in the safe and drug-free schools program. These were areas on which Senator Dole and I differed, but I believed they were the right areas for America to be acting together as one country to help individuals and families make the most of their own lives and raise their kids with good values and a good future.",1996-10-06,Democrat
Lehrer,"Senator Dole, one minute.",1996-10-06,Moderator
Dole,"I think the basic difference is, and I have had some experience in this, I think the basic difference, I trust the people. The President trusts the government. We go back and look at the healthcare plan that he wanted to impose on the American people. One seventh the total economy, 17 new taxes, price controls, 35 to 50 new bureaucracies that cost $1.5 trillion. Dont forget that, that happened in 1993. A tax increase, a tax on everybody in America. Not just the rich. If you made 25,000 as the original proposal, you got your Social Security taxes increased. We had a BTU tax we turned into a $35 million gas tax, a $265 billion tax increase. I guess I rely more on the individual. I carry a little card in my pocket called the Tenth Amendment. Where possible, I want to give power back to the states and back to the people. Thats my difference with the President. Well have specific differences later. He noted a few, but there are others.",1996-10-06,Republican
Lehrer,"Mr. President, 30 seconds.",1996-10-06,Moderator
Clinton,"I trust the people. Weve done a lot to give the people more powers to make their own decisions over their own lives. But I do think we are right when we try to, for example, give mothers and newborns 48 hours before they can be kicked out of the hospital, ending these drive-by deliveries. I think we were right to pass the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill, which says you cant lose your health insurance just because you change jobs or because someone in your familys been sick. Our government is smaller and less bureaucratic and has given more authority to the states than its two predecessors under Republican presidents. But I do believe we have to help our people get ready to succeed in the 21st Century.",1996-10-06,Democrat
Lehrer,"Senator Dole, the President said in his opening statement we are better off today than we were four years ago. Do you agree?",1996-10-06,Moderator
Dole,"Well, hes better off than he was four years ago.",1996-10-06,Republican
Clinton,I agree with that. Thats right.,1996-10-06,Democrat
Dole,"And I may be better off four years from now, but I dont know. I looked at the slowest growth in the century. He inherited a growth of 4.7 4.8 percent, now its down to about 2.4 percent. Were going to pass a million bankruptcies this year for the first time in history. Weve got stagnant wages. In fact, womens wages have dropped 2.2 percent. Mens wages havent gone up, gone down. So we have stagnation. We have the highest foreign debt in history. And it seems to me that if you take a look, are you better off? Well, I guess some may be better off. Saddam Hussein is probably better off than he was four years ago. Renee Proval (ph) is probably better off than he was four years ago. But are the American people? Theyre working harder and higher and harder paying more taxes. For the first time in history, you pay about 40 percent of what you earn. More than you spend for food, clothing and shelter combined for taxes under this administration. So some may be better off. They talk about family income being up. Thats not true in Connecticut, family income is down. And its up in some cases because both parents are working. One works for the family, and one works to pay taxes for the government. Were going to give them tax cuts so they can spend more time with their children, maybe even take a vacation. Thats what America is all about.",1996-10-06,Republican
Lehrer,"One minute, Mr. President.",1996-10-06,Moderator
Clinton,"Well, let me say, first of all, in February Senator Dole acknowledged that the American economy was in the best shape its been in in 30 years. We have ten and a half million more jobs, a faster job growth rate than under any Republican administration since the 1920s. Wages are goings up for the first time in a decade. We have record numbers of new small businesses. We have the biggest drop in the number of people in poverty in 27 years. All groups of people are growing. We had the biggest drop in income inequality in 27 years in 1995. The average familys income has gone up over $1600 just since our economic plan passed. So I think its clear that were better off than we were four years ago. Now we need to focus on what do we need to do to be better off still. How can we help people as we are to get their retirements when they work for small businesses, to be able to afford health insurance, to be able to educate their children. Thats what I want to focus on. But we are clearly better off than we were four years ago, as Senator Dole acknowledged this year.",1996-10-06,Democrat
Lehrer,Senator Dole.,1996-10-06,Moderator
Dole,"I doubt that I acknowledged that this year. But in any event, I think we just look at the facts. We ask the people that are viewing tonight, are you better off than you were four years ago. Its not whether were better off, its whether theyre better off. Are you working harder to put food on the table, feed your children. Are your children getting a better education. Drug use has doubled the past 44 months all across America. Crime has gone down but its because the mayors like Rudy Giuliani where one third of the drop happened in one city, New York City. So, yes, some may be better off. But of the people listening tonight, the working families who will benefit from economic packages, theyll be better off when Bob Dole is president and Jack Kemp is vice president.",1996-10-06,Republican
Lehrer,"Mr. President, Senator Dole has come pretty close in the last few days to accusing you of lying about his position on Medicare reform. Have you done so?",1996-10-06,Moderator
Clinton,"Absolutely not. Lets look at the position. First of all, remember that in this campaign season, since Senator Doles been a candidate, he has bragged about the fact that he voted against Medicare in the beginning, in 1965, one of only 12 members. He said he did the right thing then, he knew it wouldnt work at the time. Thats what he said. Then his budget that he passed along with Speaker Gingrich cut Medicare $270 billion, more than was necessary to repair the Medicare trust fund. It would have charged seniors more for out-of-pocket costs as well as more in premiums because doctors could have charged them more. The American Medical, Hospital Association, the Nurses Association, the Catholic Hospital Association all said hundreds of hospitals could close and people would be hurt badly under the Dole-Gingrich Medicare plan that I vetoed. And now with this risky $550 billion tax scheme of Senator Doles, even his own friends, his campaign co-chair, Senator DAmato, says that they cant possibly pay for it without cutting Medicare more and cutting Social Security as well, according to him. Now, my balanced budget plan adds ten years to the life of the Medicare trust fund, ten years. And well have time to deal with the long-term problems of the baby boomers. But it was simply wrong to finance their last scheme to cut Medicare $270 billion to run the risk of it withering on the vine. We always had to reform it over the years, but we need somebody who believes it in to reform it.",1996-10-06,Democrat

Dole,"Well, I must say, I look back at the vote on Medicare in 1965, we had a program called Eldercare that also provided drugs and means tests to people who needed medical attention received it. I thought it was a good program. But Ive supported Medicare ever since. In fact, I used to go home, my mother would tell me, Bob, all Ive got is my Social Security and my Medicare, dont cut it. I wouldnt violate anything my mother said. In fact, we had a conversation about our mothers one day, a very poignant conversation in the White House. Im concerned about healthcare. Ive had the best healthcare from government hospitals, Army hospitals and I know its importance, but weve got to fix it. Its his trustees, the Presidents trustees, not mine, who says its going to go broke. He doesnt fix it for ten years. We ought to appoint a commission, just as we did in Social Security in 1983, when we rescued Social Security, and I was proud to be on that commission, along with Claude Pepper, the champion of senior citizens from Florida. And we can do it again, if we take politics out of it. Stop scaring the seniors, Mr. President. Youve already spent $45 million scaring seniors and tearing me apart. I think its time to have a truce.",1996-10-06,Republican

Clinton,"Well, let me say, first of all, Id be happy to have a commission deal with this and I appreciate what Senator Dole did on the 83 Social Security commission. But it wont be possible to do, if his tax scheme passes because even his own campaign co-chair, Senator DAmato, says hell have to cut Medicare even more than was cut in the bill that I vetoed. I vetoed that bill because it cut more Medicare and and basically ran the risk of breaking up the system. My balanced budget plan puts ten years on the Medicare. We ought to do that, then we can have a commission. But Senator Doles plans are not good for the country.",1996-10-06,Democrat
Lehrer,"Senator Dole, speaking of your tax plan, do you still think thats a good idea, the 15 percent across the board tax cut?",1996-10-06,Moderator

Clinton,I need it.,1996-10-06,Democrat
Dole,"Well, the people need it, thats the point. This is not a Wall Street tax cut. This is a family tax cut. This is a Main Street tax cut, 15 percent across  lets take a family making $30,000 a year, thats $1261. Now, maybe to some in this Bushnell Memorial that its not a lot of money, but people watching tonight with a couple of kids, a working family, thats four or five months of day care, maybe a personal computer; its may be three or four months of mortgage payments. This economic package is about families but its a six-point package. First of all, its a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution which President Clinton defeated. He twisted arms and got six Democrats to vote the other way, but we lost by one vote. Its balancing a budget by the year 2002. Its a tax cut, cutting capital gains 50 percent. So you can go out and create more jobs and more opportunities. Its a state tax relief. Its a $500 per child tax credit. Its about litigation reforms. Now that the President gets millions of dollars from the trial lawyers, he probably doesnt like this provision. In fact, when I fell off the podium in Chico, before I lit the ground, hit the ground I had call on my cell phone from a trial lawyer saying I think weve got a case here. And its also regulatory reform. Its a good package, Mr. President. Wed like to have your support.",1996-10-06,Republican
Lehrer,Mr. President.,1996-10-06,Moderator
Clinton,"Well, heres the problem with it: It sounds very good, but theres a reason that 500 economists, including seven Nobel prize winners and business periodicals like Business Week, and even Senator Doles friends, Senator Warren Rudman, former Republican senator from New Hampshire, says its not a practical program. Its a $550 billion tax scheme that will cause a big hole in the deficit which will raise interest rates and slow down the economy and cause people to pay more for home mortgages, car payments, credit card payments, college loans, and small business loans. Its not good to raise the deficit. We worked too hard to lower it. It will actually raise taxes on nine million people and, in addition to that, it will force bigger cuts in Medicare, Medicaid, education and the environment than the ones that he and Mr. Gingrich passed that I vetoed last year. So it sounds great, but our targeted tax cut for education, child rearing, healthcare and home buying, which is paid for in my balanced budget plan, something that he has not done, certified by the Congressional budget office, thats the right way to go.",1996-10-06,Democrat
Dole,"The President wants to increase spending 20 percent over the next six years. I want to increase spending 14 percent, thats how simple it is. I want the government to pinch pennies for a change instead of the American families. Were talking about six percentage points over six years, and with that money you give it back to the working people. You also provide opportunity scholarships so low income parents will have the same choice that others have in sending their children to better schools. It will work, and when it does work, Mr. President, I know youll congratulate me.",1996-10-06,Republican
Lehrer,"Mr. President, the Senator mentioned trial lawyers and campaign, that means campaign financing. How do you personally avoid being unduly influenced by people who give you money or give you services in your campaigns?",1996-10-06,Moderator
Clinton,"Well, I try to articulate my positions as clearly as possible, tell people what I stand for and let them decide whether theyre going to support me or not. The Senator mentioned the trial lawyers. In the case of the product liability bill, which they passed and I vetoed, I think thats what hes talking about, I actually wanted to sign that bill. And I told the people exactly what the Congress exactly what kind of bill I would sign. Now, a lot of the trial lawyers didnt want me to sign any bill at all, but I had thought we ought to do what we could to cut frivolous lawsuits, but they wouldnt make some of the changes that I thought should be made. Now, let me just give you an example. I had a person in the Oval Office who lost a child in a school bus accident where a drunk driver caused the accident directly, but there were problems with the school bus. The drunk driver had no money. Under the new bill, if I had signed it, a person like that could never have had any recovery. I thought that was wrong. So I gave four or five specific examples to the Congress and said, prove to me that these people could recover but were going to eliminate frivolous lawsuits, Ill sign the bill. But generally I believe that a president has to be willing to do what he thinks is right. Ive done a lot of things that were controversial. My economic plan, my trade position, Bosnia, Haiti, taking on the NRA for the first time, taking on the tobacco companies for the first time. Sometimes you just have to do that because you know its right for the country over the long run. Thats what Ive tried to do and thats what I will continue to do as president.",1996-10-06,Democrat
Lehrer,Senator Dole.,1996-10-06,Moderator
Dole,"How does he avoid conflict? Well, I dont know in the case of the trial lawyers. I look at the trial lawyers, and when youre a few million short, you run out to Hollywood and pick up two to four million and organized labor comes to Washington, D.C. and puts 35 million into the pot. Now, if these arent special interests, Ive got a lot to learn. I was there for a while before I left on June the 11th. The trial lawyers and I dont  you know, my wifes a lawyer. Were the only two lawyers in Washington that trust each other. But were lawyers, I like lawyers. I dont dislike trial lawyers. But it seemed to me theres got to be some end to the frivolous lawsuits and theres got to be some cap on punitive damage. Youre putting a lot of business people out of business. Small businessmen and businesswomen who paid 70 percent of your ninteen , your$265 billion tax increase, the largest tax increase in the history of America. I said that one day and Pat Moynihan, a Democrat, say, no, he said, in the history of the world. So I modified it, the largest tax increase in the history of the world. And it seems to me that there is a problem there, Mr. President. And I will address you as Mr. President. You didnt do that with Mr. with President Bush in 1992.",1996-10-06,Republican

Clinton,"Let me say, first of all, I signed a tort reform bill that dealt with civilian aviation a couple of years ago. I proved that I will sign reasonable tort reform. Secondly, Senator Dole had some pretty harsh comments about special interest money, but it wasnt me who opposed what we tried to do to save the lives of children who were subject to tobacco and then went to the tobacco growers and bragged about standing up for the Federal government when we tried to stop the advertising, marketing, and sales of tobacco to children. And it wasnt me that let the polluters actually come into the halls of Congress, into the rooms, and rewrite the environmental laws. Thats what Speaker Gingrich and Senator Dole did, not me.",1996-10-06,Democrat
Dole,Thats not true.,1996-10-06,Republican

Lehrer,"Well, Senator Dole, let me ask you the same question I asked the President: How do you avoid being influenced by people who contribute money and services to your campaigns?",1996-10-06,Moderator
Dole,"I think its very difficult. Lets be honest about it. Thats why we need campaign finance reform. Thats why I reach out to the Perot voters. Weve done about all, we are the reform party, the Republican Party. And the Perot voters that are looking for a home ought to take a look at the Republican record. Whatever it is, whatever the checklist was in 92, its all done with campaign finance reform. I worked with Senator Mitchell, who played me, I guess, in the debate warmup. We tried six or eight years ago. He appointed three people, I appointed three people to get campaign finance reform. We couldnt get it done, because I wasnt enforceable. Youve suggested a commission, Newt Gingrich did, I suggested that at least four or five years ago. We have a commission on campaign finance reform. They send it to Congress, and we have to vote it up or down. Thats how it works. We are never going to fix it by the parties, because Democrats want a better advantage for themselves, we want a better advantage as Republicans, and thats not how its going to work. But I want to touch on this is tobacco thing. I know the Presidents been puffing a lot on that. But I want to go back to 1965. That was my first vote against tobacco companies when I said we ought to label cigarettes. And Ive had a consistent record ever since 1965. We passed a bill in 1992 that encouraged the states to adopt programs to stop kids from smoking. All 50 states did it. It took three and a half years. It wasnt until election year, Mr. President, that you ever thought about stopping smoking. What about drugs that have increased, doubled in the last 44 months? Cocaine is up 141 percent  marijuana, cocaine up 166 percent. It seems to me that you have a selective memory. You know, mine doesnt work that way. So I just want to try to correct it as we go along.",1996-10-06,Republican
Clinton,"Mr. Lehrer, I hope well have a chance to discuss drugs later in the program. But let me respond to what you said. I agree that too many incumbent politicians in Washington in both parties have consistently opposed campaign finance reform. That was certainly the case from the minute I got there. So after Speaker Gingrich and Senator Dole took over the Congress, I went to New Hampshire and a man suggested  a gentleman that unfortunately just passed away a couple of days ago, suggested that we appoint a commission. And I shook hands with him on it and I appointed my members, and the commission never met. And then Senator Doles ardent supporters, Senator McCain, whos out there today, along with Senator Feingold, supported, sponsored a campaign finance reform proposal. I strongly supported it. And members of Senator Doles own party in the Senate killed it. And he was not out there urging them to vote for the McCain-Feingold bill. So I think the American people, including the Perot supporters, know that I have had a consistent record in favor of campaign finance reform, and I will continue to have. And I hope we can finally get it in the next session of Congress, because we need it badly.",1996-10-06,Democrat

These are sophisticated people watching tonight. Millions and millions of Americans. They know the Republican Party hasnt done it. They know the Democratic party wont do it.

Lehrer,"Mr. President, the Senator mentioned drugs. He suggested that you are  you bear some responsibility for the rise in drug use of teenagers in the United States. Is he right?",1996-10-06,Moderator
Clinton,"Well, Jim, I think every American in any position of responsibility should be concerned about whats happened. I am. But lets look at the overall record. Overall in America cocaine use has dropped 30 percent in the last four years, casual drug use down 13 percent. The tragedy is that our young people are still increasing their use of drugs up to about 11 percent total with marijuana, and I regret it. Let me tell you what I tried to do about it. I appointed a four-star general who led our efforts south of the border to keep drugs from coming into the country as our nations drug czar. The most heavily directed, decorated solder in uniform when he retired. We submitted the biggest drug budget ever. We have dramatically increased control and enforcement at the border. We supported a a crime bill that had 60 death penalties including, including the death penalty for drug kingpins. And I supported a big expansion in safe and drug-free schools program to support things like the DARE program because I thought all those things were very important. Do I think that I bear some responsibility for the fact that too many of our children still dont understand drugs are wrong, drugs can kill you. Even though I have consistently opposed the legalization of drugs all my public life and worked hard against them. I think we all do. And I hope we can do better. I dont think this issue should be politicized because my record is clear and I dont think Senator Dole supports using using drugs. I think we just have to continue to work on this until those who think it isnt dangerous and wont kill them and wont destroy their lives, get the message and change.",1996-10-06,Democrat

You dont want to politicize drugs, but its already politicized Medicare, go out and scare senior citizens and other vulnerable groups, veterans and people who get Pell Grants and things like this. I mean, you say weve done all these bad things, which isnt the case. But it seems to me the record is clear. The record is pretty clear in Arkansas, when you were governor. Drug use doubled. You resisted the appointment of a drug czar there because you thought it might interfere with treatment. But here you cut the drug czars office 83 percent. You cut interdiction substantially. I mean thats what, I want to stop it from coming across the border. And in my administration, were going to train the National Guard to stop it from coming across the border. This is a invasion of drugs from all over the world. And we have a responsibility. You had a surgeon  or before General McCaffrey (ph) you had a lady who said we ought to consider legalizing drugs. Is that the kind of leadership we need? And I wont comment on other things that happened in your administration or your past about drugs. But it seems to me the kids ought to  if theyve started, they ought to stop and just dont do it.",1996-10-06,Republican
Lehrer,Mr. President.,1996-10-06,Moderator
Clinton,"Let me say again, we did have a drug czar in Arkansas, but he answered to the governor, just like this one answers to the President. Thats what I thought we ought to do. Secondly, Senator Dole, you voted against the crime bill that had the death penalty for drug kingpins in it. And you voted to cut services to 23 million school children under the safe and drug-free schools act. I dont think that means youre soft on drugs. We just have a different approach. But let me remind you, my family has suffered from drug abuse. I know what its like to see somebody you love nearly lose their lives, and I hate drugs, Senator. We need to do this together and we can.",1996-10-06,Democrat
Lehrer,"Senator Dole, on the government, continuing to talk about the governments role. If elected President, would you seek to repeal the Brady Bill and the ban on assault weapons?",1996-10-06,Moderator
Dole,"Not if I didnt have a better idea. But Ive got a better idea. Its something Ive worked on for 15 years. Its called the automated check or the instant check. Its being used in 17 states right now. States like Florida, Colorado, Virginia, and other states. You dont buy any gun. You dont get any gun. Weve got 20 million names on a computer in Washington, D.C. of people who should not have guns. We ought to keep guns out of the hands of criminals. And, there are eight other categories that should not have guns. Ive been working on this for a long, long time. You walk in, you put your little card in there. If it says tilt, you dont get any gun. You dont get a hand gun, you dont get a rifle, you dont get a shot gun, you get zippo. If were going to protect American children and American families and people who live as prisoners in their own home, weve got to stop guns from being dumped on the street. The administration says they support the instant check. Theyve appropriated about $200 million, but only spent about $3 million to get it underway. In our administration, in my administration, we will expedite. This keeps up with technology. It keeps guns out of the hands of people who should not have guns. That is the bottom line. And I believe its a good idea, has strong bipartisan support. And perhaps thats another thing we can depoliticize. You talk about the Brady Bill. There has only been one prosecution under the Brady  only one under the assault weapon ban and only seven under the Brady Bill that you talk about all the time. And on the assault weapon ban, out of 17 weapons that were banned, only six banned now because eleven have been modified and are back on the street. Lets get together on this instant check because that will really make a difference.",1996-10-06,Republican
Lehrer,Mr. President.,1996-10-06,Moderator
Clinton,"Let me say, first of all, Senator Dole has gone back and forth about whether hed be for repealing the Brady Bill or repealing the assault weapons ban. And I think his present position is he would not do so, and if thats true Im grateful for it. But lets look at the facts here. The Brady Bill has kept at least 60,000 felons, fugitives and stalkers from getting hand guns. Senator Dole led the fight against the Brady Bill. He tried to keep it from coming to my desk. He didnt succeed and I signed it and Im glad I did. Then when we had the assault weapons ban in the Senate, Senator Dole fought it bitterly and opposed the entire crime bill and almost brought the entire crime bill down because the National Rifle Association didnt want the assault weapons ban, just like they didnt want the Brady Bill. But two years later nobodys lost their handguns. I mean, their rifles. Weve expanded the Brady Bill to cover people who beat up their spouses and their kids. And this is a safer country. So Im glad I took on that fight and I believe, with all respect, I was right and he was wrong.",1996-10-06,Democrat
Dole,"Well, the President doesnt have it quite right. I mean, it seemed to me at the time the assault weapon ban was not effective. But thats history. I told the NRA thats history. Youre not going to worry about it anymore. Im not going to worry about it anymore. Lets do something better. Lets stop, you know, playing the political game, Mr. President. Talking about this and this. You add all the states thatve used the instant check and how many weapons they keep, kept out of the hands of criminals. It would far surpass the numbers you mentioned. So in my view, if you want to be protected, you ought to vote for Bob Dole and well get the instant check passed and well keep guns out of the hands of criminals.",1996-10-06,Republican
Lehrer,"Mr. President, Senator Dole said the other day that you practiced a photo-op foreign policy that has lessened the credibility of the United States throughout the world. Is he wrong about that?",1996-10-06,Moderator
Clinton,"If he, thats what he said, hes not right about that. Look at where we are today. The United States is still the indispensable nation in the aftermath of the Cold War and on the brink of the 21st Century. I have worked to support our country as the worlds strongest force for peace and freedom, prosperity and security. We have done the following things: Number one, weve managed the aftermath of the Cold War, supporting a big drop in nuclear weapons in Russia. The removal of Russian troops from the Baltics. The integration of Central and Eastern European democracies into a new partnership with NATO. And, I might add, with the democratic Russia. There are no nuclear missiles pointed at the children of the United States tonight and have not been in our administration for the first time since the dawn of the nuclear age. We have worked hard for peace and freedom. When I took office, Haiti was governed by a dictator that had defied the United States. When I took office, the worst war in Europe was waging in Bosnia. Now there is a the democratically elected president in Haiti. Peace in Bosnia. We just had the election there. Weve made progress in Northern Ireland, in the Middle East. Weve also stood up to the new threats of terrorism. The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, organized crime, and we have worked hard to expand Americas economic presence around the world with the biggest increase in trade with the largest new number of trade agreements in history And thats one of the reasons America is number one in auto production again.",1996-10-06,Democrat
Lehrer,Senator.,1996-10-06,Moderator
Dole,"Well, I have a different view. Again, Ive supported the President on Bosnia, and I think we were told the troops would be out in a year. Now I understand its been extended til some time next year. But, lets start with Somalia, where they dragged Americans through the streets, and where 18 Americans were killed one day, because they didnt have, they were pinned down for eight hours, the rangers. They didnt have the weapons, they didnt have the tanks. They asked for the tanks. They didnt get the tanks from this administration because we were nation building. Its called mission creep. We turn it over to the United Nations. The President didnt have much to do about it. You look at Haiti, where we spend about three billion dollars and we got an alarm call there about two weeks ago. You got to send down some more people, because the presidents found out there are death squads on his on his, in his own property. So we need more protection from America. Bosnia, Northern Ireland. Theres no ceasefire in Bosnia. I think there are still lot of problems in Bosnia. We agreed to train and arm the Muslims so they could defend themselves, the policy you had when you ran in 1992. We havent done that. Were way behind, which means Americans cant come home. Americans shouldnt have gone there in the first place, had we let them defend themselves, as they have a right to do under Article 57 of the United Nations charter.",1996-10-06,Republican
Lehrer,Mr. President.,1996-10-06,Moderator
Clinton,"First of all, I take full responsibility for what happened in Somalia, but the American people must remember that those soldiers were under an American commander when that happened. I believe they did the best they could under the circumstances, and lets not forget that hundreds of thousands of lives were saved there. Secondly, in Haiti, political violence is much, much smaller than it was. Thirdly, in Bosnia its a virtual miracle that there has been no return to war and at least there has now been an election. And institutions are beginning to function. In Northern Ireland, in the Middle East we are better off than we were four years ago. There will always be problems in this whole world. But if were moving in the right direction and America is leading, were better off.",1996-10-06,Democrat
Lehrer,"Senator Dole, if elected president, what criteria would you use to decide when to send U.S. troops into harms way.",1996-10-06,Moderator
Dole,"Well it, after World War I, we had, you know, a policy of disengagement. Then from World War I to World War II we had sort of a compulsory engagement policy. Now I think we have a selective engagement policy. We have to determine when our interests are involved, not the United Nations interests. And many of the things the President talked about, he turned over to the United Nations. They decided. Hes deployed more troops than any president in history around the world. Its cost us billions and billions of dollars for peace-keeping operations. Look these are facts. And it seems to me that when you make a decision, the decision is made by the President of the United States, by the Commander-in-Chief. He makes that decision when he commits young men or young women who are going to go round and defend our liberty and our freedom. That would be my position. Then Im going to have a top down review at the Pentagon, not a bottom up review. We all fight over how much money is there. I want a top down review to determine what our priorities are and what we should do in defense, and then follow that policy instead of this bottom up review with all the services fighting for the money. You know, the President said he was going to cut defense $60 billion, he cut defense $112 billion. Devastated states like California and others. And I think now weve got a problem. Weve got to go back and look. Its just like you said in Texas one day, you know raised taxes too much, and you did, and you cut defense too much, Mr. President, and you did. You may have said that, too. But the bottom line is, we are the strongest nation in the world. We provide the leadership and were going to have to continue to provide the leadership, but lets do it on our terms when our interests are involved and not when somebody blows the whistle at the United Nations.",1996-10-06,Republican
Clinton,"Our military is the strongest military in the world. It is the strongest, best prepared, best equipped it has ever been. There is very little difference in the budget that I proposed and the Republican budget over the next six-year period. We are spending a lot of money to modernize our weapons system. I have proposed a lot of new investments to improve the quality of life for our soldiers, for our men and women in uniform, for their families, for their training. That is my solemn obligation. You ask when do you decide to deploy them. The interests of the American people must be at stake. Our values must be at stake. We have to be able to make a difference. And frankly we have to consider what the risks are to our young men and women in uniform. But I believe the evidence is that our deployments have been successful, in Haiti, in Bosnia, when we moved to Kuwait to repel Saddam Husseins threatened invasion of Kuwait. When I have sent the fleet into the Taiwan straits. When weve worked hard to end the Northern Korean nuclear threat. I believe the United States is at peace tonight in part because of the disciplined, careful, effective deployment of our military resources.",1996-10-06,Democrat

Weve sort of distanced ourselves from our ally, South Korea. They lost about a million people in the war, the Korean War, the forgotten war. We lost 53,000 Americans. We shouldnt be doing any favors for North Korea. Its a closed society. We dont have any inspection. We dont know whether its going to work or not, but we keep giving the incentives. Someone called them something else. Incentives. We dont know whats going to happen. Here we have Cuba 90 miles from our shores, and what have we done, we passed the law that gave people a right to sue and the President postponed it for six months. And it seemed to me if you want to send a signal, youve got to send a signal, Mr. President. The sooner the better off well be, if you put tougher sanctions on Castro, not try to make it easier for him.",1996-10-06,Republican
Lehrer,"Mr. President, what is your attitude toward Cuba and how Cuba should be treated?",1996-10-06,Moderator
Clinton,"Well, first of all, for the last four years we have worked had to put more and more pressure on the Castro government to bring about more openness and move toward democracy. In 1992, before I became President, the Congress passed the Cuba Democracy Act and I enforced it vigorously. We made the embargo tougher but we increased contacts people to people with the Cubans, including direct telephone service, which was largely supported by the Cuban-American community. Then Cuba shot down two of our planes and murdered four people in international air space. They were completely beyond the pale of the law, and I signed the Helms-Burton legislation. Senator Dole is correct. I did give about six months before the effective date of the act before lawsuits can actually be filed, even though theyre effective now, and can be legally binding, because I want to change Cuba. And the United States needs help from other countries. Nobody in the world agrees with our policy on Cuba now. But this law can be used as leverage to get other countries to help us to move Cuba to democracy. Every single country in Latin America, Central America and the Caribbean is a democracy tonight but Cuba. And if we stay firm and strong, we will be able to bring Cuba around as well.",1996-10-06,Democrat
Dole,"Thats the point I made. We have to be firm and strong. And I hope that will happen. It will happen starting next January and maybe it can happen the balance of this year. We have not been firm and strong. You look at the poor people who still live in Cuba. Its a haven for drug smugglers and we dont have a firm policy when it comes to Fidel Castro. In my view, the policy has failed. So Congress passes the law, the President signs it, like he does a lot of things. But he, like welfare reform, Im going to sign it but Im going to try to change it next year. A lot of these election-year conversions, the President talks about the drug money, and all the other things, all this antismoking campaign all happened in 1996. And I think the people viewing out there ought to go back and take a look at the record when he fought a balanced budget amendment. When he gave you that biggest tax increase in history; when he tried to take over your healthcare system. When he fought regulatory reform that cost the average family 6 to $7,000 a year. This is a serious business. Its about your family; its about your business, and in this case its about a firmer policy with Cuba.",1996-10-06,Republican
Clinton,"There were several off-the-subject quaffers in that litany. Let me just mention, Senator Dole voted for $900 billion in tax increases. His running mate Jack Kemp once said that Bob Dole never met a tax he didnt hike. And everybody knows, including the Wall Street Journal, hardly a friend of the Democratic party of this administration, that the 82 tax increase he sponsored in inflation-adjusted dollars was the biggest tax increase in American history. So we ought to at least get the facts out here on the table so we can know where to go from here.",1996-10-06,Democrat

I know you probably would oppose it, Mr. President, but I think we should have a fairer system and a flatter system, and well have a fairer and flatter system and were going to make the economic package work. Healthcare. Well, we finally passed the Kassebaum bill. The President was opposed to it in 1993. He wanted to give us this big system, that took over about one-seventh of the economy, that put on price controls, created all these state alliances, and would cost $1.5 trillion and force people into managed care, whether they wanted it or not. Most people want to see their own doctor. Theyre going to see their own doctor when Bob Dole is president. We wont threaten anybody. So we passed the Kassebaum-Kennedy, the Kennedy Kassebaum bill that will cover about 20 to 25 million people. Weve been for that for four, five, six years. The President held it up. And even when it finally got near passage, Senator Kennedy held it up for 100 days, because he wasnt satisfied with one provision. But it will cover preexisting conditions. If you change your job, youre going to be covered. So there are a lot of good things in this bill we should have done instead of trying this massive, massive takeover by the Federal government. But then of course we had a Democratic Congress and they didnt want to do that. Until we got a Republican Congress, we finally got action, Im proud of my colleagues in the Republican Party for getting that done. It means a lot to a lot of people watching us tonight.",1996-10-06,Republican
Clinton,"Well, that sounds very good, but its very wrong. Senator Dole remembers well that we actually offered not to even put in a healthcare bill in 1994, uh 93, but instead to work with the Senate Republicans and write a joint bill. And they said no because they got a memo from one of their political advisers saying that instead they should characterize whatever we did as big government and make sure nothing was done to aid healthcare before the 94 elections so they could make that claim. Well, maybe we bit off more than we could chew, but were pursuing a step-by-step reform now. The Kennedy-Kassebaum bill that I signed will make it possible for 25 million people to keep their health insurance when they change jobs or when somebody in their familys been sick. I signed a bill to stop these drive-by deliveries when insurance companies can force people out of the hospital after 24 hours and I vetoed Senator Doles Medicare plan that would have forced a lot of seniors into managed care and taken a lot more money out of their pockets and led to Medicare withering on the vine.",1996-10-06,Democrat
Dole,"Well, many of the provisions in the Kassebaum bill were provisions that  my provisions, like deductions for long-term care, making certain that self-employed people that are watching tonight can deduct not 30 percent but 80 percent of you pay for premiums. You can also deduct long-term care now, so its a good its a good start. I think theres enough  were even looking at our tax cut proposal, our economic package. There may be a way of reaching out to the uninsured, because there are a lot of uninsured people in the country, particularly children, that should be covered. Another way you can do is to expand Medicaid. In America no one will go without healthcare, no one will go without food.",1996-10-06,Republican

Lehrer,"Back to foreign affairs for a moment, Mr. President. Are you satisfied with the way you handled this last Iraq crisis and the end result? : Well, I believe that we did the appropriate thing under the circumstances. Saddam Hussein is under a U.N. resolution not to threaten his neighbors or threaten his own, repress his own citizens. Unfortunately, a lot of people, have never been as concerned about the Kurds as the United States has tried to be, and weve been flying an operation to protect them out of Turkey for many years now. What happened was one of the Turkish, one of the Kurdish leaders invited him to go up north, but we felt since the whole world community had told him not to do it, that once he did it we had to do something. We did not feel that I could commit. I certainly didnt feel I should commit American troops to throw him out of where he had gone, and that was the only way to do that. So the appropriate thing strategically to do was to reduce his ability to threaten his neighbors. We did that by expanding whats called the no-fly zone by increasing our allies control of the air space now from the Kuwait border to the suburbs of Baghdad. Was it the right thing to do? I believe it was. Is it fully effective? Did it make him withdraw from the north? Well, he does , he has a little bit, and I hope he will continue. We have learned that you give him an inch hell take a mile. We had to do something, and even though not all of our allies supported it at first, I think most of them now believe that what we did was an appropriate thing to do.",1996-10-06,Moderator
Lehrer,Senator Dole.,1996-10-06,Moderator
Dole,"Well, the presidents own CIA director says Saddam is stronger now than he was. I dont understand extending the no-fly zone in the south when the trouble was in the north. And what weve done during the Bush administration, the Kurds were at the State Department, negotiating, trying to work their differences out. Now weve got all thousands and thousands of refugees. Were even shipping 3,000 Kurds to Guam. It involves Turkey. Its a real problem. Saddam is probably about as strong as he ever was. We shot, what, 44 cruise missiles, worth about a million-two a piece, and hit some radar, that repaired in a couple, three days. Did we inflict any damage? No. Did we have any allies helping? Well, we have Great Britain. Theyre always very loyal to us, and I appreciate that. And of course Kuwait. Even though they had to find out they had 5,000 troops coming, they didnt even understand that. We had to get their permission. The bottom line is, we went in there alone. We are supposed to be operating under a U.N. resolution. We did it without any of our allies that helped in the Gulf.",1996-10-06,Republican

Clinton,"Sometimes the United States has to act alone or at least has to act first. Sometimes we cannot let other countries have a veto on our foreign policy. I could not send soldiers into the north of Iraq, that would have been wrong. It could reduce Saddam Husseins abilities to threaten Kuwait and his other neighbors again. Thats what I did. I still believe it was the right thing to do.",1996-10-06,Democrat

Dole,"Well, there were some good pictures, but does it fall into that category? I dont know. I want to be very serious. Ive supported the President when I thought he was right on Bosnia. I supported him on NAFTA and GATT. So its not that we always disagree. Others disagreed with us. The Mideast is very difficult. But it seemed to me just as an observer that you know before youd call somebody to America, youd have some notion what the end result might be. Now maybe its better just to get together and sit down and talk. Maybe that was the purpose. And I know talks have started again today. But again its almost like an ad hoc foreign policy. Its ad hoc, its sort of we get up in the morning and read the papers, what countrys in trouble, well have a meeting. Now, to me thats not the strategy that I think people expect from America. I think we have lost credibility, and I say this very honestly without any partisanship. Weve lost credibility around the world. Our allies know,  theyre not certain what were going to do, what our reaction, what our response is going to be. Nobody suggested sending troops to Iraq, if that was the hint there from the President. But I do think that Saddam Hussein is stronger than he was. And I do believe that we didnt gain a great deal in the Mideast by bringing three of the four leaders, one refused to come, to Washington D.C.",1996-10-06,Republican
Clinton,"We have a very consistent policy in the Middle East: It is to support the peace process; to support the security of Israel; and to support those who are prepared to take risks for peace. It is a very difficult environment. The feelings are very strong. There are extremists in all parts of the Middle East who want to kill that peace process. Prime Minister Rabin gave his life because someone in his own country literally hated him for trying to bring peace. I would like to have had a big, organized summit, but those people were killing each other, rapidly, innocent Arab children, innocent Israeli people, they were dying. And there is ,so much trust has broken down in the aftermath of the change of government. I felt that if I could just get the parties together to say lets stop the violence, start talking, commit to the negotiations, that would be a plus. Now today the Secretary of State is in the Middle East and theyve started negotiations and all those leaders promised me they would not quit until they resolved the issues between them and got the peace process going forward again.",1996-10-06,Democrat

The killing and tragedies had taken place. And it is unfortunate, it is a difficult area, no doubt about it. It shouldnt be politicized in any way by the President or by his opponent. And I dont intend to politicize it. I hope they talked and I hope theyve reached some result and that the killing will end.",1996-10-06,Republican

Are you saying that you believe Senator Dole is a man of the past and if elected president he would lead the country backward?",1996-10-06,Moderator
Clinton,"Well, Im saying that Senator Dole said in his fine speech in San Diego that he wanted to build a bridge to the past. And I think I know what he meant by that. Hes troubled, as I am, by some of the things that go on today. But I believe America is the greatest country in human history because we have maintained freedom and increasing prosperity by relentlessly pushing the barriers of knowledge, the barriers of the present, always moving into the future. Thats why when I became President I was determined to kind of move beyond this whole stale debate that had gone on in Washington for too long to get this country moving again. And thats why weve got a country with ten and a half million more jobs, and record numbers of new businesses, and rising incomes, and falling crime rates, and welfare roll rates. Thats why were moving in the right direction. And Im trying to emphasize that what I want to do is to continue to do that. Thats why my balanced budget plan will still invest and grow this economy. Thats why I want a tax cut for education and child rearing, but its got to be paid for. Thats why I want to continue the work we have done over partisan opposition, to work with communities to bring that crime rate down until our streets are all safe again. These are my commitments. I am very oriented toward the future. I think this election has to be geared toward the future.

So we always had a rule, we divided by six. Maybe in your case maybe just two. But 11 million new jobs and everything, I mean the President cant take credit for everything that governors are doing, whether thats happening in New York City when it comes to the murder rate and then not be responsible for the bad things that happen, whether its drug use or something else in America. So it seems to me that we can talk about what we call Kenny, the great exaggerator. He just liked to make it sound exager, a little better, made him feel better. When it comes to bridges, I want a bridge to the future. I also want a bridge to the truth. We have to tell the truth. Weve got people watching tonight and listening tonight trying to find the truth. And the truth is, there is a lot wrong with America. We need a strong economic package; we need a tax cut; we need the $500 child credit, and well have that soon.",1996-10-06,Republican

But where I have moved to work with the American people to help them have the tools to make the most of their own lives, I think I should get some credit for that. I also personally took responsibility tonight when Senator Dole asked me about the drug problem. But, you know, I think my ideas are better for the future. Senator Dole voted against student loans, against Headstart, against creating the Department of Education. If he gets elected president, well start the new century without anyone in the cabinet of the President representing education in our children. I personally dont think thats the right kind of future for America, and I think we ought to take a different tack.",1996-10-06,Democrat
Lehrer,"Senator Dole, do you still favor eliminating the Department of Education.",1996-10-06,Moderator
Dole,"Yes. I didnt favor it when it was in, started. I voted against it. It was a tribute after President Carters election to the National Education Association who send a lot of delegates to the Democratic convention, who gives 99.5 percent of their money, Democrat Democrats, and the President, and a lot of the teachers send their kids to private schools or better public schools. So what we want to do is called opportunity scholarships. Now, some say, oh, youre a Republican, you cant be reaching out to these people. Ive reached out to people all my life. Ive worked on the food stamp program, proudly. And the WIC program, and the school lunch program with senators like George McGovern, Hubert Humphrey and others, to name a few of my Democratic friends. Im not some extremist out here. I care about people. I have my own little foundation thats raised about $10 million for the disabled. I dont advertise it. Just did, havent before. And I try to do a lot of things that I think might be helpful to people. So it seems to me that we ought to take that money we can save from the Department of Education, put it into opportunity scholarships and tell little Landale Shakespeare out in Cleveland, Ohio, and tell your mother and father, youre going to get to go to school because were going to match what the state puts up, and youre going to go to the school of your choice. I dont fault the President or the vice president for sending their children to private schools or better schools. I applaud them for it, I dont criticize them. But why shouldnt everybody have that choice. Why shouldnt low income Americans and low middle income Americans. Im excited about it. Its going to be a big, big opportunity for a lot of people.",1996-10-06,Republican
Clinton,"Let me say first of all, Im all for students having more choices. Weve worked hard to expand public school choice in my balanced budget bill. Theres funds for 3,000 new schools created by teachers and parents, sometimes by business people, called charter schools that have no rules, theyre free of bureaucracy and can only stay in existence if they perform and teach children. The ones that are out there are doing well. What Im against is Senator Doles plan to take money away from all the children we now help with limited Federal funds and help far fewer. If were going to have a private voucher plan, that ought to be done at the local level or the state level. But Senator Dole has consistently opposed Federal help to education. He voted against student loans; he voted against my improved student loan plan; he voted against the National Service bill, against the HeadStart bill; he voted against our efforts in safe and drug-free schools. He voted against these programs, he does not believe it. Thats the issue. 90 percent of our kids are out there in those public schools and we need to lift their standards and move them forward with the programs like those Ive outlined in this campaign.",1996-10-06,Democrat
Dole,"Id better correct the President. I dont know what time it is, but its probably getting late. I want to correct, the all these things I voted against, they were probably part of some big package that had a lot of pork in it or a lot of things that we shouldnt have had and we probably voted no. Ive supported all the education programs. Ive supported Headstart, I think we ought to look at it. So I dont want anybody out there to think weve just been voting no, no, no. Lets give low income parents the same right that people of power and prestige have in America and let them go to better schools. Lets not, lets help, lets turn the schools back to the teachers and back to the parents and take it away from the National Education Association.",1996-10-06,Republican
Lehrer,"Mr. President, what is wrong with the school choice proposal?",1996-10-06,Moderator
Clinton,"I support school choice. I support school choice. I have advocated expansions of public school choice alternatives and I said the creation of 3,000 new schools that we are going to help the states to finance. But if youre going to have a private voucher plan, that ought to be determined by states in localities where theyre raising and spending most of the money. I simply think its wrong to take money away from programs that are helping build basic skills for kids, 90 percent of them are in the public schools; to take money away from programs that are helping fund the school lunch program, that are helping to fund the other programs, that are helping our schools to improve their standards. Our schools are getting better, and our schools can be made to be even better still with the right kind of community leadership and partnership at the school level. I have been a strong force for reform. And, Senator, I remind you that a few years ago when I supported teacher testing while in my home state I was pretty well lambasted by the teachers association. I just dont believe we ought to be out there running down teachers and attacking them the way you did at the Republican convention. I think we ought to be lifting them up and moving our children forward. And let me just say that budget that you passed that I vetoed would have cut 50,000 kids out of Headstart. It would have eliminated the AmeriCorps plan and it would have cut back on student loans and scholarships. Now, it would have. Thats a fact. Thats one of the big reasons I vetoed it. We need to be doing more in education, not less.",1996-10-06,Democrat
Dole,"Well, the AmeriCorps program, I must say, if thats one of your successes, I wouldnt speak about it too loudly. It costs about $27,000 to pay people to volunteer. Weve got four million young people volunteering every year, the number hasnt gone down. And you pick out 20,000, whether they need the money or not, and they get paid for volunteering. I like young people. I like teachers. Im a product of a public school. You attended a private school for some time in your life. I like teachers. Youre not for school choice, you cant be for school choice, because this is that special interest money again. When you get 99.5 percent of the money, we dont know what happened to the other .5 percent, were looking for it, somebody got it, but it all went to Democrats. And this is part of that liberal establishment, one of those liberal things that you just cant do. Youre for school uniforms and curfews and youre opposed to truancy. Now thats not reform, Mr. President. Why cant Landale Shakespeare in Cleveland or Pilar Gonzales in Milwaukee give their children an opportunity to go to a better school. Some schools arent safe. Some schools arent even safe. Your choice is nothing. Lets give them a real choice, the kind of choice you had, and the kind of choice a lot of people have in America. If we want to stop crime and teenage pregnancy, lets start with education.",1996-10-06,Republican
Clinton,"First of all, Senator Dole, lets set the record straight. I was able for two years when I was in, a very young boy to go to a Catholic school, but I basically went to public schools all my life. And Ive worked hard for a long time to make them better, 90 percent of our kids are there. You, its amazing to me, you are all for having more responsibility at the local level for everything except schools. Where we dont have very much money at the Federal level to spend on education, we ought to spend it helping the 90 percent of the kids that we can help. If a local school district in Cleveland or anyplace else wants to have a private choice plan like Milwaukee did, let them have at it. I might say the results are highly ambiguous. But I want to get out there and give a better education opportunity to all of our children and thats why I vetoed the budget you passed with $30 billion in education cuts. It was wrong, and my plan for the future is better.",1996-10-06,Democrat

Whom precisely and what precisely did you have in mind?",1996-10-06,Moderator

And their idea was that they knew what was best for the American people. Now, I feel very strongly about a lot of things. I feel strongly about education. I want to help young people have an education, just as I had an education after World War II with the GI bill of Rights. Weve had millions of young men and women in subsequent subsequent wars change the face of the nation because the government helped with their education. Now the reason they dont have, The reason the President cant support this is pretty obvious. Its not taking anything away from schools, its new money. Its not being taken away from anybody else, except well downsize the Department of Education. But this is a very liberal administration. This is an administration that gave you the big tax cut. This administration tried to take over healthcare and impose a governmental system. This is the administration that fought regulatory reform that is putting a lot of small businessmen and small businesswomen out of business. This is the administration that fought the balanced budget amendment and vetoed a balanced budget and vetoed welfare reform twice, and the list goes on and on and on, thats what I had in mind. I want people in my administration and will have people in my administration who understand America. There wont be 10 millionaires and 14 lawyers in the cabinet. There will be people with experience and people who understand America and people whove made it and know the hard knocks in life.",1996-10-06,Republican

And you know this liberal charge, thats what their party always drags out when they get in a tight race. Its sort of their golden oldie, you know. Its a record they think they can play that everybody loves to hear. And I just dont think that dog will hunt this time. The American people should make up their own mind. Heres the record: We cut deficit four years in a row for the first time before the Civil War  I mean, before World War II, and maybe before the Civil War, too. Weve got ten and a half million new jobs; weve got record numbers of those new small businesses. Weve made every one of them eligible for a tax cut. Weve got declining crime rates, two million fewer people on welfare rolls before welfare reform passed, and a 50 percent increase in child support and a crime bill with 60 death penalties and 100,000 police and the assault weapons ban. The American people can make up their mind about whether thats a liberal record or a record thats good for America. Liberal, conservative, you put whatever label you want on it.",1996-10-06,Democrat
Dole,"Well, I think its pretty liberal, Ill put that label on it. You take a look at all the programs youve advocated, Mr. President. Thank goodness we had a Republican Congress there. The first thing you did when you came into office was set up the stimulus package, said weve got a little pork we want to scatter around America, $16 billion. And even some in your own party couldnt buy that. I remember talking by the telephone. Im not even certain you were too excited about that. I wont, I never repeat what Ive talked to the President about. In any event, we saved the taxpayers $16 billion.

I dont believe in discrimination. I believe you can protect the environment and grow the economy. I believe that we have to do these things with a government thats smaller and less bureaucratic, but that we have to do them nonetheless. Its inconvenient for Senator Dole, but the truth is Ive reduced the size of government more than my Republican predecessors. And I did stop them, I admit that. I sure stopped their budget. Their budget cut enforcement for the Environmental Protection Agency by a third. It cut funds to clean up toxic waste dumps with 10 million of our kids still living within four miles of a toxic waste dump, by a third. It ended the principle that the polluters should pay for those toxic waste dumps unless it was very recent. Their budget weakened our support for education. $30 billion, even cut funds for scholarships and college loans. Their budget cut $270 billion in Medicare and, finally, their budget withdrew the national guarantee of healthcare to poor children, families with children with handicaps, the elderly in nursing homes, poor pregnant women.

Ive just finished reading a book, I think its called  what is it called, what is it, The Demise of the Democratic Party by Ronald Cardash (ph) or something talking about all the liberal influences in the administration. Whether its organized labor or whether its the Hollywood elite or whether some of the media elite or whether its the labor unions or whatever. And so I think you take a look at it. The bottom line is this: I think the American people, thought hed recite all these bills and all these things, they want to know whats going to happen to them. Theyve all got a lot of anxieties out there. Did anybody complain when you raised taxes? Did anybody go out and ask the people, how are you going to pay the extra money? Thats why we want an economic package. We want the government to pinch their pennies for a change instead of the people pinching their pennies. Thats what our message is to the people watching.

And then to let people save in an IRA and withdraw from it without a tax penalty for education, home buying or medical expenses, thats the right way to go into the 21st Century, balance the budget and cut taxes, not balloon with this $550 billion tax scheme.",1996-10-06,Democrat

Youve got one parent working for the government, the other parent working for the family. This is important business. This is about getting the economy moving again. This is about American jobs and opportunities. Its about the government, as I said before, pinching its pennies for a change instead of the poor taxpayer. When they raise your taxes nobody runs around asking people where are you going to get the extra money. I think the government can do better. Are there personal differences?",1996-10-06,Republican

Its about my vision for America and about his liberal vision for America. And not about personal things. You know, I think his liberal vision is a thing of the past. I know he wants to disown it. I wouldnt want to be a liberal either, Mr. President, but youre stuck with it because thats your record, thats your record in Arkansas: The biggest tax increase in history.

But the important thing is, what are we going to do now. I think a targeted tax cut is better for our future, targeted to education and child rearing, with the rest of the education plan, hooking up all of our classrooms to the Internet by the year 2000. Making sure weve got an army of reading volunteers, trained people to teach with parents and teachers so that our eight year olds can learn to read. Investing in our environment. Cleaning up two-thirds of the worst toxic waste dumps. Those plans are better than this $550 billion tax scheme. Now, remember, folks, even Senator Doles campaign co-chair here, Senator DAmato, says hes got to cut Medicare to pay for this. Everybody whos looked at it, 500 economists, seven Nobel prize winners, say its bad for the economy. Its going to blow a hole in the deficit Its going to raise taxes on nine million people and require bigger cuts than the one I vetoed.

Getting back to personal differences, I think, Jim, if you are a little more specific, but I think the President could clarify one thing tonight and thats the question of pardons. I know you talked about it on the Jim, with Jim Lehrer on the PBS show. And Ive never discussed Whitewater, as Ive told you personally. Im not discussing Whitewater now. But I am discussing the power the President has to grant pardons. And hopefully in the next segment you could lay that to rest.",1996-10-06,Republican
Lehrer,Mr. President.,1996-10-06,Moderator
Clinton,"Well, first of all, you know, he made that remark about Senator DAmato. Hes arranged for me to spend a lot more time with Senator DAmato in the last couple years so Im more familiar with his comments than I used to be. Let me say what Ive said already about this pardon issue. This is an issue theyve brought up. Its under, theres been no consideration of it, no discussion of it. I will tell you this: I will not give anyone special treatment and I will strictly adhere to the law. And that is what every president has done, as far as I know, in the past but what every other presidents has done. This is something I take seriously and thats my position.",1996-10-06,Democrat
Dole,"But it seems to me the president shouldnt have any comment at all. Particularly where its someone where youve had business dealings. I mean, you may be sending a signal. I dont know, Im not questioning anybody. But as a President of the United States, when somebody asks you about pardons, you say no comment, period. And I think he made a mistake. And I think when you make a mistake, you say I made a mistake. But apparently his position hasnt changed. If there are other specific areas, but beyond that I havent gotten into any of these things, as the President knows. Weve had that discussion. And again I know Senator DAmato I think may have had a hearing or two on Whitewater, I cant remember, but hes not my general chairman, hes a friend of mine. And so is Senator Kennedy a friend of yours.",1996-10-06,Republican
Clinton,You bet.,1996-10-06,Democrat
Dole,"I remember one day on the floor I said now, gentlemen, let me tax your memories, and Kennedy jumped up and said, why havent we thought of that before. You know, so one of your liberal friends.",1996-10-06,Republican

Dole,Whats the subject matter?,1996-10-06,Republican
Lehrer,"Senator Dole, if you could single out one thing that you would like for the voters to have in their mind about President Clinton on a policy matter or a personal matter, what would it be? Something to know about him, understand it and appreciate it.",1996-10-06,Moderator
Dole,"See, if I say anything its going to be misconstrued. I dont think there is even a race between the two, its about our vision for America. I happen to like President Clinton personally. Im addressing him all evening as Mr. President. I said in 1992 he didnt extend that courtesy to President Bush. But I respect the presidency. Ive served under a number of presidents. They all have their strengths and they all have their weaknesses. So Id rather talk about my strengths. And I think I have my strengths and I think the best thing going for Bob Dole is that Bob Dole keeps his word. Its a question between trust and fear, and I would say, I think, Mr. President, about all youve got going in this campaign is fear. Youre spending millions and millions of dollars in negative ads frightening senior citizens. I know this to be a fact because I had one tell me last week, Senator dont cut my Medicare. Im trying to save your Medicare, just as I rescued Social Security with a bipartisan commission. I have relatives on Medicare. I used to sign welfare checks for my grandparents. I know all about poverty and all about need and all about taking care of people, and thats been my career in the United States Senate. And Ill keep my word on the economic package. If I couldnt cut taxes and balance the budget the same time, I wouldnt look at you in the eye in your living room or wherever you might be and say that this is good for America. People will tell you who served with Bob Dole, agree or disagree, he kept his word. Thats what this race is all about.",1996-10-06,Republican
Clinton,"Id like the American people to know that I have worked very hard to be on their side. And to move this country forward and were better off than we were four years ago. But the most important thing is my plan for the 21st Century is a better plan. A targeted tax cut, a real commitment to educational reform. A deep commitment to making welfare reform work with incentives to the private sector to move people from welfare to work. Now we have to create those jobs, now that were requiring people to go do work. A commitment to continuing step-by-step healthcare reform with the next step helping people who are between jobs to access healthcare and not lose it just because they are out of work for a while. A commitment to grow the economy while protecting the environment. Thats what Id like them to know about me; that Ive gotten up every day and worked for the American people and worked so that their children could have their dreams come true. And I believe weve got the results to show were on the right track. The most important thing is, I believe weve got the right ideas for the future. And I like, I like Senator Dole, you can probably tell we like each other. We just see the world in different ways. And you folks out there are going to have to choose who you think is right.",1996-10-06,Democrat
Dole,"Well, Id say the first homeless bill in the Senate was the Dole-Byrd Byrd-Dole bill, I cant remember who was in control then. I remember working with Senator Ribicoff from Connecticut on the Hospice program. We now have 2500 hospices. As I said, Ive worked all my life when I was in the Congress. I left on June 11th because I wanted the American people to know that I was willing to give up something. President Clinton ran for governor in 1990 and said hes going to fill out his term, but he didnt. Hes president so I guess its a little better deal. But I wanted the American people to know I was willing to give up something. I wasnt just getting more power and more power. So I rolled the dice, I put my career on the line because I really believe the future of America is on the line. We can give you all these numbers, they dont mean a thing. If you are out of work, you have nothing to eat or you cant have medical care, or youre holding a crack baby in your arms right now, what do you do next? You know, Americas best days are ahead of us. Ive seen the tough times, I know they can be better and Ill lead America to a brighter future.",1996-10-06,Republican
Lehrer,"Mr. President, what do you say to Senator Doles point that this election is about keeping ones word?",1996-10-06,Moderator
Clinton,"Lets look at that. When I ran for president, I said wed cut the deficit in half in four years; we cut it by 60 percent. I said that our economic plan would produce eight million jobs, we have ten and a half million new jobs. Were number one in autos again, record numbers of new small businesses. I said wed put, pass a crime bill that would put 100,000 police on the street, ban assault weapons, and deal with the problems that ought to be dealt with with capital punishment, including capital punishment for drug kingpins, and we did that. I said we would change the way welfare works, and even before the bill passed wed moved nearly two million people from welfare to work, working with states and communities. I said wed get tougher with child support and child support enforcements up 50 percent. I said that I would work for tax relief for middle class Americans. The deficit was bigger than I thought it was going to be. I think theyre better off, all of us are, that we got the interest rates down and the deficit down. Republicans talk about it, but were the first the first administration in anybodys lifetime looking at this program to bring that deficit down four years in a row. We still gave tax cuts to 15 million working Americans, and now Ive got a plan thats been out there for two years, it could have been passed already, but instead the Republicans shut the government down to try to force their budget and their plan on me, and I couldnt take that. But well get the rest of that tax relief. And so I think when you look at those results, you know the plan Ive laid out for the future has a very good chance of being enacted if youll give me a chance to build that bridge to the 21st Century.",1996-10-06,Democrat
Lehrer,Senator.,1996-10-06,Moderator
Dole,"Well, there he goes again, that line has been used before, I mean, exaggerating all the things that he did. He didnt do all these things. Lets take all these four years in a row. He came in with a high growth rate, the 1990 budget agreement, which some, you know, didnt like, had some very tough cost controls, put a lot of pressure on Congress. The S & L crisis was over, theyre starting to sell assets, all that money was coming in. And he cut defense an extra $60 billion, threw a lot of people out of work. He talks about a smaller government. There are actually more people in government except for people in defense related jobs. Theyre gone. The governments bigger than it was when President Kennedy was around, even though he says its not. In addition, Republican Congress cut $53 billion. So lets just, lets give credit where credit is due. Governor Engler of Michigan cut taxes 21 times, created a lot of new jobs. So did Governor Thompson, so did Governor Rowland. A lot of people ought to deserve credit, Mr. President. When Im President of the United States were going to have a governors council and were going to work directly with the governors to get power back to the people and back to the states.",1996-10-06,Republican
Clinton,"I think a lot of people deserve credit and Ive tried to give it to them. But I believe that my plan is better than Senator Doles ill-advised $550 billion scheme which Ill say again will blow a hole in the deficit. Our plan will balance the budget, grow the economy, preserve the environment, and invest in education. We have the right approach for the future and looks at the results. It is not midnight in America, Senator. We are better off than we were four years ago.",1996-10-06,Democrat
Lehrer,"All right. Thats the last question, the last answer. Lets go now to the closing statements. Mr. President, youre first. Two minutes.",1996-10-06,Moderator
Clinton,"Well, first, Jim, let me thank you and thank you, Senator Dole, and thank you, ladies and gentlemen, all of you listening tonight for the chance youve given us to appear. I want to say in the beginning that I am profoundly grateful for the chance that you have given me to serve as president for the last four years. I never could have dreamed anything like this would come my way in life, and Ive done my best to be faithful to the charge youve given me. Im proud of the fact that America is stronger and more prosperous and more secure than we were four years ago. And Im glad were going in the right direction. And Ive done my best tonight to lay out my plans for going forward to an even better future in the next century. Id like to leave you with the thought that the things I do as president are basically driven by the people whose lives I have seen affected by what does or doesnt happen in this country. The auto worker in Toledo who was unemployed when I was elected and now has a great job because were number one in auto production again. All the people Ive met who used to be on welfare who are now working and raising their children. And I think what others could do for our country and themselves if we did the welfare reform thing in the proper way. I think of the man who grabbed me by the shoulder once with tears in his eyes and said his daughter was dying of cancer and he thanked me for giving him a chance to spend some time with her without losing his job because of the Family and Medical Leave Act. I think of all the people I grew up with and went to school with and who I stay in touch with and who nerve let me forget how what we do in Washington affects all of you out there in America. Folks, we can build that bridge to the 21st Century, big enough and strong enough for all of us to walk across, and I hope you will help me build it.",1996-10-06,Democrat

Dole,"Thank you, Jim; thank you, Mr. President; thank everyone for watching and listening. I want to address my remarks to the young people of America, because theyre the ones that are going to spend most of their life in the 21st Century. Theyre the ones who have the challenges and they are people out there making predictions that its not going to be the same. Youre not going to have the opportunities; there are going to be more deficits, more drugs, more crime, and less confidence in the American people. And thats what youre faced with, the parents are faced with, and the grand parents are faced with. Its important, its their future. And I would say to those I know there are more young people experimenting with drugs today than ever before; drug use has gone up. And if you care about the future of America, if you care about your future, just dont do it. And I know that Im someone older than you. But Ive had my anxious moments in my life. Ive learned to feed myself and to walk and to dress. Im standing here as proof that in America the possibilities are unlimited. I know who I am, and I know where Im from, and I know where I want to take America. We are the greatest country on the face of the earth. We do more good things for more people in our communities, our neighborhoods, than anywhere that I know of. This is important business. This election is important.

Ms. Walters,"Good evening, Im Barbara Walters, moderator of the last of the debates of 1976 between Gerald R. Ford, Republican candidate for president, and Jimmy Carter, Democratic candidate for president. Welcome, President Ford. Welcome, Governor Carter. And thank you for joining us this evening. This debate takes place before an audience in Phi Beta Kappa Memorial Hall on the campus of the College of William and Mary in historic Williamsburg, Virginia. It is particularly appropriate that in this Bicentennial year we meet on these grounds to hear this debate. Two hundred years ago, five William and Mary students met at nearby Raleigh Tavern to form Phi Beta Kappa, a fraternity designed, they wrote, to search out and dispel the clouds of falsehood by debating without reserve the issues of the day. In that spirit of debate, without reserve, to dispel the clouds of falsehood, gentlemen, let us proceed. The subject matter of this debate is open, covering all issues and topics. Our questioners tonight are Joseph Kraft, syndicated columnist; Robert Maynard, editorial writer for the Washington Post; and Jack Nelson, Washington bureau chief of the Los Angeles Times. The ground rules tonight are as follows: Questioners will alternate questions between the candidates. The candidate has up to two and one-half minutes to answer the question. The other candidate has up to two minutes to respond. If necessary, a questioner may ask a follow-up question for further clarification, and in that case the candidate has up to two minutes to respond. As was initially agreed to by both candidates, the answers should be responsive to the particular questions. Finally, each candidate has up to three minutes for a closing statement. President Ford and Governor Carter do not have prepared notes or comments with them this evening, but they may make notes and refer to them during the debate. It has been determined that President Ford would take the first question in this last debate, and Mr. Kraft, you have that first question for President Ford.",1976-10-22,Moderator
Mr. Kraft,"Mr. President, uh  I assume that the Americans all know that these are difficult times and that theres no pie in the sky and that they dont expect something for nothing. Uh  so, Id like to ask you as a first question as you look ahead in the next four years, what sacrifices are you going to call on the American people to make, what price are you going to ask them to pay uh  to realize your objectives? Uh  let me add, uh  Governor Carter, that if  if you felt uh  that it was appropriate to answer that question in  in your comments uh  as to what price it would be appropriate for the American pay  people to pay uh  for a Carter administration, I think that would be proper too. Mr. President?",1976-10-22,Moderator
Mr. Ford,"Mr. Kraft, I believe that the American people, in the next four years under a Ford administration, will be called upon to make those necessary sacrifices to preserve the peace which we have. Which means, of course, that uh  we will have to maintain an adequate military capability  which means, of course, that we will have to add a uh  I think uh  a few billion dollars to our defense appropriations to make certain that we have adequate uh -strategic forces  adequate conventional forces. I think the American people will be called upon to uh  uh  be in the forefront in giving leadership to the solution of those problems that must be solved in the Middle East, in southern Africa, and any problems that might arise in the Pacific. The American people will be called upon to tighten their belts a bit in meeting some of the problems that we face domestically. I dont think that uh  America can go on a big spending spree with a whole lot of new programs uh  that would add significantly to the federal budget. I believe that the American people, if given the leadership that I would expect to give, would be willing to give this thrust to preserve the peace and the necessary restraint at home to hold the lid on spending so that we could, I think, have a long overdue and totally justified tax decrease for the middle-income people. And then, with the economy that would be generated from a restraint on spending, and a tax uh reduction primarily for the middle-income people, then I think the American people would be willing to make those sacrifices for peace and prosperity in the next uh  four years.",1976-10-22,Republican
Mr. Kraft,"Could I be a little bit more specific, Mr. President?",1976-10-22,Moderator
Mr. Ford,"Surely, surely, overlapping. Doesnt your policy really imply that were going to have a fairly high rate of unemployment over a fairly long time, that growth is gonna be fairly slow, and that were not gonna be able to do much  very much in the next four or five years to meet the basic agenda of our national needs in the cities, in health, uh in transit and a whole lot of things like that.",1976-10-22,Republican
Mr. Ford,"Not at all. overlapping, arent those the real costs?",1976-10-22,Republican
Mr. Ford,"No, Mr. Kraft, were spending very significant amounts of money now, some $200 billion a year, almost 50 percent of our total federal expenditure uh  by the federal government at the present time for human needs. Now we will probably need to increase that to same extent. But we dont have to have  growth in spending that will blow the lid off and add to the problems of inflation. I believe we can meet the problems within the cities of this country and still uh  give a tax reduction. I proposed, as you know, a reduction to increase the personal exemption from seven hundred and fifty to a thousand dollars. With the fiscal program that I have, and if you look at the projections, it shows that we will reduce unemployment, that we will continue to win the battle against inflation, and at the same time give the kind of quality of life that I believe is possible in America. Uh  a job, a home for all those thatll work and save for it, uh  safety in the streets, uh  health that is a  health care that is affordable. These things can be done if we have the right vision and the right restraint and the right leadership.",1976-10-22,Republican
Ms. Walters,"Thank you. Governor Carter, your response please.",1976-10-22,Moderator
Mr. Carter,"Well I might say first of all that I think in case of the Carter administration the sacrifices would be much less. Mr. Fords own uh  environmental agency has projected a 10 percent unemployment rate by 1978 if hes uh  president. The American people are ready to make sacrifices if they are part of the process. If they know that they will be helping to make decisions and wont be excluded from being an involved party to the national purpose. The major effort we must put forward is to put our people back to work. And I think that this uh  is one example where uh  a lot of people have selfish, grasping ideas now. I remember 1973 in the depth of the uh  energy crisis when President Nixon called on the American people to make a sacrifice, to cut down on the waste of uh  gasoline, to cut down on the uh  speed of automobiles. It was a  a tremendous surge of patriotism, that I want to make a sacrifice for my country. I think we uh  could call together, with strong leadership in the White House, business, industry and labor, and say lets have voluntary price restraints. Lets lay down some guidelines so we dont have continuing inflation. We can also have a- an end to the extremes. We now have one extreme for instance, of some welfare recipients, who by taking advantage of the welfare laws, the housing laws, the uh  Medicaid uh  laws, and the uh  food stamp laws, make over $10 thousand a year and uh  they dont have to pay any taxes on it. At the other extreme, uh  just 1 percent of the richest people in our country derive 25 percent of all the tax benefits. So both those extremes grasp for advantage and the person who has to pay that expense is the middle-income family whos still working for a living and they have to pay for the rich who have privilege, and for the poor who are not working. But I think uh  uh  a balanced approach, with everybody being part of it and a striving for unselfishness, could help as it did in 1973 to let people sacrifice for their own country. I know Im ready for it. I think the American people are too.",1976-10-22,Democrat
Ms. Walters,"Thank you. Mr. Maynard, your question for Governor Carter.",1976-10-22,Moderator
Mr. Maynard,"Governor, by all indications, the voters are so turned off by this election campaign so far that only half intend to vote. One major reason for this apathetic electorate appears to be the low level at which this campaign has been conducted. It has digressed frequently from important issues into allegations of blunder and brainwashing and fixations on lust and Playboy. What responsibility do you accept for the low level of this campaign for the nations highest office?",1976-10-22,Moderator
Mr. Carter,"I think the major reason for a decrease in participation that we have experienced ever since 1960 has been the deep discouragement of the American people about the performance of public officials. When youve got seven and a half, eight million people out of work, and youve got three times as much inflation as you had during the last eight-year Democratic administration, when you have the highest deficits in history; when you have it uh  becoming increasingly difficult far a family to put a child through college or to own a home, theres a natural inclination to be turned off. Also, in the aftermath of Vietnam and Cambodia and uh  Watergate and uh  the CIA revelations, people have feel  have felt that theyve uh been betrayed by public officials, I have to admit that in the uh  heat of the campaign  Ive been in thirty primaries during the springtime, Ive been campaigning for twenty-two months  Ive made some mistakes. And I think this is uh  uh  part of uh  of just being a human being. I  I have to say that my campaign has been an open one. And uh  the Playboy thing has been of great  very great concern to me. I dont know how to deal with it exactly. Uh  I uh  agreed to give the interview uh  to Playboy Other people have done it who are notable  uh  Governor Jerry Brown, uh  Walter Cronkite, uh  Albert Schweitzer, Mr. Fords own secretary of the treasury, Mr. Simon, uh  William Buckley  many other people. But they werent running for president, and in retrospect, from hindsight, I would not have given that uh  interview had I do it  had it  I to do it over again. If I should ever decide in the future to discuss my  my deep Christian beliefs and uh  condemnation and sinfulness, Ill use another forum besides Playboy. But I can say this, uh  Im doing the best I can to get away from that, and during the next ten days, the American people will not see the Carter campaign running uh  television advertisements and newspaper advertisements based on a personal attack on President Fords character. I believe that the opposite is true with President Fords campaign, and uh  I hope that we can leave those issues in this next ten days about personalities and mistakes of the past  weve both made some mistakes  and talk about unemployment, inflation, housing, education, taxation, government organization, stripping away of secrecy, and the things that are crucial to the American people. I regret the things in my own long campaign that have been mistaken, but Im trying to do away with those the last ten days.",1976-10-22,Democrat
Ms. Walters,"Thank you, Governor Carter. President Ford, your response.",1976-10-22,Moderator
Mr. Ford,"I believe that the uh  American people have been turned off in this election, uh  Mr. Maynard, for a variety of reasons. We have seen on Capitol Hill, in the Congress, uh  a great many uh  allegations of wrong-doing, of uh  alleged immorality, uh  those are very disturbing to the American people. They wonder how an elected representative uh  can serve them and participate in such activities uh  serving in the Congress of the United States. Yes, and Im certain many, many Americans were turned off by the revelations of Watergate, a very, very uh  bad period of time in American political history. Yes, and thousands, maybe millions of Americans were turned off because of the uh  problems that came out of our involvement in Vietnam. But on the other hand, I found on July fourth of this year, a new spirit born in America. We were celebrating our Bicentennial; and I find that uh  there is a  a movement as I travel around the country of greater interest in this campaign. Now, like uh  any hardworking uh  person seeking public office uh  in the campaign, inevitably sometimes you will use uh  rather graphic language and Im guilty of that just like I think most others in the political arena. But I do make a pledge that in the next ten days when were asking the American people to make one of the most important decisions in their lifetime, because I think this election is one of the mast vital in the history of America, that uh  we do together what we can to stimulate voter participation.",1976-10-22,Republican
Ms. Walters,"Thank you, President Ford. Mr. Nelson, your question to President Ford.",1976-10-22,Moderator
Mr. Nelson,"Uh  Mr. President, you mentioned Watergate, and you became president because of Watergate, so dont you owe the American people a special obligation to explain in detail your role of limiting one of the original investigations of Watergate, that was the one by the House Banking Committee? And, I know youve answered questions on this before, but there are questions that still remain and I think people want to know what your role was. Will you name the persons you talked to in connection with that investigation, and since you say you have no recollection of talking to anyone from the White House, would you be willing to open for examination the White House tapes of conversations uh  during that period?",1976-10-22,Moderator
Mr. Ford,"Well, Mr. uh  Nelson, uh  I testified before two committees, House and Senate, on precisely the questions that you have asked. And the testimony under oath was to the effect that I did not talk to Mr. Nixon, to Mr. Haldeman, to Mr. Ehrlichman, or to any of the people at the White House. I said I had no recollection whatsoever of talking with any of the White House legislative liaison people. I indicated under oath that the initiative that I took was at the request of the ranking members of the House Banking and Currency Committee on the Republican side, which was a legitimate request and a proper response by me. Now that was gone into by two congressional committees, and following that investigation, both committees overwhelmingly approved me, and the House and the Senate did likewise. Now, in the meantime, the special prosecutor, within the last few days, after an investigation himself, said there was no reason for him to get involved because he found nothing that would justify it. And then just a day or two ago, the attorney general of the United States made a further investigation and came to precisely the same conclusion. Now, after all of those investigations by objective, responsible people, I think the matter is closed once and for all. But to add one other feature, I dont control any of the tapes. Those tapes are in the jurisdiction of the courts and I have no right to say yes or no. But all the committees, the attorney general, the special prosecutor, all of them have given me a clean bill of health. I think the matter is settled once and for all.",1976-10-22,Republican
Mr. Nelson,"Well, Mr. President, if I do say so though, the question is that I think that you still have not gone into details about what your role in it was. And I dont think there is any question about whether or not uh  there was criminal prosecution, but whether  whether you have told the American people your entire involvement in it. And whether you would be willing, even if you dont control the tapes, whether you would be willing to ask that the tapes be released for examination.",1976-10-22,Moderator
Mr. Ford,"Thats for the uh  proper authorities who have control over those tapes to make that decision. I have given every bit of evidence, answered every question thats as- been asked me by any senator or any member of the House. Plus the fact, that the special prosecutor, on his own initiation, and the attorney general on his initiation, the highest law enforcement official in this country, all of them have given me a clean bill of health. And Ive told everything I know about it. I think the matter is settled once and for all.",1976-10-22,Republican
Ms. Walters,"Governor Carter, your response.",1976-10-22,Moderator
Mr. Carter,I dont have a response.,1976-10-22,Democrat
Ms. Walters,Thank you. Then well have the next question from Mr. Kraft to Governor Carter.,1976-10-22,Moderator
Mr. Kraft,"Uh  Governor Carter, the next big crisis spot in the world may be Yugoslavia. Uh  President Tito is old and sick and there are divisions in his country. Uh  its pretty certain that the Russians are gonna do everything they possibly can after Tito dies to force Yugoslavia back into the Soviet camp. But last Saturday you said, and this is a quote, I would not go to war in Yugoslavia, even if the Soviet Union sent in troops. Doesnt that statement practically invite the Russians to intervene in Yugoslavia? Ah  doesnt it discourage Yugoslavs who might be tempted to resist? And wouldnt it have been wiser on your part uh  to say nothing and to keep the Russians in the dark as President Ford did, and as I think every president has done since  since President Truman?",1976-10-22,Moderator
Mr. Carter,"In the last uh  two weeks, Ive had a chance to talk to uh  two men who have visited uh  the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia and China. One is Governor Avell- Averell Harriman, who visited the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia, and the other is James Schlesinger, whom I think you accompanied to uh  China. I got a- a complete report back from those countries from these two distinguished  uh  gentlemen. Mr. Harriman talked to the leaders in Yugoslavia, and I think its accurate to say that there is no uh  prospect in their opinion, of the Soviet Union invading uh  Yugoslavia should uh  Mr. Tito pass away. The present leadership uh  there is uh  is fairly uniform in  in their purpose, and I think its a close-knit group, uh  and uh  I think it would be unwise for us to say that we will go to war uh  in Yugoslavia uh  if the Soviets should invade, which I think would be an extremely unlikely thing. I have maintained from the very beginning of my campaign, and this was a standard answer that I made in response to the Yugoslavian question, that I would never uh  go to war or become militarily involved, in the internal affairs of another country unless our own security was direc- rectly threatened. And uh  I dont believe that our security would be directly threatened if the Soviet Union went uh  into Yugoslavia. I dont believe it will happen. I certainly hope it wont. I would take eh  the strongest possible measures short of uh  actual military uh  action there by our own troops, but I doubt that that would be an eventuality.",1976-10-22,Democrat
Mr. Kraft,One quick follow-up question. (GOVERNOR CARTER: Yes.) Did you clear the response you made with Secretary Schlesinger and Governor Harriman?,1976-10-22,Moderator
Mr. Carter,"No, I did not.",1976-10-22,Democrat
Ms. Walters,"President Ford, your response.",1976-10-22,Moderator
Mr. Ford,"I firmly believe, uh  Mr. Kraft, that its unwise for a president to signal in advance what uh  options he might exercise if any uhh  international problem arose. I think we all recall with some sadness that at uh  the period of the nin- late nineteen forties, early nineteen fifties, there were some indications that the United States would not include uh  South Korea in an area of defense. There are some who allege, I cant prove it true or untrue, that uh  such a statement uh  in effect invited the North Koreans to invade South Korea. Its a fact they did. But no president of the United States, in my opinion, should signal in advance to a prospective enemy, what his uhh  decision might be or what option he might exercise. Its far better for a person sitting in the White House uh  who has a number of options to make certain that the uh  other side, so to speak, doesnt know precisely what youre going to do. And therefore, that was the reason that I would not uh  identify any particular course of action uh  when I responded to a question a week or so ago.",1976-10-22,Republican
Ms. Walters,"Thank you, Mr. Maynard, your question to President Ford, please.",1976-10-22,Moderator
Mr. Maynard,"Sir, this question concerns your administrative performance as president. The other day, General George Brown, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, delivered his views on several sensitive subjects, among them Great Britain, one of this countrys oldest allies. He said, and I quote him now, Great Britain, its a pathetic thing. It just makes you cry. Theyre no longer a world power. All they have are generals, admirals, and bands, end quote. Since General Browns comments have caused this country embarrassment in the past, why is he still this nations leading military officer?",1976-10-22,Moderator
Mr. Ford,"I have indicated to General Brown that uh  the words that he used in that interview, in that particular case and in several others, were very ill advised. And General Brown has indicated uh  his apology, his regrets, and I think that will, uh  in this situation, settle the matter. It is tragic that uh  the full transcript of that interview was not released and that there were excerpts, some of the excerpts, taken out of context. Not this one, however, that you bring up. General Brown has an exemply [sic] record of military performance. He served this nation with great, great skill and courage and bravery for thirty-five years. And I think its the consensus of the people who are knowledgeable in the military field, that he is probably the outstanding military leader and strategist that we have in America today. Now he did use uh  ill-advised words, but I think in the fact that he apologized, that he was reprimanded, uh  does permit him to stay on and continue that kind of leadership thats we so badly need as we enter into uh  negotiations uh  under the SALT II agreement, or if we have operations that might be developing uh in the Middle East or southern Africa, in the Pacific, uh  we need a man with that experience, that knowledge, that know-how, and I think, in light of the fact that he has uh  apologized, uh  would not have justified my asking for his resignation.",1976-10-22,Republican
Ms. Walters,"Thank you. Governor Carter, your response.",1976-10-22,Moderator
Mr. Carter,"Well, just briefly, I  I think this is uh  the second time that General Brown has made a statement that  for which he did have to apologize. And I know that everybody uh  makes mistakes. I think the first one was related to uh  the unwarranted influence of American Jews on the media and uh  in the Congress. This one concerned uh  Great Britain. I think he said that Israel was a  a military burden on us and that Iran hoped to reestablish the Persian Empire. Ah  Im not uh  sure that I remembered earlier that President Ford had  had expressed uh  his concern about the statement or apologized for it. This is uh  something, though, that I think uh  is indicative of the need among the American people to know how its commander-in-chief, the president, feels and  and  and I think the only criticism that I would have uh  on  of Mr. Ford is that uh  immediately when the statement was re  re  revealed, uh  perhaps a  a statement from the president would have been a clarifying and a very beneficial thing.",1976-10-22,Democrat
Ms. Walters,"Mr. Nelson, your question now to Governor Carter.",1976-10-22,Moderator
Mr. Nelson,"Governor, despite the fact that uh  youve been running for president a long time now, uh  many Americans uh  still seem to be uneasy about you. Uh  they dont feel that uh  they know you or the people around you. And one problem seems to be that you havent reached out to bring people of broad background or national experience into your campaign or your presidential plans. Most of the people around you on a day-to-day basis are the people youve kno- known in Georgia. Many of them are young and relatively inexperienced in national affairs. And uh  doesnt this raise a serious question as to uh  whether you would bring into a Carter administration uh people with the necessary background to run the federal government?",1976-10-22,Moderator
Mr. Carter,"I dont believe it does. Uh  I began campaigning uh  twenty-two months ago. At that time, nobody thought I had a chance to win. Uh  very few people knew who I was. I came from a tiny town, as you know, Plains, and didnt hold public office, didnt have very much money. And my first organization was just four or five people plus my wife and my children, my three sons and their wives. And we won the nomination by going out into the streets  barbershops, beauty parlors, restaurants, stores, in factory shift lines also in farmers markets and livestock sale barns  and we talked a lot and we listened a lot and we learned from the American people. And we built up uh  an awareness among the uh  voters of this country, particularly those in whose primaries I entered  thirty of them, nobodys ever done that before  about who I was and what I stood for. Now we have a very, very wide-ranging group of advisers who help me prepare for these debates and who teach me about international economics, and foreign affairs, defense matters, health, education, welfare, government reorganization. Id say, several hundred of them. And theyre very fine and very highly qualified. The one major decision that I have made since acquiring the nomination, and I share this with President Ford, is the choice of a vice president. I think this should be indicative of the kind of leaders I would choose to help me if I am elected. I chose Senator Walter Mondale. And the only criterion I ever put forward in my own mind was who among the several million people in this country would be the best person qualified to be president, if something should happen to me and to join me in being vice president if I should serve out my term. And Im convinced now, more than I was when I got the nomination, that Walter Mondale was the right choice, And I believe this is a good indication of the kind of people I would choose in the future. Mr. Ford has had that same choice to make. I dont want to say anything critical of Senator Dole, but Ive never heard Mr. Ford say that that was his prim- primary consideration  Who is the best person I could choose in this country to be president of the United States? I feel completely at ease knowing that someday Senator Mondale might very well be president. In the last five pres- vice presidential uh  nominees, uh  incumbents, three of them have become president. But I think this is indicative of what I would do.",1976-10-22,Democrat
Ms. Walters,"President Ford, your response, please.",1976-10-22,Moderator
Mr. Ford,"The Governor may not have heard my uh  established criteria for the selection of a vice president, but uh  it was a well-established criteria that the person I selected would be fully qualified to be president of the United States. And Senator Bob Dole is so qualified: sixteen years in the House of Representatives and in the Senate, uhh  very high responsibilities on important committees. I dont mean to be critical of uh  Senator Mondale, but uh  I was uh  very, very surprised when I read that uh  Senator Mondale made a very derogatory, very personal comment about General Brown uh  after the news story that uh  broke about General Brown. If my recollection is correct he indicated that uh  General Brown was not qualified to be a sewer commissioner. I dont think thats a proper way to describe aayuh- chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff who has fought for his country for thirty-five years, and Im sure the governor would agree with me on that. Uh  I think Senator Dole would show more good judgment and discretion than to so describe uh  a heroic and brave and very outstanding leader of the military. So I think our selection uh  of Bob Dole as vice president uh  is based on merit. And if he should ever become uh  the president of the United States, with his vast experience as member the House and a member of the Senate, as well as a vice president, I think he would do an outstanding job as president of the United States.",1976-10-22,Republican
Ms. Walters,"Mr. Kraft, your question to President Ford.",1976-10-22,Moderator
Mr. Kraft,"Uh  Mr. President, uh  uh  let me assure you then maybe some of the uh viewing audience that being on this panel hasnt been as it may seem, all torture and agony. Uh  one of the heartening things is that uh  I and my colleagues have received uh  literally hundreds and maybe even thousands of suggested questions from ordinary citizens all across the country who want answers.",1976-10-22,Moderator
Mr. Ford,Thats a tribute to their interest in this election.,1976-10-22,Republican
Mr. Kraft,"Ill give you that. Ahh  but, uh  let me go on, because one main subject on the minds of all of them has been the environment. Uh  theyre particularly curious about your record. People  people really wanna know why you vetoed the strip-mining bill. They wanna know why you worked against strong controls on auto emissions. They wanna know why you arent doing anything about pollution uh  of the Atlantic Ocean. Uh  they wanna know a-a bipartisan organization such as the National League of Conservation Voters says that when it comes to environmental issues, you are  and Im quoting  hopeless.",1976-10-22,Moderator
Mr. Ford,"Well, first, uh  let me set the record straight. I vetoed the strip-mining bill, Mr. Kraft, because it was the overwhelming consensus of knowledgeable people that that strip-mining bill would have meant the loss of literally uh  thousands of jobs, something around a hundred and forty thousand jabs. Number two, that strip-mining bill wouldve severely set back our need for more coal, and Governor Carter has said repeatedly that coal is the resource that we need to use more in the effort to become independent of the uh  Arab oil supply. So, I vetoed it because of a loss of jobs and because it wouldve interfered with our energy independence program. The auto emissions  uh  it was agreed by Leonard Woodcock, the head of the UAW, and by the uh  heads of all of the automobile industry, we had labor and management together saying that those auto emission standards had to be modified. But lets talk about what the Ford administration has done in the field of environment. I have increased, as president, by over 60 percent the funding for water treatment plants in the United States, the federal contribution. I have fully funded the land and water conservation program; in fact, have recommended and the Congress approved a substantially increased land and water conservation program. Uh  I have uh  added in the current year budget the funds for the National Park Service. For example, we uh  proposed about $12 million to add between four and five hundred more employees for the National Park Service. And a month or so ago I did uh  likewise say over the next ten years we should expand  double  this national parks, the wild wilderness areas, the scenic river areas. And then, of course, the  the final thing is that I have signed and approved of more scenic rivers, more wilderness areas, since Ive been president than any other president in the history of the United States.",1976-10-22,Republican
Ms. Walters,Governor Carter.,1976-10-22,Moderator
Mr. Carter,"Well, I might say that I think the League of Conservation Voters is absolutely right. This uh  administrations record on environment is very bad. Uh  I think its accurate to say that the uh  strip-mining law which was passed twice by the Congress  uh  and was only like two votes I believe of being overridden  would have been good for the country. The claim that it would have put hundred and forty thousand miners out of work is uh  hard to believe, when at the time Mr. Ford vetoed it, the United Mine Workers was uh  supporting the bill. And I dont think they would have supported the uh  bill had they known that they would lose a hundred and forty thousand jobs. Theres been a consistent policy on the part of this administration to lower or delay enforcement of air pollution standards and water pollution standards. And under both President Nixon and Ford, monies have been impounded that wouldve gone to uh  cities and others to control uh  water pollution. We have no energy policy. We, I think, are the only developed nation in the world that has no comprehensive energy policy, to permit us to plan in an orderly way how to shift from increasing the scarce uh  energy uh  forms: oil, and have research and development concentrated on the increased use of coal, which I strongly favor. The research and development to be used primary to make the coal burning uh  be clean. We need a heritage trust program, similar to the one we had in Georgia, to set aside additional lands that have uh  geological and archeological importance, uh natural areas for enjoyment. Uh  the lands that Mr. Ford uh  brags about having approved are in Alaska and they are enormous in uh  in size. But as far as the accessibility of them by the American people, its very uh  far in the future. Weve taken no strong position in the uh  control of pollution of our oceans, and I would say the worst uh  threat to the environment of all is nuclear proliferation. And this administration, having been in office now for two years or more, has still not taken strong and bold action to stop the proliferation of nuclear waste around the world, particularly plutonium. Those are some brief remarks about the failures of this administration. I would do the opposite in every respect.",1976-10-22,Democrat
Ms. Walters,"Mr. Maynard, to Governor Carter.",1976-10-22,Moderator
Mr. Maynard,"Governor, federal policy in this country since World War II has tended to favor the development of suburbs at the great expense of central cities. Does not the federal government now have an affirmative obligation to revitalize the American city? We have heard little in this campaign suggesting that you have an urban reconstruction program. Could you please outline your urban intentions for us tonight?",1976-10-22,Moderator
Mr. Carter,"Yes, Id be glad to. In the first place, uh  as is the case with the environmental policy and the energy policy that I just described, and the policy for nonproliferation of uh  of nuclear waste, this administration has no urban policy. Its impossible for mayors or governors to cooperate with the resident, because they cant anticipate whats gonna happen next. A mayor of a city like New York, for instance, needs to know uh  eighteen months or two years ahead of time what responsibility the city will have in administration and in financing  in things like housing, uh  pollution control, uh  crime control, education, welfare and health. This has not been done, unfortunately. I remember the headline in the Daily News that said, Ford to New York: Drop Dead. I think its very important that our cities know that they have a partner in the federal government. Quite often Congress has passed laws in the past designed to help people with uh  the ownership of homes and with the control of crime and with adequate health care and education programs and so forth. Uh  those uh programs were designed to help those who need it most. And quite often this has been in the very poor people and neighborhoods in the downtown urban centers. Because of the uh  great -ly- greatly uh  advantaged uh  tho- per  persons who live in the suburbs, better education, better organization, more articulate, more aware of what the laws are, quite often this money has been channeled out of the downtown centers where its needed. Also I favor all revenue sharing money being used for local governments, and also to remove prohibitions in the use of revenue sharing money so that it can be used to improve education, and health care. We have now uh  for instance only 7 percent of the total education cost being financed by the federal government. When uh  the Nixon-Ford Administration started, this was 10 percent. Thats a 30 percent reduction in the portion that the federal government contributes to education in just eight years. And as you know, the education cost has gone up uh  tremendously. The last point is that the major  uh thrust has gotta be to put people back to work. Weve got an extraordinarily high unemployment rate among downtown urban ghetto areas, uh  particularly among the very poor and particularly among minority groups, sometimes 50 or 60 percent. And the concentration of employment opportunities in those areas would help greatly not only to reestablish the tax base, but also to help reduce the extraordinary welfare cost. One of the major responsibilities on the shoulders of uh  New York City is to  is to finance welfare. And I favor a shifting of the welfare cost away from the local governments altogether. And over a longer period of time, let the federal government begin to absorb part of it thats now paid by the state governments. Those things would help a great deal with the cities, but we still have a  a very serious problem there.",1976-10-22,Democrat
Ms. Walters,President Ford.,1976-10-22,Moderator
Mr. Ford,"Let me uh  speak out very strongly. The Ford administration does have a very comprehensive program to help uh  our major metropolitan areas. I fought for, and the Congress finally went along with a general revenue sharing program, whereby cities and uh  states, uh  the cities two-thirds and the states one-third, get over six billion dollars a year in cash through which they can uh  provide many, many services, whatever they really want. In addition we uh  in the federal government make available to uh  cities about uh  three billion three hundred million dollars in what we call community development. In adesh- in addition, uh  uh  as a result of my pressure an the Congress, we got a major mass transit program uh  over a four-year period, eleven billion eight-hundred million dollars. We have a good housing program, uh  that uh  will result in cutting uh  the down payments by 50 percent and uh  having mortgage payments uh lower at the beginning of any mortgage period. Were expanding our homestead uh  housing program. The net result is uh  we think under Carla Hills, whos the chairman of my uh  urban development and uh  neighborhood revitalization program, we will really do a first-class job in helping uh  the communities throughout the country. As a matter of fact, that committee under Secretary Hills released about a seventy-five-page report with specific recommendations so we can do a better job uh  the weeks ahead. And in addition, the tax program of the Ford administration, which provides an incentive for industry to move into our major uh  metropolitan areas, into the inner cities, will bring jobs where people are, and help to revitalize those cities as they can be.",1976-10-22,Republican
Ms. Walters,"Mr. Nelson, your question next to President Ford.",1976-10-22,Moderator
Mr. Nelson,"Uh  Mr. President, your campaign has uh  run ads in black newspapers saying that quote, for black Americans, President Ford is quietly getting the job done. Yet, study after study has shown little progress in desegregation and in fact actual increases in segregated schools and housing in the Northeast. Now, civil rights groups have complained repeatedly that theres been lack of progress and commitment to an integrated society uh  during your administration. So how are you getting the job done for blacks and other minorities and what programs do you have in mind for the next four years.",1976-10-22,Moderator
Mr. Ford,"Let me say at the outset, uh  Im very proud of the record of this administration. In the cabinet I have one of the outstanding, I think, administrators as the secretary of transportation, Bill Coleman. Youre familiar, Im sure, with the recognition given in the Air Force to uh  General James, and there was just uh  approved a three-star admiral, the first in the history of the United States Navy, so uh  we are giving full recognition to individuals of quality in the Ford administration in positions of great responsibility. In addition, uh  the Department of Justice is fully enforcing, and enforcing effectively, the Voting Rights Act, the legislation that involves jobs, housing for minorities, not only blacks but all others. Uh  the Department of uh  uh  HUD is enforcing the new legislation that uhh  outlaws, that takes care of redlining. Uh  what were doing is saying that there are opportunities, business opportunities, educational opportunities, responsibilities uh  where people with talent, black or any other minority, can fully qualify. The Office of Minority Business in the Department of Commerce has made available more money in trying to help uh  black businessmen or other minority businessmen than any other administration since the office was established. The Office of Small Business, under Mr. Kobelinski, has a very massive program trying to help the black community. The individual who wants to start a business or expand his business as a black businessman is able to borrow, either directly or with guaranteed loans. I believe on the record that this administration has been more responsive and we have carried out the law to the letter, and Im proud of the record.",1976-10-22,Republican
Ms. Walters,"Governor Carter, your response, please.",1976-10-22,Moderator
Mr. Carter,"The uh  description just made of this administrations record is hard to uh  recognize. I think its accurate to say that Mr. Ford voted against the uh  Voting Rights Acts and the uh  Civil Rights Acts in their uh  debative stage I think once it was assured they were going to pass he finally voted for it. This country uh  changed drastically in 1969 when the uh  terms of John Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson were over and Richard Nixon and  and Gerald Ford became the presidents. There was a time when there was hope for those who uh  were poor and downtrodden and who were  uh elderly or who were  uh ill or who were in minority groups, but that time has been gone. I think the greatest thing that ever happened to the South was the passage of the Civil Rights Act and the opening up of opportunities  uh to black people  the chance to vote, to hold a job, to buy a house, to go to school, and to participate in public affairs. It not only liberated  uh black people but it also liberated the whites. Weve seen uh  in many instances in recent years a minority affairs uh  section of uh Small Loan Administration, uh  Small Business Administration lend uh  a black entrepreneur just enough money to get started, and then to go bankrupt. The bankruptcies have gone up  uh in an extraordinary degree. Uh  FHA, which used to be a very responsible agency, uh  that everyone looked to to help own a home, lost six million dollars last year. Thereve been over thirteen hundred indictments in HUD, over eight hundred convictions relating just to home loans. And now the federal government has become the worlds greatest slum landlord. Weve got a 30 percent or 40 percent unemployment rate among minority uh  young people. And theres been no concerted effort given to the needs of those who are both poor and black, or poor and who speak a foreign language. And thats where theres been a great uh generation of despair, and ill health, and the lack of education, lack of purposefulness, and the lack of hope for the future. But it doesnt take just a quiet uh  dormant uh minimum enforcement of the law. It requires an aggressive searching out and reaching out to help people who especially need it. And thats been lacking in the last eight years.",1976-10-22,Democrat

Mr. Kraft,"Ah  Governor Carter, ah  in the nearly two-hundred-year history of the Constitution, thereve been only uh  I think its twenty-five amendments, most of them on issues of the very broadest principle. Uh  now we have proposed amendments in many highly specialized causes, like gun control, school busing, balanced budgets, school prayer, abortion, things like that. Do you think its appropriate to the dignity of the Constitution to tack on amendments in wholesale fashion? And which of the ones that I listed  that is, uh  balanced budgets, school busing, school prayer, abortion, gun con- control  which of those would you really work hard to support if you were president?",1976-10-22,Moderator
Mr. Carter,"I would not work hard to support any of those. Uh  weve always had, I think, a lot of constitutional amendments proposed, but the passage of them has been uh  fairly slow, and uh  few and far between. In the two-hundred-year history theres been a very uh  cautious approach to this. We  quite often we have a transient problem. I  Im strongly against a- abortion. I think abortions wrong. I dont think the government oughta do anything to encourage abortion. But I dont favor a constitutional amendment on the subject. But short of the constitutional amendment, and within the confines of the Supreme Court rulings, Ill do everything I can to minimize the need for abortions with better sex education, family planning, with better adoptive procedures. I personally dont believe that the federal government oughta finance abortions, but I  I draw the line and dont support a constitutional amendment. However, I honor the right of people who seek the constitutional amendments on school busing, on uh  prayer in the schools and an abortion. But among those you named, I wont actively work for the passage of any of them.",1976-10-22,Democrat
Ms. Walters,"President Ford, your response, please.",1976-10-22,Moderator
Mr. Ford,"support the uh  Republican uh  platform, which calls for the constitutional amendment that would uh  outlaw abortions. I favor the particular constitutional amendment that would turn over to the states the uh  individual right to the voters in those states uh  the chance to make a decision by public referendum. Uh I call that the people amendment. I think if you really believe that the people of a state ought to make a decision on a matter of this kind that uh  we ought to have a federal constitutional amendment that would permit each one of the fifty states to make the choice. Uh  I think this is a responsible and a proper way to proceed. Uhh  I believe also that uh  there is some merit to a  an amendment that uh  uh  Senator Everett Dirksen uh  proposed very frequently, an amendment that would uh  change the court decision as far as voluntary prayer in public schools. Uh  it seems to me that there should have  be an opportunity, uh  as long as its voluntary, as long as there is no uh  compulsion whatsoever, that uh  an individual ought to have that right. So in those two cases I think uh  such uh  a constitutional amendment would be proper, and I really dont think in either case theyre trivial matters. I think theyre matters of very deep conviction, as far as many, many people in this country believe. And therefore, they shouldnt be treated lightly. But theyre matters that are ah  important. And in those two cases, I would favor them.",1976-10-22,Republican
Ms. Walters,Mr. Maynard to President Ford.,1976-10-22,Moderator
Mr. Maynard,"Mr. President, twice you have been the intended victim of would-be assassins using handguns. Yet, you remain a steadfast opponent of substantive handgun control. There are now some forty million handguns in this country, going up at the rate of two point five million a year. And tragically, those handguns are frequently purchased for self-protection and wind up being used against a relative or a friend. In light of that, why do you remain so adamant in your opposition to substantive gun control in this country?",1976-10-22,Moderator
Mr. Ford,"Uh  Mr. Maynard, uh  the record of gun control, whether its one city or another or in some states, does not show that the registration of a gun, handgun, or the registration of the gun owner, has in any way whatsoever decreased the crime rate or the use of that gun in the committing of a crime. The record just doesnt prove that such legislation or action by a local city council is effective. What we have to do, and this is the crux of the matter, is to make it very, very uh  difficult for a person who uses a gun in the commission of a crime to stay out of jail. If we make the use of a gun in the commission. of a crime a serious criminal offense, and that person is prosecuted, then, in my opinion, we are going after the person who uses the gun for the wrong reason. I dont believe in the registration of handguns or the registration of the handgun owner. That has not proven to be effective, and therefore, I think the better way is to go after the criminal, the individual who commits a crime in the possession of a gun and uses that gun for a part of his criminal activity. Those are the people who ought to be in jail. And the only way to do it is to pass strong legislation so that once apprehended, indicted, convicted, theyll be in jail and off the streets and not using guns in the commission of a crime.",1976-10-22,Republican
Mr. Maynard,"But Mr. President, dont you think that the proliferation of the availability of handguns contributes to the possibility of those crimes being committed. And, theres a second part to my follow-up, very quickly. There are, as you know and as youve said, jurisdictions around the country with strong gun-control laws. The police officials in those cities contend that if there were a national law, to prevent other jurisdictions from providing the weapons that then came into places like New York, that they might have a better handle on the problem. Have you considered that in your analysis of the gu- the handgun proliferation problem?",1976-10-22,Moderator
Mr. Ford,"Yes, I have. And uh  the individuals that uh  with whom Ive consulted have not uh  convinced me that uh  a national registration of handguns or handgun owners will solve the problem youre talking about. The person who wants to use a gun for an illegal purpose can get it whether its registered or outlawed. They will be obtained. And they are the people who ought to go behind bars. You should not in the process penalize the legitimate handgun owner. And when you go through the process of registration, you in effect, are penalizing that individual who uses his gun for a very legitimate purpose.",1976-10-22,Republican
Ms. Walters,Governor Carter.,1976-10-22,Moderator
Mr. Carter,"I  I think its accurate to say that Mr. Fords position on gun control has changed. Uh  earlier, uh  Mr. Levi, his uh  attorney general, put forward a gun control proposal, which Mr. Ford later, I believe, espoused, that called for the prohibition against the uh sale aw- of the uh  so-called Saturday Night Specials. And it wouldve put uh  very strict uh  uh  control over who owned a handgun. I have been a hunter all my life and happen to own both shotguns, rifles, and a handgun. And uh  the only purpose that I would see in registering uh  handguns and not long guns of any kind would be to prohibit the uh  ownership of those guns by those whove used them in the commission of a crime, or who uh  have been proven to be mentally incompetent to own a gun. I believe that limited approach to the  to the question would be uh  advisable, and  and I think, adequate. But thats as far as I would go with it.",1976-10-22,Democrat
Ms. Walters,Mr. Nelson to Governor Carter.,1976-10-22,Moderator
Mr. Nelson,"Uh Governor, youve said the uh  Supreme Court of today is, uh  as you put it, moving back in a proper direction uh  in rulings that have limited the rights of criminal defendants. And youve compared the present Supreme Court under Chief Justice Burger very favorably with the more liberal court that we had under Chief Justice Warren. So exactly what are you getting at, and can you elaborate on the kind of court you think this country should have? And can you tell us the kind of qualifications and philosophy you would look for as president in making Supreme Court appointments?",1976-10-22,Moderator
Mr. Carter,"While I was governor of Georgia, although Im not a lawyer, we had complete reform of the Georgia court system. We uh  streamlined the structure of the court, put in administrative officers, put a unified court system in, required that all uh  severe sentences be reviewed far uniformity. And, in addition to that put forward a proposal that was adopted and used throughout my own term of office of selection of  for all judges and district attorneys or prosecuting attorneys, on the basis of merit. Every time I had a vacancy on the Georgia Supreme Court  and I filled five of those vacancies out of seven total and about half the court of appeals judges, about 35 percent of the trial judges  I was given from an objective panel the five most highly qualified persons in Georgia. And from those five, I always chose the first one or second one. So merit selection of judges is the most important single criterion. And I would institute the same kind of procedure as president, not only in judicial appointments, but also in diplomatic appointments. Secondly, I think that the Burger Court has fairly well confirmed the major and  and most far-reaching and most controversial decisions of the Warren Court. Civil rights  uh has been confirmed by the Burger Court, hasnt been uh  reversed, and I dont think theres any inclination to reverse those basic decisions. The one-man, one-vote rule, which is a very important one that uh  s- struck down the unwarranted influence in the legislature of parsley  uh populated areas of  of the states. The uh  right of indigent or very poor accused persons to uh  legal counsel. Uh  I think the Burger Court has confirmed that basic and very controversial decision of the Warren Court. Also the  the protection of an arrested person against unwarranted persecution in trying to get a false uh  confession. But now I think there have been a couple of instances where the Burger Court has made technical rulings where an obviously guilty person was later found to be guilty. And I think that in that case uh  some of the more liberal uh  members of the uh  so-called Warren Court agreed with those decisions. But the only uh  thing I uh  have pointed out was, what Ive just said, and that there was a need to clarify the technicalities so that you couldnt be forced to release a person who was obviously guilty just because of a  of a small technicality in the law. And  and thats a reversal of position uh by the Burger Court with which I do agree.",1976-10-22,Democrat
Mr. Nelson,"Governor, I dont believe you ans- you answered my question though about the kinds of uh people you would be looking for the court, the type of philosophy uh  you would be looking for if you were making appointments to the Supreme Court as president.",1976-10-22,Moderator
Mr. Carter,"Okay, I thought I answered it by saying that it would be on the basis of merit. Once the uh  search and analysis procedure had been completed, and once Im given a list of the five or seven or ten uh  best qualified persons in the country, I would make a selection from among those uh  persons. If the uh  list was, uh  in my opinion, fairly uniform, if there was no outstanding person, then I would undoubtedly choose someone who would most accurately reflect my own basic politi- political philosophy as best I could determine it. Which would be uh  to continue the progress that has been made under the last two uh  courts  the Warren Court and the Burger Court. I would also like to uh  completely revise our criminal justice system  to do some of the things at the federal level in court reform that Ive just described, as has been done in Georgia and other states. And then I would like to appoint people who would be interested in helping with that. I know that uh Chief Justice Burger is. He hasnt had help from the administration, from the Congress, to carry this out. The uh  emphasis, I think, of the  of the court system uh  should be to interpret the uh  the Constitution and the laws uh  equally between property protection and personal protection. But when theres uh  a very narrow decision  which quite often theres one that reaches the Supreme Court  I think the choice should be with human rights. And uh  that would be another factor that I would follow.",1976-10-22,Democrat
Ms. Walters,President Ford.,1976-10-22,Moderator
Mr. Ford,"Well, I think the answer uh  as to the kind of person that I would select uh  is obvious. I had one opportunity to nominate uh  an individual to the Supreme Court and I selected the Circuit Court of Appeals judge from Illinois, uh  John Paul Stevens. I selected him because of his outstanding record as a Circuit Court of Appeals Judge, and I was very pleased that uh  an overwhelming Democratic United States Senate, after going into his background, came to the conclusion that he was uh  fit and should serve, and the vote in his behalf was overwhelming. So, I would say somebody in the format of uh  Justice Stevens would be the kind of an individual that I would uh  select in the future, as I did him in the past. I uh  believe, however, a comment ought to be made about the direction of the uh  Burger Court, vis-a-vis the uh  court uh  that preceded it. It seems to me that the Miranda case was a case that really made it very, very difficult for the  uh police, the law enforcement people in this country to uh  do what they could to make certain that the victim of a crime was protected and that those that commit crimes uh  were properly handled and uh  sent to jail. The Miranda case, uh  the Burger Court uh  is gradually changing, and Im pleased to see that there are some steps being made by the uh  Burger Court to modify the so-called Miranda decision. Uh  I might make a correction uh  of what uh  Governor Carter said, uh speaking of uh  uh  gun control, uh  yes, it is true, I believe that the sale of uh  Saturday Night S- Specials should be cut out, but he wants the registration of handguns.",1976-10-22,Republican
Ms. Walters,Mr. Kraft.,1976-10-22,Moderator
Mr. Kraft,"Uh  Mr. President, uh  the country is now uh  in uh  in something that your uh  advisors call an economic pause. I think to most Americans that sounds like a  a antiseptic term for uh  low growth, uh  unemployment standstill at a high, high level, uhh  decline in take-home pay, uh  lower factory earnings, more layoffs. Uh, isnt that a really rotten record and doesnt your administration bear most of the blame for it?",1976-10-22,Moderator
Mr. Ford,"Well, Mr. Kraft, uh  I violently disagree with your assessment. And I dont think the record justifies the conclusion that you come to. Uh  let me uh  talk about uh  the economic announcements that were made just this past week. Yes, it was announced that the uh  GNP real growth in the third quarter was at 4 percent. But do you realize that over the last ten years thats a higher figure than the average growth during that ten-year period? Now its lower than the nine-point-point-two percent growth in the first quarter, and its lower than the uh 5 percent growth in the second quarter. But every economist  liberal, conservative that Im familiar with  recognizes that in the fourth quarter of this year and in the fifth quar- uh  the first quarter of next year that well have an increase in real GNP. But now lets talk about the pluses that came out this week. We had an 18 percent increase in housing starts. We had a substantial increase in new permits for housing. As a matter of fact, based on the announcement this week, there will be at an annual rate of a million, eight hundred and some thousand new houses built, which is a tremendous increase over last year and a substantial increase over the earlier part of this year. Now in addition, we had a very  some very good news in the reduction in the rate of inflation. And inflation hits everybody: those who are working and those who are on welfare. The rate of inflation, as announced just the other day, is under 5 percent; and the uh  4.4 percent that was indicated at the time of the 4 percent GNP was less than the 5.4 percent. It means that the American buyer is getting a better bargain today because inflation is less.",1976-10-22,Republican
Mr. Kraft,"Mr. President, let me ask you this. Uh  there has been an increase in layoffs and thats something that bothers everybody because even people that have a job are afraid that theyre going to be fired. Did you predict that layoff, uh  that increase in layoffs? Didnt that take you by surprise? Hasnt the gov- hasnt your administration been surprised by this pause? Uh  in fact, havent you not  havent you been so obsessed with saving money uh  that you didnt even push the government to spend funds that were allocated? MR. FORD; Uh Mr. Kraft, uh  I think the record can be put in this uh  in this way, which uh  is the way that I think satisfies most Americans. Since the depths of the recession, we have added four million jobs. Im- most importantly, consumer confidence as surveyed by the reputable organization at the University of Michigan is at the highest since 1972. In other words, there is a growing public confidence in the strength of this economy. And that means that there will be more industrial activity. It means that there will be a reduction in the uhh  unemployment. It means that there will be increased hires. It means that there will be increased employment. Now weve had this pause, but most economists, regardless of their political philosophy, uh  indicate that this pause for a month or two was healthy, because we could not have honestly sustained a 9.2 percent rate of growth which we had in the first quarter of this year. Now, uh  Id like to point out as well that the United States economic recovery from the recession of a year ago is well ahead of the economic recovery of any major free industrial nation in the world today. Were ahead of all of the Western European country. Were ahead of Japan. The United States is leading the free world out of the recession that was serious a year, year and a half ago. Were going to see unemployment going down, more jobs available, and the rate of inflation going down. And I think this is a record that uh  the American people understand and will appreciate.",1976-10-22,Moderator
Ms. Walters,Governor Carter.,1976-10-22,Moderator
Mr. Carter,"With all due respect to President Ford, I think he ought to be ashamed of mentioning that statement, because we have the highest unemployment rate now than we had at any time between the Great Depression caused by Herbert Hoover and the time President Ford took office. Weve got seven and a half million people out of jobs. Since hes been in office, two and a half million more American people have lost their jobs. In the last four months alone, five hundred thousand Americans have gone on the unemployment roll. In the last month, weve had a net loss of one hundred and sixty-three thousand jobs. Anybody who says that the inflation rate is in good shape now ought to talk to the housewives. One of the overwhelming results that Ive seen in the polls is that people feel that you cant plan anymore. Theres no way to make a prediction that my family might be able to own a home or to put my kid through college. Savings accounts are losing money instead of gaining money. Inflation is robbing us. Under the present administration  Nixons and Fords  weve had three times the inflation rate that we experienced under President Johnson and President Kennedy. The economic growth is less than half today what it was at the beginning of this year. And housing starts  he compares the housing starts with last year. I dont blame him, because in 1975 we had fewer housing starts in this country, fewer homes built, than any year since 1940. Thats thirty-five years. And weve got a 35 percent unemployment rate in many areas of this country among construction workers. And Mr. Ford hasnt done anything about it. And I think this shows a callous indifference to the families that have suffered so much. He has vetoed bills passed by Congress within the congressional budget guidelines job opportunities for two million Americans. Well never have a balanced budget, well never meet the needs of our people, well never control the inflationary spiral, as long as we have seven and a half or eight million people out of work, who are looking for jobs. And weve probably got two and a half more million people who are not looking for jobs any more, because theyve given up hope. That is a very serious indictment of this administration. Its probably the worst one of all.",1976-10-22,Democrat
Ms. Walters,Mr. Maynard.,1976-10-22,Moderator
Mr. Maynard,"Governor Carter, you entered this race against President Ford with a twenty-point lead or better in the polls. And now it appears that this campaign is headed for a photo finish. Youve said how difficult it is to run against a sitting president. But Mr. Ford was just as much an incumbent in July when you were twenty points ahead as he is now. Can you tell us what caused the evaporation of that lead in your opinion?",1976-10-22,Moderator
Mr. Carter,"Well, thats not exactly an accurate description of what happened. When I was that far ahead, it was immediately following the Democratic Convention, and before the Republican Convention. At that time, uh  25 or 30 percent of the Reagan supporters said that they would not support President Ford. But as occurred at the end of the con- Democratic Convention, the Republican Party unified itself. And I think immediately following the Republican Convention, there was about a ten-point spread. I believe that to be accurate, I had 49 percent; President Ford, 39 percent. Uh  the polls uh  are good indications of fluctuations, but they vary widely one from another. And the only poll Ive ever followed is the one that uh  you know, is taken on election day. I was in uh  thirty primaries in the spring, and uh  at first it was obvious that I didnt have any standing in the poll. As a matter of fact, I think when Gallup ran their first poll in December of 1975 they didnt put my name on the list. They had thirty-five people on the list. My name wasnt even there. And at the beginning of the year I had about 2 percent. So the polls to me are interesting, but they dont determine, you know, my hopes or  or my despair. I campaign among people. Ive never depended on powerful political figures to put me in office. I have a direct relationship with hundreds of people around  hundreds of thousands around the country who actively campaign for me. In Georgia alone, for instance, I got 84 percent of the vote, and I think there were fourteen people uh  in addition to myself on the ballot, and Governor Wallace had been very strong in Georgia. Thats an overwhelming support from my own people who know me best. And today, we have about five hundred Georgians at their own expense  just working people who believe in me  spread around the country uh  involved in the political campaign. So, the polls are interesting, but uh  I dont know how to explain the fluctuation. I think a lot of it uh  depends on current events  uh  sometimes foreign affairs, sometimes domestic affairs. But I think our hold uh  of support among those who uh  are crucial to the election has been fairly steady. And my success in the primary season was, I think, notable for a newcomer, from someone whos from outside Washington, who  who never has been a part of the Washington establishment. And I think that well have good results uh  on November the second for myself and I hope for the country.",1976-10-22,Democrat
Ms. Walters,"President Ford, your response.",1976-10-22,Moderator
Mr. Ford,"I think uh  the uh  increase and the uh  prospects as far as Im concerned and the I  less favorable prospects for Governor Carter, reflect that Governor Carter uh  is inconsistent in many of the positions that he takes. He tends to distort on a number of occasions. Uh  just a moment ago, for example, uh  he uh  was indicating that uh  uh  in the 1950s, for example, uh  unemployment was very low. He fails to point out that uh  in the 1950s we were engaged in the war in Vietnam. We  I mean in Korea  we had uh  three million five hundred thousand young men uh  in the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marines. Thats not the way to end unemployment or to reduce unemployment. At the present time were at peace. We have reduced the number of people in the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marines from three million, one hundred  three million, five hundred thousand to two mil- lion one hundred thousand. We are not at war. We have reduced the military manpower by a million four hundred thousand. If we had that many more people in the Army, the Navy, the Air Force, and Marines, our unemployment figure would be considerably less. But this administration doesnt believe the way to reduce unemployment is to go to war, or to increase the number of people in the military. So you cannot compare unemployment, as you sought to, uh  with the present time with the 1950s, because the then administration had people in the military  they were at war, they were fighting overseas, and this administration has reduced the size of the military by a million four hundred thousand. Theyre in the civilian labor market and theyre not fighting anywhere around the world today.",1976-10-22,Republican

Mr. Ford,"For twenty-five years I served in the Congress under five presidents. I saw them work, I saw them make very hard decisions. I didnt always agree with their decisions, whether they were Democratic or Republican presidents. For the last two years, Ive been the president, and I have found from experience that its much more difficult to make those decisions than it is to second-guess them. I became president at the time that the United States was in a very troubled time. We had inflation of over 12 percent, we were on the brink of the worst recession in the last forty years, we were still deeply involved in the problems of Vietnam. The American people had lost faith and trust and confidence in the presidency itself. That uh  situation called for me to first put the United States on a steady course and to keep our keel well balanced, because we had to face the difficult problems that had all of a sudden hit America. I think most people know that I did not seek the presidency. But I am asking for your help and assistance to be president for the next four years. During this campaign weve seen a lot of television shows, a lot of bumper stickers, and a great many uh  slogans of one kind or another. But those are not the things that count. What counts is, that the United States celebrated its 200th birthday on July fourth. As a result of that wonderful experience all over the United States, there is a new spirit in America. The American people are healed, are working together. The American people are moving again, and moving in the right direction. We have cut inflation by better than half. We have came out of the recession and were well on the road to real prosperity in this country again. There has been a restoration of faith and confidence and trust in the presidency because Ive been open, candid and forthright. I have never promised more than I could produce and I have produced everything that I promised. We are at peace. Not a single young American is fighting or dying on any foreign soil tonight. We have peace with freedom. Ive been proud to be president of the United States during these very troubled times. I love America just as all of you love America. It would be the highest honor for me to have your support on November second and for you to say, Jerry Ford, youve done a good job, keep on doing it. Thank you, and good night.",1976-10-22,Republican
Ms. Walters,Thank you President Ford. Governor Carter.,1976-10-22,Moderator
Mr. Carter,"Thank you Barbara (barely audible). The major purpose of an election for president is to choose a leader. Someone who can analyze the depths of feeling in our country to set a standard for our people to follow, to inspire our people to reach for greatness, to correct our defects, to answer difficult questions, to bind ourselves together in a spirit of unity. I dont believe the present administration has done that. We have been discouraged and weve been alienated. Sometimes weve been embarrassed and sometimes weve been ashamed. Our people are out of work, and theres a sense of withdrawal. But our country is innately very strong. Mr. Ford is a good and decent man, but hes in  been in office now more than eight hundred days approaching almost as long as John Kennedy was in office. Id like to ask the American people what, whats been accomplished. A lot remains to be done. My own background is different from his. I was a school board member, and a library board member. I served an a hospital authority. And I was in the state senate and I was governor and Im an engineer, a Naval officer, a farmer, a businessman. And I believe we require someone who can work harmoniously with the Congress, who can work closely with the people of this country, and who can bring a new image and a new spirit to Washington. Our tax structure is a disgrace, it needs to be reformed. I was Governor of Georgia for four years. We never increased sales taxes or income tax or property tax. As a matter of fact, the year before I went out of office we gave a $50 million refund to the property taxpayers of Georgia. We spend six hundred dollars per person in this country  every man, woman and child  for health care. We still rank fifteenth among all the nations of the world in infant mortality. And our cancer rate is uh  higher than any country in the world. We dont have good health care. We could have it. Employment ought to be restored to our people. Weve become almost a welfare state. We spend now 700 percent more on unemployment compensation than we did eight years ago when the Republicans took over the White House. Our people wanna go back to work. Our education system can be improved. Secrecy ought to be stripped away from government and a maximum of personal privacy ought to be maintained. Our housing programs have uh  gone bad. It used to be that the average  uh family could own a house. But now less than a third of our people can afford to buy their own homes. The budget was more grossly out of balance last year than ever before in the history of our country  $65 billion  primarily because our people are not at work. Inflation is robbing us, as weve already discussed, and the government bureaucracy is uh  just a horrible mess. This doesnt have to be. Now I dont know all the answers. Nobody could. But I do know that if the president of the United States and the Congress of the United States and the people of the United States said, I believe our nation is greater than what we are now. I believe that if we are inspired, if we can achieve a degree of unity, if we can set our goals high enough and work toward recognized goals with industry and labor and agriculture along with government at all levels, then we can achieve great things. We might have to do it slowly. There are no magic answers to do it. But I believe together we can make great progress. We can correct our difficult mistakes and answer those very tough questions. I believe in the greatness of our country, and I believe the American people are ready for a change in Washington. Weve been drifting too long. Weve been dormant too long. Weve been discouraged too long. And we have not set an example for our own people. But I believe that we can now establish in the White House a good relationship with Congress, a good relationship with our people, set very high goals for our country. And with inspiration and hard work we can achieve great things. And let the world know  thats very important. But more importantly, let the people in our own country realize that we still live in the greatest nation on earth. Thank you very much.",1976-10-22,Democrat

Frank Mcgee,"Good evening. This is Frank McGee, NBC News in Washington. This is the second in a series of programs unmatched in history. Never have so many people seen the major candidates for president of the United States at the same time; and never until this series have Americans seen the candidates in face-to-face exchange. Tonight the candidates have agreed to devote the full hour to answering questions on any issue of the campaign. And here tonight are: the Republican candidate, Vice President Richard M. Nixon; and the Democratic candidate, Senator John F. Kennedy. Now representatives of the candidates and of all the radio and television networks have agreed on these rules: neither candidate will make an opening statement or a closing summation; each will be questioned in turn; each will have an opportunity to comment upon the answer of the other; each reporter will ask only one question in turn. He is free to ask any question he chooses. Neither candidate knows what questions will be asked and only the clock will determine who will be asked the last question. These programs represent an unprecedented opportunity for the candidates to present their philosophies and programs directly to the people and for the people to compare these and the candidates. The four reporters on tonights panel include a newspaperman and a wire service representative. These two were selected by lot by the press secretaries of the candidates from among the reporters traveling with the candidates. The broadcasting representatives were selected by their respective companies. The reporters are: Paul Niven of CBS, Edward P. Morgan of ABC, Alvin Spivak of United Press International, and Harold R. Levy of Newsday. Now the first question is from Mr. Niven and is for Vice President Nixon.",1960-10-07,Moderator
Mr. Niven,"Mr. Vice President, Senator Kennedy said last night that the Administration must take responsibility for the loss of Cuba. Would you compare the validity of that statement with the validity of your own statements in previous campaigns that the Truman Administration was responsible for the loss of China to the Communists?",1960-10-07,Moderator
Mr. Nixon,"Well first of all, I dont agree with Senator Kennedy that Cuba is lost and certainly China was lost when this Administration came into power in 1953. As I look at Cuba today, I believe that we are following the right course, a course which is difficult but a course which under the circumstance is the only proper one which will see that the Cuban people get a chance to realize their aspirations of progress through freedom and that they get that with our cooperation with the other organi- of the states in the Organization of American States. Now Senator Kennedy has made some very strong criticisms of my part  or alleged part  in what has happened in Cuba. He points to the fact that I visited Cuba while Mr. Batista was in power there. I can only point out that if we are going to judge the Administrations in terms of our attitude toward dictators, were glad to have a comparison with the previous administration. There were eleven dictators in South America and in Central America when we came in, in 1953. Today there are only three left including the one in Cuba. We think thats pretty good progress. Senator Kennedy also indicated with regard to Cuba that he thought that I had made a mistake when I was in Cuba in not calling for free elections in that country. Now Im very surprised that Senator Kennedy, who is on the Foreign Relations Committee, would have made such a statement as this kind. As a matter of fact in his book, The Strategy for Peace, he took the right position. And that position is that the United States has a treaty  a treaty with all of the Organization of American States  which prohibits us from interfering in the internal affairs of any other state and prohibits them as well. For me to have made such a statement would been in direct uh  opposition to that treaty. Now with regard to Cuba, let me make one thing clear. There isnt any question but that we will defend our rights there. There isnt any question but that we will defend Guantanamo if its attacked. There also isnt any question but that the free people of Cuba  the people who want to be free  are going to be supported and that they will attain their freedom. No, Cuba is not lost, and I dont think this kind of defeatist talk by Senator Kennedy helps the situation one bit.",1960-10-07,Republican
Mr. Mcgee,"Senator Kennedy, would you care to comment?",1960-10-07,Moderator
Mr. Kennedy,"In the first place Ive never suggested that Cuba was lost except for the present. In my speech last night I indicated that I thought that Cuba one day again would be free. Where Ive been critical of the Administrations policy, and where I criticized Mr. Nixon, was because in his press conference in Havana in 1955, he praised the competence and stability of the bicta- bict- Batista dictatorship  that dictatorship had killed over twenty thousand Cubans in seven years. Secondly, I did not criticize him for not calling for free elections. What I criticized was the failure of the Administration to use its great influence to persuade the Cuban government to hold free elections, particularly in 1957 and 1958. Thirdly, Arthur Gardner, a Republican Ambassador, Earl Smith, a Republican Ambassador, in succession  both have indicated in the past six weeks that they reported to Washington that Castro was a Marxist, that Raul Castro was a Communist, and that they got no effective results. Instead our aid continued to Batista, which was ineffective; we never were on the side of freedom; we never used our influence when we could have used it most effectively  and today Cuba is lost for freedom. I hope some day it will rise; but I dont think it will rise if we continue the same policies toward Cuba that we did in recent years, and in fact towards all of Latin America  when weve almost ignored the needs of Latin America; weve beamed not a single Voice of America program in Spanish to all of Latin America in the last eight years, except for the three months of the Hungarian uh  revolution.",1960-10-07,Democrat
Mr. Mcgee,"Mr. Morgan, with a question for Senator Kennedy.",1960-10-07,Moderator
Mr. Morgan,"Senator, last May, in Oregon, you discussed the possibilities of sending apologies or regrets to Khrushchev over the U-2 incident. Do you think now that that would have done any good? Did you think so then?",1960-10-07,Moderator
Mr. Kennedy,"Mr. Morgan, I suggested that if the United States felt that it could save the summit conference that it would have been proper for us to have expressed regrets. In my judgment that statement has been distorted uh  by Mr. Nixon and others in their debates around the country and in their discussions. Mr. Lodge, on Meet the Press a month ago, said if there was ever a case when we did not have law an our side it was in the U-2 incident. The U-2 flights were proper from the point of view of protecting our security. But they were not in accordance with international law. And I said that I felt that rather than tell the lie which we told, rather than indicate that the flights would continue  in fact, I believe Mr. Nixon himself said on May fifteenth that the flights would continue even though Mr. Herter testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that they had been canceled as of May twelfth  that it would have been far better that if we had expressed regrets, if that would have saved the summit, and if the summit is useful  and I believe it is. The point that is always left out is the fact that we expressed regrets to Castro this winter; that we expressed regrets  the Eisenhower Administration expressed regrets  for a flight over Southern Russia in 1958. We expressed regrets for a flight over Eastern Germany under this Administration. The Soviet Union in 1955 expressed regrets to us over the Bering Sea incident. The Chinese Communists expressed regrets to us over a plane incident in 1956. That is the accepted procedure between nations; and my judgment is that we should follow the advice of Theodore Roosevelt: Be strong; maintain a strong position; but also speak softly. I believe that in those cases where international custom calls for the expression of a regret, if that would have kept the summit going, in my judgment it was a proper action. Its not appeasement. Its not soft. I believe we should be stronger than we now are. I believe we should have a stronger military force. I believe we should increase our strength all over the world. But I dont confuse words with strength; and in my judgment if the summit was useful, if it would have brought us closer to peace, that rather than the lie that we told  which has been criticized by all responsible people afterwards  it would have been far better for us to follow the common diplomatic procedure of expressing regrets and then try to move on.",1960-10-07,Democrat
Mr. Mcgee,Mr. Vice President.,1960-10-07,Moderator
Mr. Nixon,"I think Kenne- Senator Kennedy is wrong on three counts. First of all, hes wrong in thinking th- er- even suggesting that Mr. Khrushchev might have continued the conference if we had expressed regrets. He knew these flights were going on long before and that wasnt the reason that he broke up the conference. Second, hes wrong in the analogies that he makes. The United States is a strong country. Whenever we do anything thats wrong, we can express regrets. But when the president of the United States is doing something thats right, something that is for the purpose of defending the security of this country against surprise attack, he can never express regrets or apologize to anybody, including Mr. Khrushchev. Now in that connection Senator Kennedy has criticized the President on the ground not only of not expressing regrets, but because he allowed this flight to take place while the summit conference  or immediately before the summit conference occurred. This seems to me is criticism that again is wrong on his part. We all remember Pearl Harbor. We lost three thousand American lives. We cannot afford an intelligence gap. And I just want to make my position absolutely clear with regard to getting intelligence information. I dont intend to see to it that the United States is ever in a position where, while were negotiating with the Soviet Union, that we discontinue our intelligence effort. And I dont intend ever to express regrets to Mr. Khrushchev or anybody else if Im doing something that has the support of the Congress and that is right for the purpose of protecting the security of the United States.",1960-10-07,Republican

Mr. Spivak,"Mr. Vice President, you have accused Senator Kennedy of avoiding the civil rights issue when he has been in the South and he has accused you of the same thing. With both North and South listening and watching, would you sum up uh  your own intentions in the field of civil rights if you become president.",1960-10-07,Moderator
Mr. Nixon,"My intentions in the field of civil rights have been spelled out in the Republican platform. I think we have to make progress first in the field of employment. And there we would give statutory authority to the Committee on Government Contracts, which is an effective way of getting real progress made in this area, since about one out of every four jobs is held by and is allotted by people who have government contracts. Certainly I think all of us agree that when anybody has a government contract, certainly the money that is spent under that contract ought to be disbursed equally without regard to the race or creed or color of the individual who is to be employed. Second, in the field of schools, we believe that there should be provisions whereby the federal government would give assistance to those districts who do want to integrate their schools. That of course was rejected as was the government contracts provision by the special session of the Congress to  in which Mr. Kennedy was quite active. And then as far as other areas are concerned, I think that we have to look to presidential leadership. And when I speak of presidential leadership, I refer for example to our attitude on the sit-in strikes. Here we have a situation which causes all of us concern  causes us concern because of the denial of the rights of people to the equality which we think belongs to everybody. I have talked to Negro mothers. Ive heard them explain  try to explain  how they tell their children how they can go into a store and buy a loaf of bread but then cant go into that store and sit at the counter and get a Coca Cola. This is wrong, and we have to do something about it. So, under the circumstances, what do we do? Well what we do is what the Attorney-General of the United States did under the direction of the President: call in the owners of chain stores and get them to take action. Now there are other places where the executive can lead, but let me just sum up by saying this: why do I talk every time Im in the South on civil rights? Not because I am preaching to the people of the South because this isnt just a Southern problem; its a Northern problem and a Western problem; its a problem for all of us. I do it because its the responsibility of leadership, I do it because we have to solve this problem together. I do it right at this time particularly because when we have Khrushchev in this country  a man who has enslaved millions, a man who has slaughtered thousands  we cannot continue to have a situation where he can point the finger at the United States of America and say that we are denying rights to our citizens. And so I say both the candidates and both the vice presidential candidates, I would hope as well  including Senator Johnson  should talk on this issue at every opportunity.",1960-10-07,Republican

Mr. Kennedy,"Well, Mr. Nixon hasnt discussed the two basic questions: what is going to be done and what will be his policy on implementing the Supreme Court decision of 1954? Giving aid to schools technically that are trying to carry out the decision is not the great question. Secondly, whats he going to do to provide fair employment? Hes been the head of the Committee on Government Contracts thats carried out two cases, both in the District of Columbia. He has not indicated his support of an attempt to provide fair employment practices around the country, so that everyone can get a job regardless of their race or color. Nor has he indicated that he will support Title Three, which would give the Attorney General additional powers to protect Constitutional rights. These are the great questions: equality of education in school. About two percent of our population of white people are  is illiterate, ten per cent of our colored population. Sixty to seventy percent of our colored children do not finish high school. These are the questions in these areas that the North and South, East and West are entitled to know. What will be the leadership of the president in these areas to provide equality of opportunity for employment? Equality of opportunity in the field of housing, which could be done on all federal supported housing by a stroke of the presidents pen. What will be done to provide equality of education in all sections of the United States? Those are the questions to which the president must establish a moral tone and moral leadership. And I can assure you that if Im elected president we will do so.",1960-10-07,Democrat
Mr. Mcgee,Mr. Levy with a question for Senator Kennedy.,1960-10-07,Moderator
Mr. Levy,"Senator, on the same subject, in the past you have emphasized the presidents responsibility as a moral leader as well as an executive on civil rights questions. What specifically might the next president do uh  in the event of an uh  an occurrence such as Little Rock or the lunch-counter sit-ins? From the standpoint of MR, KENNEDY: Well let me say that I think that the president operates in a number of different areas. First, as a legislative leader. And as I just said that I believe that the passage of the so-called Title Three, which gives the Attorney General the power to protect Constitutional rights in those cases where its not possible for the person involved to bring the suit. Secondly, as an executive leader. There have been only six cases brought by this Attorney General under the voting bill passed in 1957 and the voting bill passed in 1960. The right to vote is basic. I do not believe that this Administration has implemented those bills which represent the will of the majority of the Congress on two occasions with vigor. Thirdly, I dont believe that the government contracts division is operated with vigor. Everyone who does business with the government should have the opportunity to make sure that they do not practice discrimination in their hiring. And thats in all sections of the United States. And then fourthly, as a moral leader. There is a very strong moral basis for this concept of equality of opportunity. We are in a very difficult time. We need all the talent we can get. We sit on a conspicuous stage. We are a goldfish bowl before the world. We have to practice what we preach. We set a very high standard for ourselves. The Communists do not. They set a low standard of materialism. We preach in the Declaration of Independence and in the Constitution, in the statement of our greatest leaders, we preach very high standards; and if were not going to be s- charged before the world with hypocrisy we have to meet those standards. I believe the president of the United States should indicate it. Now lastly, I believe in the case of Little Rock. I would have hoped that the president of the United States would have been possible for him to indicate it clearly that uh  the Supreme Court decision was going to be carried out. I would have hoped that it would have been possible to use marshals to do so. But it wou- uh  evidently uh  under the handling of the case it was not. I would hope an incident like that would not happen. I think if the president is responsible, if he consults with those involved, if he makes it clear that the Supreme Court decision is going to be carried out in a way that the Supreme Court planned  with deliberate speed  then in my judgment, providing hes behind action, I believe we can make uh  progress. Now the present Administration  the President  has said  never indicated what he thought of the 1954 decision. Unless the president speaks, then of course uh  the country doesnt speak, and Franklin Roosevelt said: The pre  uh  the presidency of the United States is above all a place of moral leadership. And I believe on this great moral issue he should speak out and give his views clearly.",1960-10-07,Moderator

Mr. Nixon,"Senator Kennedy has expressed some hopes in this field, hopes which I think all Americans would share who want some problem  some progress in this area. But lets look at the performance. When he selected his vice presidential running mate, he selected a man who had voted against most of these proposals and who opposes them at the present time. Let me s- look also at what I did. I selected a man who stands with me in this field and who will talk with me and work with me on it. Now the Senator referred to the Committee on Government Contracts. And yet that very committee of which I am chairman has been handicapped by the fact that we have not had adequate funds; we have not had adequate powers; we havent had an adequate staff. Now in the special session of Congress and also in the session that preceded it, the Democratic Congress  in which theres a two-to-one Democratic majority  was asked by the President to give us the funds and give us the power to do a job and they did nothing at all, And in the special session in which Senator Kennedy was calling the signals, along with Senator Johnson, they turned it down and he himself voted against giving us the powers despite the fact that the bill had already been considered before, that it already had hearings on, and the Congress already knew what it had before it. All that I can say is this: what we need here are not just high hopes. What we need is action. And in the field of executive leadership, I can say that I believe its essential that the president of the United States not only set the tone but he also must lead; he must act as he talks.",1960-10-07,Republican
Mr. Mcgee,Mr. Morgan with a question for Vice President Nixon.,1960-10-07,Moderator
Mr. Morgan,"Mr. Vice President, in your speeches you emphasize that the United States is doing basically well in the cold war. Can you square that statement with a considerable mass of bipartisan reports and studies, including one prominently participated in by Governor Rockefeller, which almost unanimously conclude that we are not doing nearly so well as we should?",1960-10-07,Moderator
Mr. Nixon,"Mr. Morgan, no matter how well were doing in the cold war, were not doing as well as we should. And that will always be the case as long as the Communists are on the international scene, in the aggressive tac- uh  tendencies that they presently are following. Now as far as the present situation is concerned, I think its time that we nail a few of these distortions about the United States that have been put out. First of all, we hear that our prestige is at an all-time low. Senator Kennedy has been hitting that point over and over again. I would suggest that after Premier Kush- Khrushchevs uh  performance in the United Nations, compared with President Eisenhowers eloquent speech, that at the present time Communist prestige in the world is at an all-time low and American prestige is at an all-time high. Now that, of course, is just one factor, but its a significant one. When we look, for example, at the vote on the Congo. We were on one side; they were on the other side. What happened? There were seventy votes for our position and none for theirs. Look at the votes in the United Nations over the past seven and a half years. Thats a test of prestige. Every time the United States has been an one side and theyve been on the other side, our position has been sustained. Now looking to what we ought to do in the future. In this cold war we have to recognize where it is being fought and then we have to develop programs to deal with it. Its being fought primarily in Asia, in Africa, and in Latin America. What do we need? What tools do we need to fight us? Well we need, for example, economic assistance; we need technical assistance; we need exchange; we need programs of diplomatic and other character which will be effective in that area. Now Senator Kennedy a moment ago referred to the fact that there was not an adequate Voice of America program for Latin America. Id like to point out that in the last six years, the Democratic Congresses, of which hed been a member, have cut twenty million dollars off of the Voice of America programs. They also have cut four billion dollars off of mutual security in these last six years. They also have cut two billion dollars off of defense. Now when they talk about our record here, it is well that they recognize that they have to stand up for their record as well. So let me summarize by saying this: Im not satisfied with what were doing in the cold war because I believe we have to step up our activities and launch an offensive for the minds and hearts and souls of men. It must be economic; it must be technological; above all it must be ideological. But weve got to get help from the Congress in order to do this.",1960-10-07,Republican
Mr. Mcgee,Senator Kennedy.,1960-10-07,Moderator
Mr. Kennedy,"Of course Mr. Nixon is wholly inaccurate when he says that the Congress has not provided more funds in fact than the President recommended for national defense. Nineteen fifty-three we tried to put an appropriation of five billion dollars for our defenses. I was responsible for the amendment with Senator Monroney in 1954 to strengthen our ground forces. The Congress of the United States appropriated six hundred and seventy-seven million dollars mare than the President was willing to use up till a week ago. Secondly, on the question of our position in the United Nations. We all know about the vote held this week  of the five neutralists  and it was generally regarded as a defeat for the United States. Thirdly, in 1952, there were only seven votes in favor of the admission of Red China into the United Nations. Last year there were twenty-nine and tomorrow when the preliminary vote is held you will see a strengthening of that position or very closely to it. We have not maintained our position and our prestige. A Gallup Poll taken in February of this year asking the  in eight out of nine countries  they asked the people, who do they think would be ahead by 1970 militarily and scientifically, and a majority in eight of the nine countries said the Soviet Union would be by 1970. Governor Rockefeller has been far more critical in June of our position in the world than I have been. The Rockefeller Brothers report, General Ridgway, General Gavin, the Gaither Report, various reports of Congressional committees all indicate that the relative strength of the p- United States both militarily, politically, psychologically, and scientifically and industrially  the relative strength of the so- of United States compared to that of the Soviet Union and the Chinese Communists together  has deteriorated in the last eight years and we should know it, and the American people should be told the facts.",1960-10-07,Democrat
Mr. Mcgee,Mr. Spivak with a question for Senator Kennedy.,1960-10-07,Moderator
Mr. Spivak,"Senator, uh  following this up, how would you go about increasing the prestige you say were losing, and could the programs youve devised to do so be accomplished without absolutely wrecking our economy?",1960-10-07,Moderator
Mr. Kennedy,"Yes. We have been wholly indifferent to Latin America until the last few months. The program that was put forward this summer, after we broke off the sugar quota with Cuba, really was done because we wanted to get through the O.A.S. meeting a condemnation of Russian infiltration of Cuba. And therefore we passed an authorization  not an aid bill  which was the first time, really, since the Inter-American Bank which was founded a year ago was developed, that we really have looked at the needs of Latin America; that we have associated ourselves with those people. Secondly, I believe that in the ca- that its far better for the United States, instead of concentrating our aid, particularly in the underdeveloped world, on surplus military equipment  we poured three hundred million dollars of surplus military equipment into Laos. We paid more military aid, more aid into Laos po- per  per person than in any country in the world and we ought to know now that Laos is moving from neutralism in the direction of the Communists. I believe instead of doing that, we should concentrate our aid in long-term loans which these people can pay back either in hard money or in local currency. This permits them to maintain their self-respect. It permits us to make sure that the projects which are invested in are going to produce greater wealth. And I believe that in cases of India and Africa and Latin America that this is where our emphasis should be. I would strengthen the Development Loan Fund. And Senator Fulbright, Senator Humphrey and I tried to do that. We tried to provide an appropriation of a billion and a half for five years, on a long-term loan basis, which this Administration opposed. And unless were ready to carry out programs like that in the sixties, this battle for economic survival which these people are waging are going to be lost. And if India should lose her battle, with thirty-five per cent of the people of the underdeveloped world within her borders, then I believe that the balance of power could move against us. I think the United States can afford to do these things. I think that we could not afford not to do these things. This goes to our survival. And here in a country which if it is moving ahead, if its developing its economy to the fullest  which we are not now  in my judgment, well have the resources to meet our military commitments and also our commitments overseas. I believe its essential that we do it because in the next ten years the balance of power is going to begin to move in the world from one direction or another  towards us or towards the Communists  and unless we begin to identify ourselves not only with the anti-Communist fight, but also with the fight against poverty and hunger, these people are going to begin to turn to the Communists as an example. I believe we can do it. If we build our economy the way we should, we can afford to do these things and we must do it.",1960-10-07,Democrat
Mr. Mcgee,Mr. Vice President.,1960-10-07,Moderator
Mr. Nixon,"Senator Kennedy has put a great deal of stress on the necessity for economic assistance. This is important. But its also tremendously important to bear in mind that when you pour in money without pouring in technical assistance at w- as well, that you have a disastrous situation. We need to step up exchange; we need to step up technical assistance so that trained people in these newly developing countries can operate the economies. We also have to have in mind something else with regard to this whole situation in the world, and that is: that as America moves forward, we not only must think in terms of fighting Communism, but we must also think primarily in terms of the interests of these countries. We must associate ourselves with their aspirations. We must let them know that the great American ideals  of independence, of the right of people to be free, and of the right to progress  that these are ideals that belong not to ourselves alone, but they belong to everybody. This we must get across to the world. And we cant do it unless we do have adequate funds for, for example, information which has been cut by the Congress, adequate funds for technical assistance. The other point that I would make with regard to economic assistance and technical assistance is that the United States must not rest its case here alone. This is primarily an ideological battle  a battle for the minds and the hearts and the souls of men. We must not meet the Communists purely in the field of gross atheistic materialism. We must stand for our ideals.",1960-10-07,Republican
Mr. Mcgee,Mr. Levy with a question for Vice President Nixon.,1960-10-07,Moderator
Mr. Nixon,"To combat unemployment we first must concentrate on the very areas to which you refer  the so-called depressed areas. Now in the last Congress  the special session of the Congress  there was a bill: one by the President, one by Senator Kennedy and members of his party. Now the bill that the President had submitted would have provided more aid for those areas that really need it  areas like Scranton and Wilkes-Barre and the areas of West Virginia  than the ones that Senator Kennedy was supporting. On the other hand we found that the bill got into the legislative difficulties and consequently no action was taken. So point one, at the highest priority we must get a bill for depressed areas through the next Congress. I have made recommendations on that and I have discussed them previously and I will spell them out further in the campaign. Second, as we consider this problem of unemployment, we have to realize where it is. In analyzing the figures we will find that our unemployment exists among the older citizens; it exists also among those who are inadequately trained; that is, those who do not have an adequate opportunity for education. It also exists among minority groups. If were going to combat unemployment, then, we have to do a better job in these areas. Thats why I have a program for education, a program in the case of equal job opportunities, and one that would also deal with our older citizens. Now finally, with regard to the whole problem of combating recession, as you call it, we must use the full resources of the government in these respects: one, we must see to it that credit is expanded as we go into any recessionary period  and understand, I do not believe were going into a recession. I believe this economy is sound and that were going to move up. But second, in addition to that, if we do get into a recessionary period we should move on that part of the economy which is represented by the private sector, and I mean stimulate that part of the economy that can create jobs  the private sector of the economy. This means through tax reform and if necessary tax cuts that will stimulate more jobs. I favor that rather than massive federal spending programs which will come into effect usually long after youve passed through the recessionary period. So we must use all of these weapons for the purpose of combating recession if it should come. But I do not expect it to come.",1960-10-07,Republican
Mr. Mcgee,Senator Kennedy.,1960-10-07,Moderator
Mr. Kennedy,"Well Mr. Nixon has stated the record inaccurately in regard to the depressed area bill. Im very familiar with it. It came out of the committee of which I was the chairman  the labor subcommittee  in fifty-five. I was the floor manager. We passed an area redevelopment bill far more effective than the bill the Administration suggested, on two occasions, and the President vetoed it both times. We passed a bill again this year in the cong- in the Senate and it died in the Rules Committee of the House of Representatives. Let me make it very clear that the bill that Mr. Nixon talked about did not mention Wilkes-Barre or Scranton; it did not mention West Virginia. Our bill was far more effective. The bill introduced and erd- sponsored by Senator Douglas was far more effective in trying to stimulate the economy of those areas. Secondly, he has mentioned the problem of our older citizens. I cannot still understand why this Administration and Mr. Nixon oppose putting medical care for the aged under Social Security to give them some security. Third, I believe we should step up the use of our surplus foods in these areas until were able to get the people back to work. Five cents a day  thats what the food package averages per person. Fourthly, I believe we should not carry out a hard money, high interest rate policy which helped intensify certainly the recession of 1958, and I think helped bring the slow-down of 1960. If we move into a recession in sixty-one, then I would agree that we have to put more money into the economy, and it can be done by either one of the two methods discussed. One is by ex- the programs such as aid to education. The other would be to make a judgment on whats the most effective tax program to stimulate our economy.",1960-10-07,Democrat

And in a speech last weekend you said you had no quarrel with the President. Now isnt Mr. Eisenhower and not Mr. Nixon responsible for any such decline?",1960-10-07,Moderator
Mr. Kennedy,"Well I understood that this was the Eisenhower-Nixon Administration according to all the Republican uh  propaganda that Ive read. The question is what were going to do in the future. Ive been critical of this Administration and Ive been critical of the President. In fact uh  Mr. Nixon uh  discussed that a week ago in a speech. I believe that our power and prestige in the last eight years has declined. Now what is the issue is what were going to do in the future. Now thats an issue between Mr. Nixon and myself. He feels that were moving ahead uh  in a  were not going into a recession in this country, economically; he feels that our power and prestige is stronger than it ever was relative to that of the Communists, that were moving ahead. I disagree. And I believe the American people have to make the choice on November eighth between the view of whether we have to move ahead faster, whether what were doing now is not satisfactory, whether we have to build greater strength at home and abroad and Mr. Nixons view. Thats the great issue. President Eisenhower moves from the scene on January twentieth and the next four years are the critical years. And thats the debate. Thats the argument between Mr. Nixon and myself and on that issue the American people have to make their judgment and I think its a important judgment. I think in many ways this election is more important than any since 1932, or certainly almost any in this century. Because we disagree very fundamentally on the position of the United States, and if his view prevails then I think thats going to bring an important result to this country in the sixties. If our view prevails that we have to do more, that we have to make a greater national and international effort, that we have lost prestige in Latin America  the President of Brazil  the new incumbent running for office called on Castro during his campaign because he thought it was important to get the vote of those who were supporting Castro in Latin America. In Africa, the United States has ignored Latin uh  Africa. We gave more scholarships to the Congo  this summer we offered them  than weve given to all of Africa the year before. Less than two hundred for all the countries of Africa and they need trained leadership more than anything. Weve been uh  having a very clear decision in the last eight years. Mr. Nixon has been part of that Administration. Hes had experience in it. And I believe this Administration has not met its responsibilities in the last eight years, that our power relative to that of the Communists is declining, that were facing a very hazardous time in the sixties, and unless the United States begin to move here  unless we start to go ahead  I dont believe that were going to meet our responsibility to our own people or to the cause of freedom. I think the choice is clear and it involves the future.",1960-10-07,Democrat

In our first debate he indicated that I had not had experience or at least uh  had not participated significantly in the making of the decisions. Im glad to hear tonight that he does suggest that I have had some experience. Let me make my position cl ear. I have participated in the discussions leading to the decisions in this Administration. Im proud of the record of this Administration. I dont stand on it because it isnt something to stand on but something to build on. Now looking at Senator Kennedys credentials: he is suggesting that he will move America faster and further than I will. But what does he offer? He offers retreads of programs that failed. I submit to you that as you look at his programs, his program for example with regard to the Federal Reserve and uh  free money or loose money uh  high  low interest rates, his program in the economic field generally are the programs that were adopted and tried during the Truman Administration. And when we compare the economic progress of this country in the Truman Administration with that of the Eisenhower Administration, we find that in every index there has been a tr- great deal more performance and more progress in this Administration than in that one. I say the programs and the leadership that failed then is not the program and the leadership that America needs now. I say that the American people dont want to go back to those policies. And incidentally if Senator Kennedy disagrees, he should indicate where he believes those policies are different from those hes advocating today.",1960-10-07,Republican

Mr. Spivak,"Mr. Vice President, according to news dispatches Soviet Premier Khrushchev said today that Prime Minister Macmillan had assured him that there would be a summit conference next year after the presidential elections. Have you given any cause for such assurance, and do you consider it desirable or even possible that there would be a summit conference next year if Mr. Khrushchev persists in the conditions hes laid down?",1960-10-07,Moderator
Mr. Nixon,"No, of course I havent talked to Prime Minister Macmillan. It would not be appropriate for me to do so. The President is still going to be president for the next four months and he, of course, is the only one who could commit this country in this period. As far as a summit conference is concerned, I want to make my position absolutely clear. I would be willing as president to meet with Mr. Khrushchev or any other world leader if it would serve the cause of peace. I would not be able wou- would be willing to meet with him however, unless there were preparations for that conference which would give us some reasonable certainty  some reasonable certainty  that you were going to have some success. We must not build up the hopes of the world and then dash them as was the case in Paris. There, Mr. Khrushchev came to that conference determined to break it up. He was going to break it up because he would  knew that he wasnt going to get his way on Berlin and on the other key matters with which he was concerned at the Paris Conference. Now, if were going to have another summit conference, there must be negotiations at the diplomatic level  the ambassadors, the Secretaries of State, and others at that level  prior to that time, which will delineate the issues and which will prepare the way for the heads of state to meet and make some progress. Otherwise, if we find the heads of state meeting and not making progress, we will find that the cause of peace will have been hurt rather than helped. So under these circumstances, I, therefore, strongly urge and I will strongly hold, if I have the opportunity to urge or to hold  this position: that any summit conference would be gone into only after the most careful preparation and only after Mr. Khrushchev  after his disgraceful conduct at Paris, after his disgraceful conduct at the United Nations  gave some assurance that he really wanted to sit down and talk and to accomplish something and not just to make propaganda.",1960-10-07,Republican

Mr. Kennedy,"I have no disagreement with the Vice Presidents position on that. It  my view is the same as his. Let me say there is only one uh  point I would add. That before we go into the summit, before we ever meet again, I think its important that the United States build its strength; that it build its military strength as well as its own economic strength. If we negotiate from a position where the power balance or wave is moving away from us, its extremely difficult to reach a successful decision on Berlin as well as the other questions. Now the next president of the United States in his first year is going to be confronted with a very serious question on our defense of Berlin, our commitment to Berlin. Its going to be a test of our nerve and will. Its going to be a test of our strength. And because were going to move in sixty-one and two, partly because we have not maintained our strength with sufficient vigor in the last years, I believe that before we meet that crisis, that the next president of the United States should send a message to Congress asking for a revitalization of our military strength, because come spring or late in the winter were going to be face to face with the most serious Berlin crisis since l949 or fifty. On the question of the summit, I agree with the position of Mr. Nixon. I would not meet Mr. Khrushchev unless there were some agreements at the secondary level  foreign ministers or ambassadors  which would indicate that the meeting would have some hope of success, or a useful exchange of ideas.",1960-10-07,Democrat

Since that time you have spelled out many of the things that you intend to do but you have made only vague reference to sacrifice and self-denial. A year or so ago, I believe, you said that you would not hesitate to recommend a tax increase if you considered it necessary.",1960-10-07,Moderator

Mr. Levy,Is this what you have in mind?,1960-10-07,Moderator
Mr. Kennedy,"Well I dont think that in the winter of sixty-one under present economic conditions, it uh  a  uh  tax uh  increase would be desirable. In fact, it would be deflationary; it would cause great unemployment; it would cause a real slowdown in our economy. If it ever becomes necessary, and is wise economically and essential to our security, I would have no hesitancy in suggesting a tax increase or any other policy which would defend the United States. I have talked in every speech about the fact that these are going to be very difficult times in the nineteen-sixties and that were going to have to meet our responsibilities as citizens. Im talking about a national mood. Im talking about our willingness to bear any burdens in order to maintain our own freedom and in order to meet our freedom around the globe. We dont know what the futures going to bring. But I would not want anyone to elect me uh  president of the United States  or vote for me  under the expectation that life would be easier if I were elected. Now, many of the programs that Im talking about  economic growth, care for the aged, development of our natural resources  build the strength of the United States. Thats how the United States began to prepare for its great actions in World War II and in the post-war period. If were moving ahead, if were providing a viable economy, if our people have sufficient resources so that they can consume what we produce; then this countrys on the move, then were stronger, then we set a better example to the world. So we have the problem of not only building our own uh  military strength and extending uh  our policies abroad, we have to do a job here at home. So I believe that the policies that I recommend came under the general heading of strengthening the United States. Were using our steel capacity fifty-five per cent today. Were not able to consume what were able to produce at a time when the Soviet Union is making great economic gains. And all I say is, I dont know what the sixties will bring  except I think they will bring hard times in the uh  international sphere; I hope we can move ahead here at home in the United States; Im confident we can do a far better job of mobilizing our economy and resources in the United States. And I merely say that they  if they elect me president, I will do my best to carry the United States through a difficult period; but I would not want people to elect me because I promised them the easy, soft life. I think its going to be difficult; but Im confident that this country can meet its responsibilities.",1960-10-07,Democrat
Mr. Mcgee,Mr. Vice President.,1960-10-07,Moderator
Mr. Nixon,"Well I think we should be no  under no illusions whatever about what the responsibilities of the American people will be in the sixties. Our expenditures for defense, our expenditures for mutual security, our expenditures for economic assistance and technical assistance are not going to get less. In my opinion theyre going to be de- be greater. I think it may be necessary that we have more taxes. I hope not. I hope we can economize elsewhere so that we dont have to. But I would have no hesitation to ask the American people to pay the taxes even in l961  if necessary  to maintain a sound economy and also to maintain a sound dollar. Because when you do not tax, and tax enough to pay for your outgo, you pay it many times over in higher prices and inflation; and I simply will not do that. I think I should also add that as far as Senator Kennedys proposals are concerned, if he intends to carry out his platform  the one adopted in Los Angeles  it is just impossible for him to make good on those promises without raising taxes or without having a rise in t- prices or both. The platform suggests that it can be done through economic growth; that it can be done, in effect, with mirrors. But it isnt going to be working that way. You cant add billions of dollars to our expenditures and not pay for it. After all, it isnt paid for by my money, it isnt paid for by his, but by the peoples money.",1960-10-07,Republican
Mr. Mcgee,Mr. Niven with a question for Vice President Nixon.,1960-10-07,Moderator
Mr. Niven,"Mr. Vice President, you said that while Mr. Khrushchev is here, Senator Kennedy should talk about whats right with this country as well as whats wrong with the country. In the 1952 campaign when you were Republican candidate for Vice President, and we were eh  at war with the Communists, did you feel a similar responsibility to t- talk about what was right with the country?",1960-10-07,Moderator
Mr. Nixon,"I did. And as I pointed out in 1952, I made it very clear that as far as the Korean War was concerned, that I felt that the decision to go into the war in Korea was right and necessary. What I criticized were the policies that made it necessary to go to Korea. Now incidentally, I should point out here that Senator Kennedy has attacked our foreign policy. Hes said that its been a policy that has led to defeat and retreat. And Id like to know where have we been defeated and where have we retreated? In the Truman Administration, six hundred million people went behind the Iron Curtain including the satellite countries of Eastern Europe and Communist China. In this Administration weve stopped them at Quemoy and Matsu; weve stopped them in Indochina; weve stopped them in Lebanon; weve stopped them in other parts of the world. I would also like to point out that as far as Senator Kennedys comments are concerned, I think he has a perfect right and a responsibility to criticize this Administration whenever he thinks were wrong. But he has a responsibility to be accurate, and not to misstate the case. I dont think he should say that our prestige is at an all-time low. I think this is very harmful at a time Mr. Khrushchev is here  harmful because its wrong. I dont think it was helpful when he suggested  and Im glad hes corrected this to an extent  that seventeen million people go to bed hungry every night in the United States. Now this just wasnt true. Now, there are people who go to bed hungry in the United States  far less, incidentally, than used to go to bed hungry when we came into power at the end of the Truman Administration. But the thing that is right about the United States, it should be emphasized, is that less people go to bed hungry in the United States than in any major country in the world. Were the best fed; were the best clothed, with a better distribution of this worlds goods to all of our people than any people in history. Now, in pointing out the things that are wrong, I think we ought to emphasize Americas strengths. It isnt necessary to  to run America down in order to build her up. Now so that we get it absolutely clear: Senator Kennedy must as a candidate  as I as a candidate in fifty-two  criticize us when were wrong. And hes doing a very effective job of that, in his way. But on the other hand, he has a responsibility to be accurate. And I have a responsibility to correct him every time he misstates the case; and I intend to continue to do so.",1960-10-07,Republican
Mr. Mcgee,Senator Kennedy.,1960-10-07,Moderator
Mr. Kennedy,"Well, Mr. Nixon uh- Ill just give you the testimony of Mr. George Aiken  Senator George Aiken, the ranking minority member  Republican member  and former chairman of the Senate Agricultural Committee testifying in 1959  said there were twenty-six million Americans who did not have the income to afford a decent diet. Mr. Benson, testifying on the food stamp plan in 1957, said there were twenty-five million Americans who could not afford a elementary low-cost diet. And he defined that as someone who uses beans in place of meat. Now Ive seen a good many hundreds of thousands of people who are uh  not adequately fed. You cant tell me that a surplus food distribution of five cents po- per person  and that n- nearly six million Americans receiving that  is adequate. You cant tell me that any one who uses beans instead of meat in the United States  and there are twenty-five million of them according to Mr. Benson  is well fed or adequately fed. I believe that we should not compare what our figures may be to India or some other country that has serious problems but to remember that we are the most prosperous country in the world and that these people are not getting adequate food. And theyre not getting in many cases adequate shelter. And we ought to try to meet the problem. Secondly, Mr. Nixon has continued to state  and he stated it last week  these fantastic figures of what the Democratic budget would c- uh  platform would cost. Theyre wholly inaccurate. I said last week I believed in a balanced budget. Unless there was a severe recession  and after all the worst unbalanced budget in history was in 1958, twelve billion dollars  larger than in any Administration in the history of the United States. So that I believe that on this subject we can balance the budget unless we have a national emergency or unless we have a severe recession.",1960-10-07,Democrat
Mr. Mcgee,Mr. Morgan with a question for Senator Kennedy.,1960-10-07,Moderator
Mr. Morgan,"Senator, Saturday on television you said that you had always thought that Quemoy and Matsu were unwise places to draw our defense line in the Far East. Would you comment further on that and also address to this question; couldnt a pullback from those islands be interpreted as appeasement?",1960-10-07,Moderator
Mr. Kennedy,"Well, the United States uh  has on occasion attempted uh  mostly in the middle fifties, to persuade Chiang Kai-shek to pull his troops back to Formosa. I believe strongly in the defense of Formosa. These islands are a few miles  five or six miles  off the coast of Red China, within a general harbor area and more than a hundred miles from Formosa. We have never said flatly that we will defend Quemoy and Matsu if its attacked. We say we will defend it if its part of a general attack on Formosa. But its extremely difficult to make that judgment. Now, Mr. Herter in 1958, when he was Under Secretary of State, said they were strategically undefensible. Admirals Spruance and Callins in 1955 said that we should not attempt to defend these islands, in their conference in the Far East. General Ridgway has said the same thing. I believe that when you get into a w- if youre going to get into war for the defense of Formosa, it ought to be on a clearly defined line. One of the problems, I think, at the time of South Korea was the question of whether the United States would defend it if it were attacked. I believe that we should defend Formosa. We should come to its defense. To leave this rather in the air, that we will defend it under some conditions but not under other, I think is a mistake. Secondly, I would not suggest the withdrawal at the point of the Communist gun. It is a decision finally that the Nationalists should make and I believe that we should consult with them and attempt to work out a plan by which the line is drawn at the island of Formosa. It leaves a hundred miles between the sea. But with General Ridgway, Mr. Herter, General Collins, Admiral Spruance and many others, I think its unwise to take the chance of being dragged into a war which may lead to a world war over two islands which are not strategically defensible, which are not, according to their testimony, essential to the defense of Formosa. I think that uh  we should protect our commitments. I believe strongly we should do so in Berlin. I believe strongly we should d- do so in Formosa and I believe we should meet our commitments to every country whose security weve guaranteed. But I do not believe that that line in case of war should be drawn on those islands but instead on the island of Formosa. And as long as they are not essential to the defense of Formosa, its been my judgment ever since 1954, at the time of the Eisenhower Doctrine for the Far East, that our line should be drawn in the sea around the island itself.",1960-10-07,Democrat
Mr. Mcgee,Mr. Vice President.,1960-10-07,Moderator
Mr. Nixon,"I disagree completely with Senator Kennedy on this point. I remember in the period immediately before the Korean War, South Korea was supposed to be indefensible as well. Generals testified to that. And Secretary Acheson made a very famous speech at the Press Club, early in the year that k- Korean War started, indicating in effect that South Korea was beyond the defense zone of the United States. I suppose it was hoped when he made that speech that we wouldnt get into a war. But it didnt mean that. We had to go in when they came in. Now I think as far as Quemoy and Matsu are concerned, that the question is not these two little pieces of real estate  they are unimportant. It isnt the few people who live on them  they are not too important. Its the principle involved. These two islands are in the area of freedom. The Nationalists have these two islands. We should not uh  force our Nationalist allies to get off of them and give them to the Communists. If we do that we start a chain reaction; because the Communists arent after Quemoy and Matsu, theyre a- theyre after Formosa. In my opinion this is the same kind of woolly thinking that led to disaster for America in Korea. I am against it. I would never tolerate it as president of the United States, and I will hope that Senator Kennedy will change his mind if he should be elected.",1960-10-07,Republican
Mr. Mcgee,"Gentlemen, we have approximately four minutes remaining. May I ask you to make your questions and answers as brief as possible consistent with clarity. And Mr. Levy has a question for Vice President Nixon.",1960-10-07,Moderator
Mr. Levy,"Mr. Vice President, you are urging voters to forget party labels and vote for the man. Senator Kennedy says that in doing this you are trying to run away from your party on such issues as housing and aid to education by advocating what he calls a me-too program. Why do you say that party labels are not important? MR. NIXON; Because thats the way we elect a president in this country, and its the way we should. Im a student of history as is Senator Kennedy, incidentally; and I have found that in the history of this country weve had many great presidents. Some of them have been Democrats and some of them have been Republicans. The people, some way, have always understood that at a particular time a certain man was the one the country needed. Now, I believe that in an election when we are trying to determine who should lead the free world  not just America  perhaps, as Senator Kennedy has already indicated, the most important election in our history  it isnt the label that he wears or that I wear that counts. Its what we are. Its our whole lives. Its what we stand for. Its what we believe. And consequently, I dont think its enough to go before Republican audiences  and I never do  and say, Look, vote for me because Im a Republican. I dont think its enough for Senator Kennedy to go before the audiences on the Democratic side and say, Vote for me because Im a Democrat. That isnt enough. Whats involved here is the question of leadership for the whole free world. Now that means the best leadership. It may be Republican, it may be Democratic. But the people are the ones that determine it. The people have to make up their minds. And I believe the people, therefore, should be asked to make up their minds not simply on the basis of, Vote the way your grandfather did; vote the way your mother did. I think the people should put America first, rather than party first. Now, as far as running away from my party is concerned, Senator Kennedy has said that we have no compassion for the poor, that we are against progress  the enemies of progress, is the term that hes used, and the like. All that I can say is this: we do have programs in all of these fields  education, housing, defense  that will move America forward. They will move her forward faster, and they will move her more surely than in his program. This is what I deeply believe. Im sure he believes just as deeply that his will move that way. I suggest, however, that in the interest of fairness that he could give me the benefit of also believing as he believes.",1960-10-07,Moderator
Mr. Mcgee,Senator Kennedy.,1960-10-07,Moderator
Mr. Kennedy,"Well, let me say I do think that parties are important in that they tell something about the program and something about the man. Abraham Lincoln was a great president of all the people; but he was selected by his party at a key time in history because his party stood for something. The Democratic party in this century has stood for something. It has stood for progress; it has stood for concern for the peoples welfare. It has stood for a strong foreign policy and a strong national defense, and as a result, produced Wilson, President Roosevelt, and President Truman. The Republican party has produced McKinley and Harding, Coolidge, Dewey, and Landon. They do stand for something. They stand for a whole different approach to the problems facing this country at home and abroad. Thats the importance of party; only if it tells something about the record. And the Republicans in recent years  not only in the last twenty-five years, but in the last eight years  have opposed housing, opposed care for the aged, opposed federal aid to education, opposed minimum wage and I think that record tells something.",1960-10-07,Democrat

Im Gwen Ifill of The NewsHour and Washington Week on PBS, and I welcome you to the first and the only vice presidential debate between Vice President Dick Cheney, the Republican nominee, and Senator John Edwards, the Democratic nominee. These debates are sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates. Tonights will last 90 minutes, following detailed rules of engagement worked out by representatives of the candidates. I have agreed to enforce the rules they have devised for themselves to the best of my ability. The questions tonight will be divided between foreign and domestic policy, but the specific topics were chosen by me. The candidates have not been told what they are.",2004-10-05,Moderator
Cheney,"Gwen, I want to thank you, and I want to thank the folks here at Case Western Reserve for hosting this tonight. Its a very important event, and theyve done a superb job of putting it together. Its important to look at all of our developments in Iraq within the broader context of the global war on terror. And, after 9/11, it became clear that we had to do several things to have a successful strategy to win the global war on terror, specifically that we had to go after the terrorists wherever we might find them, that we also had to go after state sponsors of terror, those who might provide sanctuary or safe harbor for terror. And we also then finally had to stand up democracies in their stead afterwards, because that was the only way to guarantee that these states would not again become safe harbors for terror or for the development of deadly weapons. Concern about Iraq specifically focused on the fact that Saddam Hussein had been, for years, listed on the state sponsor of terror, that they he had established relationships with Abu Nidal, who operated out of Baghdad; he paid $25,000 to the families of suicide bombers; and he had an established relationship with Al Qaida. Specifically, look at George Tenet, the CIA directors testimony before the Committee on Foreign Relations two years ago when he talked about a 10-year relationship. The effort that weve mounted with respect to Iraq focused specifically on the possibility that this was the most likely nexus between the terrorists and weapons of mass destruction. The biggest threat we faced today is the possibility of terrorists smuggling a nuclear weapon or a biological agent into one of our own cities and threatening the lives of hundreds of thousands of Americans. What we did in Iraq was exactly the right thing to do. If I had it to recommend all over again, I would recommend exactly the same course of action. The world is far safer today because Saddam Hussein is in jail, his government is no longer in power. And we did exactly the right thing.",2004-10-05,Republican

Edwards,"Thank you. Thank you, Gwen, for moderating this debate. Thank you to the folks of Case Western and all the people in Ohio for having us here. Mr. Vice President, you are still not being straight with the American people. I mean, the reality you and George Bush continue to tell people, first, that things are going well in Iraq  the American people dont need us to explain this to them, they see it on their television every single day. We lost more troops in September than we lost in August; lost more in August than we lost in July; lost more in July than we lost in June. The truth is, our men and women in uniform have been heroic. Our military has done everything theyve been asked to do. And its not just me that sees the mess in Iraq. There are Republican leaders, like John McCain, like Richard Lugar, like Chuck Hagel, who have said Iraq is a mess and its getting worse. And when they were asked why, Richard Lugar said because of the incompetence of the administration. What Paul Bremer said yesterday is they didnt have enough troops to secure the country. They also didnt have a plan to win the peace. They also didnt put the alliances together to make this successful. We need a fresh start. We need a president who will speed up the training of the Iraqis, get more staff in for doing that. We need to speed up the reconstruction so the Iraqis see some tangible benefit. We need a new president who has the credibility, which John Kerry has, to bring others into this effort.",2004-10-05,Democrat
Ifill,"You have 30 seconds to respond, Mr. Vice President.",2004-10-05,Moderator
Cheney,"Weve made significant progress in Iraq. Weve stood up a new government thats been in power now only 90 days. The notion of additional troops is talked about frequently, but the point of success in Iraq will be reached when we have turned governance over to the Iraqi people; they have been able to establish a democratic government. Theyre well on their way to doing that. They will have free elections next January for the first time in history. We also are actively, rapidly training Iraqis to take on the security responsibility. Those two steps are crucial to success in Iraq. Theyre well in hand, well under way. And Im confident that, in fact, well get the job done.",2004-10-05,Republican
Ifill,"You have 30 seconds, Senator.",2004-10-05,Moderator
Edwards,"Yes. Mr. Vice President, there is no connection between the attacks of September 11th and Saddam Hussein. The 9/11 Commission has said it. Your own secretary of state has said it. And youve gone around the country suggesting that there is some connection. There is not. And in fact the CIA is now about to report that the connection between Al Qaida and Saddam Hussein is tenuous at best. And, in fact, the secretary of defense said yesterday that he knows of no hard evidence of the connection. We need to be straight with the American people.",2004-10-05,Democrat
Ifill,"Time for a new question but the same topic. And this time to you, Senator Edwards. You and Senator Kerry have said that the war in Iraq is the wrong war at the wrong time.",2004-10-05,Moderator
Edwards,"Heres what it means: It means that Saddam Hussein needed to be confronted. John Kerry and I have consistently said that. Thats why we voted for the resolution. But it also means it needed to be done the right way. And doing it the right way meant that we were prepared; that we gave the weapons inspectors time to find out what we now know, that in fact there were no weapons of mass destruction; that we didnt take our eye off the ball, which are Al Qaida, Osama bin Laden, the people who attacked us on September the 11th. Now, remember, we went into Afghanistan, which, by the way, was the right thing to do. That was the right decision. And our military performed terrifically there. They gave the responsibility of capturing and/or killing Saddam  I mean Osama bin Laden to Afghan warlords who, just a few weeks before, had been working with Osama bin Laden. Our point in this is not complicated: We were attacked by Al Qaida and Osama bin Laden. We went into Afghanistan and very quickly the administration made a decision to divert attention from that and instead began to plan for the invasion of Iraq. And these connections  I want the American people to hear this very clearly. Listen carefully to what the vice president is saying. Because there is no connection between Saddam Hussein and the attacks of September 11th  period. The 9/11 Commission has said thats true. Colin Powell has said its true. But the vice president keeps suggesting that there is. There is not. And, in fact, any connection with Al Qaida is tenuous at best.",2004-10-05,Democrat
Ifill,"Mr. Vice President, you have 90 seconds to respond.",2004-10-05,Moderator
Cheney,"The senator has got his facts wrong. I have not suggested theres a connection between Iraq and 9/11, but theres clearly an established Iraqi track record with terror. And the point is that thats the place where youre most likely to see the terrorists come together with weapons of mass destruction, the deadly technologies that Saddam Hussein had developed and used over the years. Now, the fact of the matter is, the big difference here, Gwen, is they are not prepared to deal with states that sponsor terror. Theyve got a very limited view about how to use U.S. military forces to defend America. We heard Senator Kerry say the other night that there ought to be some kind of global test before U.S. troops are deployed preemptively to protect the United States. Thats part of a track record that goes back to the 1970s when he ran for Congress the first time and said troops should not be deployed without U.N. approval. Then, in the mid-80s, he ran on the basis of cutting most of our major defense programs. In 1991, he voted against Desert Storm. Its a consistent pattern over time of always being on the wrong side of defense issues. A little tough talk in the midst of a campaign or as part of a presidential debate cannot obscure a record of 30 years of being on the wrong side of defense issues. And they give absolutely no indication, based on that record, of being wiling to go forward and aggressively pursue the war on terror with a kind of strategy that will work, that will defeat our enemies and will guarantee that the United States doesnt again get attacked by the likes of Al Qaida.",2004-10-05,Republican
Ifill,"You will respond to that topic, but first I want to ask you for two minutes, Vice President Cheney. Tonight we mentioned Afghanistan. We believe that Osama bin Laden is hiding perhaps in a cave somewhere along the Afghan-Pakistan border.",2004-10-05,Moderator
Cheney,"Gwen, weve never let up on Osama bin Laden from day one. Weve actively and aggressively pursued him. Weve captured or killed thousands of Al Qaida in various places around the world and especially in Afghanistan. Well continue to very aggressively pursue him, and Im confident eventually well get him. The key to success in Afghanistan has been, again, to go in and go after the terrorists, which weve done, and also take down the Taliban regime which allowed them to function there, in effect sponsors, if you will, of the Al Qaida organization. John Edwards, two and a half years ago, six months after we went into Afghanistan announced that it was chaotic, the situation was deteriorating, the warlords were about to take over. Here we are, two and a half years later, were four days away from a democratic election, the first one in history in Afghanistan. Weve got 10 million voters who have registered to vote, nearly half of them women. That election will put in place a democratically elected government that will take over next December. Weve made enormous progress in Afghanistan, in exactly the right direction, in spite of what John Edwards said two and a half years ago. He just got it wrong. The fact is, as we go forward in Afghanistan, we will pursue Osama bin Laden and the terrorists as long as necessary. Were standing up Afghan security forces so they can take on responsibility for their own security. Well keep U.S. forces there  we have about 16,000 there today  as long as necessary, to assist the Afghans in terms of dealing with their security situation. But theyre making significant progress. We have President Karzai, who is in power. They have done wonders writing their own constitution for the first time ever. Schools are open. Young girls are going to school. Women are going to vote. Women are even eligible to run for office. This is major, major progress. There will be democracy in Afghanistan, make no doubt about it. Freedom is the best antidote to terror.",2004-10-05,Republican
Ifill,"Senator Edwards, you have 90 seconds.",2004-10-05,Moderator
Edwards,"Someone did get it wrong. But it wasnt John Kerry and John Edwards. They got it wrong. When we had Osama bin Laden cornered, they left the job to the Afghan warlords. They then diverted their attention from the very people who attacked us, who were at the center of the war on terror, and so Osama bin Laden is still at large. Now, I want to go back to something the vice president said just a minute ago, because these distortions are continuing. He said that  made mention of this global test. What John Kerry said  and its just as clear as day to anybody who was listening  he said: We will find terrorists where they are and kill them before they ever do harm to the American people, first. We will keep this country safe. He defended this country as a young man, he will defend this country as president of the United States. He also said very clearly that he will never give any country veto power over the security of the United States of America. Now, I know the vice president would like to pretend that wasnt said, and the president would too. But the reality is it was said. Heres whats actually happened in Afghanistan, regardless of this rosy scenario that they paint on Afghanistan, just like they do with Iraq. Whats actually happened is theyre now providing 75 percent of the worlds opium. Not only are they providing 75 percent of the worlds opium, large-cut parts of the country are under the control of drug lords and warlords. Big parts of the country are still insecure. And the reality is the part of Afghanistan, eastern Afghanistan, where Osama bin Laden is, is one of the hardest places to control and the most insecure, Gwen.",2004-10-05,Democrat

And the terrorists would come in and shoot up polling places; as soon as they left, the voters would come back and get in line and would not be denied the right to vote.

Ifill," I want people to understand exactly what it is, as you said, that Senator Kerry did say.",2004-10-05,Moderator
Edwards,"Well, let me say, first, he said in the same segment  I dont remember precisely where it was connected with what you just read  but he said, point blank, We will never give anyone a veto over the security of the United States of America. What hes saying is were going to go back to the proud tradition of the United States of America and presidents of the United States of America for the last 50 to 75 years. First, were going to actually tell the American people the truth. Were going to tell them the truth about whats happening. Were not going to suggest to them that things are going well in Iraq or anyplace else when, in fact, theyre not. Were going to make sure that the American people know the truth about why we are using force and what the explanation for it is. And its not just the American people. Were also going to make sure that we tell the world the truth. Because the reality is, for America to lead, for America to do what its done for 50 years before this president and vice president came into office, it is critical that we be credible. It is critical that they believe that when America takes action, they can trust what were doing, what we say, what we say at the United Nations, what we say in direct conversations with leaders of the world  of other countries. They need to know that the credibility of the United States is always good, because they will not follow us without that. And unfortunately, were seeing the consequences of that right now. Its one of the reasons that were having so much difficulty getting others involved in the effort in Iraq. You know, weve taken 90 percent of the coalition casualties. American taxpayers have borne 90 percent of the costs of the effort in Iraq. And we see the result of there not being a coalition: The first Gulf war cost America $5 billion. Were at $200 billion and counting. John Kerry will never give up control over the security of the United States of America to any other country. We will not outsource our responsibility to keep this country safe.",2004-10-05,Democrat
Ifill,"Mr. Vice President, you have 90 seconds to respond.",2004-10-05,Moderator
Cheney,"Well, Gwen, the 90 percent figure is just dead wrong. When you include the Iraqi security forces that have suffered casualties, as well as the allies, theyve taken almost 50 percent of the casualties in operations in Iraq, which leaves the U.S. with 50 percent, not 90 percent. With respect to the cost, it wasnt $200 billion. You probably werent there to vote for that. But $120 billion is, in fact, what has been allocated to Iraq. The rest of its for Afghanistan and the global war on terror. The allies have stepped forward and agreed to reduce and forgive Iraqi debt to the tune of nearly $80 billion by one estimate. That, plus $14 billion they promised in terms of direct aid, puts the overall allied contribution financially at about $95 billion, not to the $120 billion weve got, but, you know, better than 40 percent. So your facts are just wrong, Senator. You also have a situation where you talk about credibility. Its awfully hard to convey a sense of credibility to allies when you voted for the war and then you declared: Wrong war, wrong place, wrong time. You voted for the war, and then you voted against supporting the troops when they needed the equipment, the fuel, the spare parts and the ammunition and the body armor. Youre not credible on Iraq because of the enormous inconsistencies that John Kerry and you have cited time after time after time during the course of the campaign. Whatever the political pressures of the moment requires, thats where youre at. But youve not been consistent, and theres no indication at all that John Kerry has the conviction to successfully carry through on the war on terror.",2004-10-05,Republican
Edwards,"May I respond briefly? What the vice president has just said is just a complete distortion. The American people saw John Kerry on Thursday night. They dont need the vice president or the president to tell them what they saw. They saw a man who was strong, who had conviction, who is resolute, who made it very clear that he will do everything that has to be done to find terrorists, to keep the American people safe. He laid out his plan for success in Iraq, made it clear that we were committed to success in Iraq. We have to be, because we have troops on the ground there and because they have created a haven for terrorists.",2004-10-05,Democrat

And you cannot use talk tough during the course of a 90-minute debate in a presidential campaign to obscure a 30-year record in the United States Senate and, prior to that by John Kerry, who has consistently come down on the wrong side of all the major defense issues that hes faced as a public official.",2004-10-05,Republican
Ifill,"Mr. Vice President, a new question for you. You have two minutes to respond.",2004-10-05,Moderator
Cheney,"Im saying specifically that I dont believe he has the qualities we need in a commander in chief because I dont think, based on his record, that he would pursue the kind of aggressive policies that need to be pursued if were going to defeat these terrorists. We need to battle them overseas so we dont have to battle them here at home. Im not challenging John Kerrys patriotism. I said in my acceptance speech in New York City at the Republican convention that we respected his service in Vietnam, and I got applause for that. Weve never criticized his patriotism. What weve questioned is his judgment. And his judgments flawed, and the records there for anybody who wants to look at it. In 1984, when he ran for the Senate he opposed, or called for the elimination of a great many major weapons systems that were crucial to winning the Cold War and are important today to our overall forces. When Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait and occupied it in 1990 and 91, he stood up on the floor of the Senate and voted against going in to liberate Kuwait and push Saddam Hussein back to Iraq. The problem we have is that, if you look at his record, he doesnt display the qualities of somebody who has conviction. And with respect to this particular operation, weve seen a situation in which, first, they voted to commit the troops, to send them to war, John Edwards and John Kerry, then they came back and when the question was whether or not you provide them with the resources they needed  body armor, spare parts, ammunition  they voted against it. I couldnt figure out why that happened initially. And then I looked and figured out that what was happening was Howard Dean was making major progress in the Democratic primaries, running away with the primaries based on an anti-war record. So they, in effect, decided they would cast an anti-war vote and they voted against the troops.",2004-10-05,Republican

I want to go back to what the vice president just said, because its a continuation of the things hes been doing, unfortunately, on the campaign trail; its a continuation of what he began his first answer with tonight. John Kerry has voted for the biggest military appropriations bill in the countrys history. John Kerry has voted for the biggest intelligence appropriations in the countrys history. This vice president, when he was secretary of defense, cut over 80 weapons systems, including the very ones hes criticizing John Kerry for voting against. These are weapons systems, a big chunk of which, the vice president himself suggested we get rid of after the Cold War. The reality is that John Kerry has consistently supported the very men that he served with in Vietnam and led. On the $87 billion, it was clear at the time of that vote that they had no plan to win the peace. Were seeing the consequences of that everyday on the ground right now. We stood up and said: For our troops, we must have a plan to win the peace. We also thought it was wrong to have a $20 billion fund out of which $7.5 billion was going to go to a no-bid contract for Halliburton, the vice presidents former company. It was wrong then. Its wrong now.",2004-10-05,Democrat

We have not seen the kind of consistency that a commander in chief has to have in order to be a leader in wartime and in order to be able to see the strategy through to victory. If we want to win the war on terror, it seems to me its pretty clear the choice is George Bush, not John Kerry.",2004-10-05,Republican

Had they had time to do their job, they would have discovered what we now know, that in fact Saddam Hussein had no weapons, that in fact Saddam Hussein has no connection with 9/11, that in fact Saddam Hussein has little or no connection with Al Qaida.",2004-10-05,Democrat
Ifill,"Senator Edwards, new question to you, and you have two minutes to respond. Part of what you have said and Senator Kerry has said that you are going to do in order to get us out of the problems in Iraq is to internationalize the effort.",2004-10-05,Moderator
Edwards,"Well, lets start with what we know. What we know is that the president and the vice president have not done the work to build the coalition that we need  dramatically different than the first Gulf War. We know that they havent done it, and we know they cant do it. They didnt, by the way, just reject the allies going into lead- up to the war. They also rejected them in the effort to do the reconstruction in Iraq, and that has consequences. What we believe is, as part of our entire plan for Iraq  and we have a plan for Iraq. They have a plan for Iraq too: more of the same. We have a plan for success. And that plan includes speeding up the training of the military. We have less than half of the staff that we need there to complete that training. Second, make sure that the reconstruction is sped up in a way that the Iraqis see some tangible benefit for whats happening. And by the way, if we need to, we can take Iraqis out of Iraq to train them. It is not secure enough. Its so dangerous on the ground that they cant be trained there. We can take them out of Iraq for purposes of training. We should do whatever has to be done to train the Iraqis and to speed up that process. That works in conjunction with making sure the elections take place on time. Right now, the United Nations, which is responsible for the elections in January, has about 35 people there. Now, thats compared with a much smaller country like East Timor, where they had over 200 people on the ground. You need more than 35 people to hold an election in Cleveland, much less in Iraq. And they keep saying the elections on schedule, this is going to happen. The reality is we need a new president with credibility with the rest of the world and who has a real plan for success. Success breeds contribution, breeds joining the coalition. Not only that, I want to go back to what the vice president said. He attacks us about the troops. They sent 40,000 American troops into Iraq without the body armor they needed. They sent them without the armored vehicles they needed. While they were on the ground fighting, they lobbied the Congress to cut their combat pay. This is the height of hypocrisy.",2004-10-05,Democrat
Ifill,"Mr. Vice President, you have 90 seconds.",2004-10-05,Moderator
Cheney,"Well, Gwen, its hard to know where to start; there are so many inaccuracies there. The fact of the matter is the troops wouldnt have what they have today if you guys had had your way. You talk about internationalizing the effort. They dont have a plan. Basically, its an echo. You made the comment that the Gulf War coalition in 91 was far stronger than this. No. We had 34 countries then; weve got 30 today. Weve got troops beside us. Its hard, after John Kerry referred to our allies as a coalition of the coerced and the bribed, to go out and persuade people to send troops and to participate in this process. You end up with a situation in which  talk about demeaning. In effect, you demean the sacrifice of our allies when you say its the wrong war, wrong place, wrong time, and oh, by the way, send troops. Makes no sense at all. Its totally inconsistent. There isnt a plan there. Our most important ally in the war on terror, in Iraq specifically, is Prime Minister Allawi. He came recently and addressed a joint session of Congress that I presided over with the speaker of the House. And John Kerry rushed out immediately after his speech was over with, where he came and he thanked America for our contributions and our sacrifice and pledged to hold those elections in January, went out and demeaned him, criticized him, challenged his credibility. That is not the way to win friends and allies. Youre never going to add to the coalition with that kind of attitude. IFILL: Senator Edwards, 30 seconds.",2004-10-05,Republican
Edwards,"Thank you. The vice president suggests that we have the same number of countries involved now that we had in the first Gulf War. The first Gulf War cost the American people $5 billion. And regardless of what the vice president says, were at $200 billion and counting.

Ifill,Its a question of American intelligence.,2004-10-05,Moderator
Edwards,"Well, let me speak, first of all, to what the vice president just said, and then Ill answer that question. This, unfortunately  what the vice president is telling people is inconsistent with everything they see every single day. Its a continuation of, Well, theres a strong connection between Al Qaida and Saddam Hussein. Its not true. Its a continuation of at least insinuating that theres some connection between 9/11 and Saddam Hussein. Its not true. Its saying to the American people, as the president said last Thursday, and the vice president continues to say tonight, that things are going well in Iraq, contrary to what people who have been there have seen, including Republican leaders, contrary to what everyone in America sees on their television every day  Americans being kidnapped, people being beheaded, parts of the country under the control of insurgents, even today, under the control of the insurgents. The vice president has still not said anything about what Mr. Bremer said, about the failure to have adequate troops, the failure to be able to secure the country in the short term. Look at where we are now. It is a direct result of the failure to plan, the failure to have others involved in this effort. This is not an accident. Now, let me go back to your question. If we want to do the things that need to be done to keep this country safe, we cant be dragged kicking and screaming to it. One thing that everybody does agree on is that 9/11 did change things. But whats happened is this administration opposed the creation of a 9/11 Commission to find out why it happened and what we needed to do. They opposed the creation of a Department of Homeland Security, and then they were for it. We cant react that way. We must be more aggressive. With John Kerry as president of the United States, we are committed to immediately implementing all of the reforms suggested by the 9/11 Commission, so that we have the information we need to find terrorists and crush them before they hurt us.",2004-10-05,Democrat
Ifill,"Mr. Vice President? CHENEY: Gwen, the story that appeared today about this report is one I asked for. I ask an awful lot of questions as part of my job as vice president. A CIA spokesman was quoted in that story as saying they had not yet reached the bottom line and there is still debate over this question of the relationship between Zarqawi and Saddam Hussein. But lets look at what we know about Mr. Zarqawi. We know he was running a terrorist camp, training terrorists in Afghanistan prior to 9/11. We know that when we went into Afghanistan that he then migrated to Baghdad. He set up shop in Baghdad, where he oversaw the poisons facility up at Khurmal (ph), where the terrorists were developing ricin and other deadly substances to use. We know hes still in Baghdad today. He is responsible for most of the major car bombings that have killed or maimed thousands of people. Hes the one you will see on the evening news beheading hostages. He is, without question, a bad guy. He is, without question, a terrorist. He was, in fact, in Baghdad before the war, and hes in Baghdad now after the war. The fact of the matter is that this is exactly the kind of track record weve seen over the years. We have to deal with Zarqawi by taking him out, and thats exactly what well do.",2004-10-05,Moderator

Cheney,"No, I do not. And, Gwen, at the time, I was talking specifically about this question of unilateral sanctions. What happens when we impose unilateral sanctions is, unless theres a collective effort, then other people move in and take advantage of the situation and you dont have any impact, except to penalize American companies. Weve got sanctions on Iran now. We may well want to go to the U.N. Security Council and ask for even tougher sanctions if they dont live up to their obligations under the initial  International Atomic Energy Agency Non-Proliferation Treaty. We dealt with Iran differently than we have Iraq partly because Iran has not yet, as Iraq did, violated 12 years of resolutions by the U.N. Security Council. Were working with the Brits and the Germans and the French, whove been negotiating with the Iranians. We recently were actively involved in a meeting with the board of governors in the International Atomic Energy Agency. And as I say, there will be a follow-up meeting in November to determine whether or not Irans living up to their commitments and obligations. And if they arent, my guess is then the board of governors will recommend sending the whole matter to the U.N. Security Council for the application of the international sanctions, which I think would be exactly the right way to go. Were addressing North Korea on a similar basis, working with the Chinese, the South Koreans, the Japanese and others to try to bring them around. One of the great by-products, for example, of what we did in Iraq and Afghanistan is that five days after we captured Saddam Hussein, Moammar Gadhafi in Libya came forward and announced that he was going to surrender all of his nuclear materials to the United States, which he has done. This was one of the biggest sources of proliferation in the world today in terms of the threat that was represented by that. The suppliers network that provided that, headed by Mr. A.Q. Khan, has been shut down. Weve made major progress in dealing here with a major issue with respect to nuclear proliferation. And well continue to press very hard on the North Koreans and the Iranians as well.",2004-10-05,Republican

They ceded responsibility to dealing with it to the Europeans. Now, the vice president, as you pointed out, spoke out loudly for lifting the sanctions on Iraq. John Kerry and I believe we need to strengthen the sanctions on Iraq, including closing the loophole that allows companies to use a subsidiary, offshore subsidiaries to do business with Iran. I mentioned Halliburton a few minute ago in connection with the $87 billion, and you raised it in this question. This is relevant, because he was pushing for lifting sanctions when he was CEO of Halliburton. Heres why we didnt think Halliburton should have a no-bid contract. While he was CEO of Halliburton, they paid millions of dollars in fines for providing false information on their company, just like Enron and Ken Lay. They did business with Libya and Iran, two sworn enemies of the United States. Theyre now under investigation for having bribed foreign officials during that period of time. Not only that, theyve gotten a $7.5 billion no-bid contract in Iraq, and instead of part of their money being withheld, which is the way its normally done, because theyre under investigation, theyve continued to get their money.",2004-10-05,Democrat

First of all, do you agree that the United States is absent? Maybe you dont.",2004-10-05,Moderator
Edwards,"Well, first of all, I do agree that weve been largely absent, not entirely absent, but largely absent from the peace-making process over the last four years. And let me just say a couple of preliminary things and then talk about where we are now. First, the Israeli people not only have the right to defend themselves, they should defend themselves. They have an obligation to defend themselves. I mean, if I can, just for a moment, tell you a personal story. I was in Jerusalem a couple of years ago, actually three years ago, in August of 2001, staying at the King David Hotel. We left in the morning, headed to the airport to leave, and later in the day I found out that that same day, not far from where we were staying, the Sbarro Pizzeria was hit by a suicide bomber in Jerusalem. Fifteen people were killed. Six children were killed. They have not only the right but the obligation to defend themselves. Now, we know that the prime minister has made a decision, a historic decision, to unilaterally withdraw from Gaza. Its important for America to participate in helping with that process. Now, if Gazas being used as a platform for attacking the Israeli people, that has to be stopped. And Israel has a right to defend itself. They dont have a partner for peace right now. They certainly dont have a partner in Arafat, and they need a legitimate partner for peace. And I might add, it is very important for America to crack down on the Saudis who have not had a public prosecution for financing terrorism since 9/11. And its important for America to confront the situation in Iran, because Iran is an enormous threat to Israel and to the Israeli people.",2004-10-05,Democrat

In respect to Israel and Palestine, Gwen, the suicide bombers, in part, were generated by Saddam Hussein, who paid $25,000 to the families of suicide bombers. I personally think one of the reasons that we dont have as many suicide attacks today in Israel as weve had in the past is because Saddam is no longer in business. Weve been strong supporters of Israel. The president stepped forward and put in place a policy basically that said we will support the establishment of two states. First president ever to say well establish and support a Palestinian state nextdoor to Israelis. But first, there has to be an interlocutor you can trust and deal with.

Weve, of course, been through a difficult recession, and then the aftermath of 9/11, where we lost over a million jobs after that attack. But we think the key is to address some basic, fundamental issues that the presidents already working on. I think probably the most successful thing we can do with respect to ending poverty is to get people jobs. Theres no better antidote to poverty than a good, well-paying job that allows somebody to take care of their own family. To do that, we have to make America the best place in the world to do business. And that means weve got to deal effectively with tax policy. Weve got to reduce the litigation costs that are built into our society. Weve got to provide the adequate medical care and make certain that we can, in fact, create the opportunities that are vital to that process. Id zero in, in particular, on education. I think the most important thing we can do is have a first-class public school system. Im a product of public schools. And the president, his first legislative priority was the No Child Left Behind Act. It was the first piece of legislation we introduced. We got it passed that first summer on a bipartisan basis. We even had Ted Kennedy on board for the effort. And it does several things. It establishes high standards. It, at the same time, sets up a system of testing with respect to our school system, so we can establish accountability to parents and make certain that they understand how well their students are doing. And they have the opportunity to move students out of poorly performing schools to good schools. It strikes me that that is absolutely the heart of what needs to be done from the standpoint of education. Its also important, as we go forward in the next term, we want to be able to take what weve done for elementary education and move it into the secondary education. Its working. Weve seen reports now of a reduction in the achievement gap between majority students and minority students. Were making significant progress.",2004-10-05,Republican

And its had real consequences in places like Cleveland. Cleveland is a wonderful, distinguished city thats done a lot of great things, but it has the highest poverty rate in the country. One out of almost two children in Cleveland are now living in poverty.

The Washington Post just reported they have several trillion dollars of additional tax cuts and spending, no suggestion of what theyre going to do about it. John Kerry and I believe we have a moral responsibility not to leave trillions of debt to our children and our grandchildren. So heres what were going to do, to answer your question. To pay for the things that we believe need to be done  and I hope to get the chance to talk about health care and also about education, because we have plans on both of those subjects  what were going to do is roll back tax cuts. And I want everyone to hear this, because there have been exaggerations made on the campaign trail: Roll back tax cuts for people who make over $200,000 a year; we will do that. We want to keep the tax cuts that are in place for people who make less than $200,000 a year and give additional tax cuts to those middle-class families, tax cuts for health care, tax cuts to help families pay for their college tuition, tax cuts for child care. These families are struggling and hurting, and they need more tax relief, not less tax relief. But to help get us back on the path to a balanced budget, we also want to get rid of some of the bureaucratic spending in Washington. One of the amazing things thats happened is theyve actually layered on more supervisory people, people at the supervisory level, in this government. We also want to close some corporate loopholes. Now, I want to be honest with people. We cant eliminate this deficit. People have heard that over and over and over in four years. We cannot do it. Were in too deep a hole. But we can cut the deficit in half. And if we move, we can move this country back on a path to fiscal responsibility.",2004-10-05,Democrat

Cheney,"Gwen, the Kerry record on taxes is one basically of voting for a large number of tax increases  98 times in the United States Senate. Theres a fundamental philosophical difference here between the president and myself, who believe that we ought to let the American people keep more of what they earn and we ought to empower them to have more control over their own lives  I think the Kerry-Edwards approach basically is to raise taxes and to give government more control over the lives of individual citizens. We think thats the wrong way to go. Theres a fundamental difference of opinion here. They talk about the top bracket and going after only those people in the top bracket. Well, the fact of the matter is a great many of our small businesses pay taxes under the personal income taxes rather than the corporate rate. And about 900,000 small businesses will be hit if you do, in fact, do what they want to do with the top bracket. Thats not smart because seven out of 10 new jobs in America are created by small businesses. You do not want to tax them. Its a bad idea to increase the burden on those folks. The senator himself said, during the course of the primaries, that the Kerry plan would drive us deeper into deficit. Those were the senators words about his running-mate. The fact of the matter is, the president and I will go forward to make the tax cuts permanent. Thats good policy. Thats what we ought to do. But with fiscal restraint, well also drive the deficit down 50 percent in the course of the next five years.",2004-10-05,Republican

We are for more tax cuts for the middle class than theyre for, have been for the last four years. But we are not for more tax cuts for multimillionaires. They are.

Cheney,"Gwen, youre right, four years ago in this debate, the subject came up. And I said then and I believe today that freedom does mean freedom for everybody. People ought to be free to choose any arrangement they want. Its really no one elses business. Thats a separate question from the issue of whether or not government should sanction or approve or give some sort of authorization, if you will, to these relationships. Traditionally, thats been an issue for the states. States have regulated marriage, if you will. That would be my preference. In effect, whats happened is that in recent months, especially in Massachusetts, but also in California, but in Massachusetts we had the Massachusetts Supreme Court direct the state of  the legislature of Massachusetts to modify their constitution to allow gay marriage. And the fact is that the president felt that it was important to make it clear that thats the wrong way to go, as far as hes concerned. Now, he sets the policy for this administration, and I support the president.",2004-10-05,Republican
Ifill,"Senator Edwards, 90 seconds.",2004-10-05,Moderator
Edwards,"Yes. Let me say first, on an issue that the vice president said in his last answer before we got to this question, talking about tax policy, the country needs to know that under what they have put in place and want to put in place, a millionaire sitting by their swimming pool, collecting their statements to see how much money theyre making, make their money from dividends, pays a lower tax rate than the men and women who are receiving paychecks for serving on the ground in Iraq. Now, they may think thats right. John Kerry and I do not. We dont just value wealth, which they do. We value work in this country. And it is a fundamental value difference between them and us. Now, as to this question, let me say first that I think the vice president and his wife love their daughter. I think they love her very much. And you cant have anything but respect for the fact that theyre willing to talk about the fact that they have a gay daughter, the fact that they embrace her. Its a wonderful thing. And there are millions of parents like that who love their children, who want their children to be happy. And I believe that marriage is between a man and a woman, and so does John Kerry. I also believe that there should be partnership benefits for gay and lesbian couples in long-term, committed relationships. But we should not use the Constitution to divide this country. No state for the last 200 years has ever had to recognize another states marriage. This is using the Constitution as a political tool, and its wrong.",2004-10-05,Democrat
Ifill,"New question, but same subject. As the vice president mentioned, John Kerry comes from the state of Massachusetts, which has taken as big a step as any state in the union to legalize gay marriage. Yet both you and Senator Kerry say you oppose it.",2004-10-05,Moderator
Edwards,"No. I think weve both said the same thing all along. We both believe that  and this goes onto the end of what I just talked about  we both believe that marriage is between a man and a woman. But we also believe that gay and lesbians and gay and lesbian couples, those who have been in long-term relationships, deserve to be treated respectfully, they deserve to have benefits. For example, a gay couple now has a very difficult time, one, visiting the other when theyre in the hospital, or, for example, if, heaven forbid, one of them were to pass away, they have trouble even arranging the funeral. I mean, those are not the kind of things that John Kerry and I believe in. I suspect the vice president himself does not believe in that. But we dont  we do believe that marriage should be between a man and a woman. And I want to go back, if I can, to the question you just asked, which is this constitutional amendment. I want to make sure people understand that the president is proposing a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage that is completely unnecessary. Under the law of this country for the last 200 years, no state has been required to recognize another states marriage. Let me just be simple about this. My state of North Carolina would not be required to recognize a marriage from Massachusetts, which you just asked about. There is absolutely no purpose in the law and in reality for this amendment. Its nothing but a political tool. And its being used in an effort to divide this country on an issue that we should not be dividing America on. We ought to be talking about issues like health care and jobs and whats happening in Iraq, not using an issue to divide this country in a way thats solely for political purposes. Its wrong.",2004-10-05,Democrat

Ifill,"Mr. Vice President? (LAUGHTER) CHENEY: First of all, Im not familiar with his cases. My concern is specifically with whats happened to our medical care system because of rising malpractice insurance rates, because we failed to adequately reform our medical liability structure. I was in New Mexico the other day and met with a group of OB/GYN docs. And they were deeply concerned because they were fearful that thered be another increase in malpractice insurance rates as a result of what they believe are frivolous lawsuits and that that would put them out of business. And one doctor indicated that her rates have gone up so much that shes now to the point where she is screening patients. She wont take high-risk patients anymore because of the danger that that will generate a lawsuit, and a lawsuit will put her out of business. This has had a devastating impact in a lot of communities. My home state of Wyoming, weve lost the top insurer of malpractice insurance in the state. The rates for a general practitioner have gone from $40,000 a year to $100,000 a year for an insurance policy. We think this has a devastating impact on the quality of health care. As I say, high risk patients dont get covered anymore. Weve lost one out of eleven OB/GYN practitioners in the country. We think it can be fixed, needs to be fixed. Now, specifically, what we need to do is cap non-economic damages, and we also think you need to limit the awards that the trial attorneys take out of all of this. Over 50 percent of the settlements go to the attorneys and for administrating overhead. We passed medical liability reform through the House of Representatives. Its been blocked in the Senate. Senator Kerrys voted 10 times against medical liability reform, and I dont believe Senator Edwards supports it, either, not the kind that would be meaningful.",2004-10-05,Moderator
Ifill,Senator Edwards?,2004-10-05,Moderator
Edwards,"Yes. Well let me say, first of all, Im proud of the work I did on behalf of kids and families against big insurance companies, big drug companies and big HMOs. We do have too many lawsuits. And the reality is theres something that we can do about it. John Kerry and I have a plan to do something about it. We want to put more responsibility on the lawyers to require, before a case, malpractice, which the vice president just spoke about, have the case reviewed by independent experts to determine if the case is serious and meritorious before it can be filed; hold the lawyers responsible for that, certify that and hold the lawyer financially responsible if they dont do it; have a three-strikes-and-youre-out rule so that a lawyer who files three of these cases without meeting this requirement loses their right to file these cases. That way we keep the cases out of the system that dont belong in the system. They talk about frivolous cases. We believe cases that dont belong in the system should never be in the system. But we dont believe that we should take away the right of people like Valerie Lakey, who was the young girl who I represented, five years old, severely injured for life, on a defective swimming pool drain cover. It turns out the company knew of 12 other children who had either been killed or severely injured by the same problem. They hid it. They didnt tell anybody. They could have fixed it with a 2-cent screw. Thats wrong. John Kerry and I are always going to stand with the Valerie Lakeys of the world, and not with the insurance companies.",2004-10-05,Democrat
Ifill,"Senator Edwards, new question to you, same topic. Do you feel personally attacked when Vice President Cheney talks about liability reform and tort reform and the president talks about having a trial lawyer on the ticket?",2004-10-05,Moderator
Edwards,"Am I personally attacked? I think the truth is that what theyre doing is talking about an issue that really doesnt have a great deal to do with whats happening with medical cost in this country, which I think is a very serious issue. And I would be the first to say that what the vice president described a few minutes ago, problems with malpractice premiums, thats true, its real. Its very real. What doctors talk about is very serious. And theyre getting squeezed from both sides. I mean, because, they have trouble getting reimbursed, first of all, for the care that they provide, you know, from the government or from health-care companies. And, on the flip side, their malpractice costs are going up. Thats very real, which is why we have proposed a plan to keep cases out of the system that dont belong there. But its very important to put this in context. Because, in context, everything theyre proposing, according to the bipartisan Congressional Budget Office, amounts to about half of 1 percent of health-care costs in this country  half of 1 percent. We have double-digit inflation in health care costs. Weve seen the largest rise in medical costs in the last four years in the countrys history: $3,500 nationally. And nobody whos watching this debate needs me to explain this to them. They know it. Medicare premiums are up 17 percent on their watch. Again, largest increase in Medicare premiums in the history of Medicare. We think we have a plan to keep cases that dont belong in the system out, but we also do what they havent done. Five million Americans have lost their health care coverage. Medical costs are skyrocketing. We have a serious health care plan to bring down costs for everybody, to cover millions more Americans and to actually stand up to drug companies and insurance companies which this administration has been unwilling to do.",2004-10-05,Democrat
Ifill,Mr. Vice President?,2004-10-05,Moderator
Cheney,"Gwen, we think lawsuit abuse is a serious problem in this country. We think we badly need tort reform. I was in Minnesota the other day, where I visited an aircraft manufacturing plant. Its a great success story. This is a company that started 20 years ago with nothing. Today theyre the second- leading producer of piston-driven aircraft in the country. He told me that if it werent for the increased cost of his liability insurance, in this case product liability, he could hire 200 more people in his factory. Weve built into the system enormous costs as a result of our practice with respect to litigation. We have to find ways to get a handle on it. He mentioned Medicare up 17 percent, somehow that that was something we caused. No. The 17 percent increase in Medicare premiums was the direct result of a statute adopted in 1997. John Kerry voted for it. It establishes the formula for Part B of Medicare that says, in effect, it has to cover 25 percent of the cost of the program. And the reason the money had to go into the trust fund was to make certain that we could cover those eligible for benefits. While you were in private practice in law and as a senator, you had the advantage of a special tax loophole, Subchapter S corporation, which you set up so you could avoid paying $600,000 in Medicare taxes that would have gone into the fund. And its those kinds of loopholes that necessitate a premium increase under the law that was enacted in 1997, supported by John Kerry.",2004-10-05,Republican

Millions of lives lost, millions more infected and facing a very bleak future. In some parts of the world, weve got the entire, sort of, productive generation has been eliminated as a result of AIDS, all except for old folks and kids  nobody to do the basic work that runs an economy. The president has been deeply concerned about it. He has moved and proposed and gotten through the Congress authorization for $15 billion to help in the international effort, to be targeted in those places where we need to do everything we can, through a combination of education as well as providing the kinds of medicines that will help people control the infection. Here in the United States, weve made significant progress. I have not heard those numbers with respect to African- American women. I was not aware that it was  that theyre in epidemic there, because we have made progress in terms of the overall rate of AIDS infection, and I think primarily through a combination of education and public awareness as well as the development, as a result of research, of drugs that allow people to live longer lives even though they are infected  obviously we need to do more of that.",2004-10-05,Republican

John Kerry and I believe that needs to be doubled. And I might add, on the first year of their commitment, they came up significantly short of what they had promised. And we probably wont get a chance to talk about Africa. Let me just say a couple of things. The AIDS epidemic in Africa, which is killing millions and millions of people and is a frightening thing not just for the people of Africa but also for the rest of the world, that, combined with the genocide that were now seeing in Sudan, are two huge moral issues for the United States of America, which John Kerry spoke about eloquently last Thursday night. Here at home we need to do much more. And the vice president spoke about doing research, making sure we have the drugs available, making sure that we do everything possible to have prevention. But its a bigger question than that. You know, we have 5 million Americans whove lost their health care coverage in the last four years; 45 million Americans without health care coverage. We have children who dont have health care coverage. If kids and adults dont have access to preventative care, if theyre not getting the health care that they need day after day after day, the possibility of not only developing AIDS and having a problem  having a problem  a life-threatening problem, but the problem of developing other life-threatening diseases is there every day of their lives.",2004-10-05,Democrat

They want to know that they have good judgment. And they want to know that youll tell them the truth. John Kerry and I will tell the American people the truth. During the time that I have served on the Intelligence Committee in the Senate, traveling to some of the places weve talked about tonight  Afghanistan, Pakistan, the Middle East, Turkey  meeting with the leaders of NATO, I have a very clear idea of what has to be done to keep this country safe. The threats we face: terrorism, killing terrorists and stopping them before they can do damage to us, making sure that we stop the spread of nuclear weapons. I agree with John Kerry from Thursday night, that the danger of nuclear weapons getting in the hands of terrorists is one of the greatest threats that America faces. But the one thing that we know from this administration is  and I  first of all, I dont claim to have the long political resume that Vice President Cheney has. Thats just the truth, and the American people know that and deserve to know it. But what we know from this administration is that a long resume does not equal good judgment. Here are the judgments I would make: My first priority would be to keep this country safe. I would find terrorists where they are and stop them and kill them before they do harm to us. We would stop the spread of nuclear weapons. And we would also strengthen this military, which means providing the equipment and training that they need. We want to raise the active-duty forces by 40,000, double the special forces so we can find terrorists where they are, and provide the kind of support for families  health care, housing  that they deserve while their loved ones are serving and protecting us.

Cheney,"I see. Well, I think the important thing in picking a vice president probably varies from president to president. Different presidents approach it in different ways. When George Bush asked me to sign on, it obviously wasnt because he was worried about carrying Wyoming. We got 70 percent of the vote in Wyoming, although those three electoral votes turned out to be pretty important last time around. What he said he wanted me to do was to sign on because of my experience to be a member of the team, to help him govern, and thats exactly the way hes used me. And I think from the perspective of the nation, its worked in our relationship, in this administration. I think its worked in part because I made it clear that I dont have any further political aspirations myself. And I think thats been an advantage. I think it allows the president to know that my only agenda is his agenda. Im not worried about what some precinct committeemen in Iowa were thinking of me with respect to the next round of caucuses of 2008. Its a very significant responsibility when you consider that at a moments notice you may have to take over as president of the United States and make all of those decisions. Its happened several times in our history. And I think that probably is the most important consideration in picking a vice president, somebody who could take over.",2004-10-05,Republican

Cheney,"Why I am different from John Edwards. Well, in some respects, I think, probably there are more similarities than there are differences in our personal story. I dont talk about myself very much, but Ive heard Senator Edwards, and as I listen to him, I find some similarities. I come from relatively modest circumstances. My grandfather never even went to high school. Im the first in my family to graduate from college. I carried a ticket in the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers for six years. Ive been laid off, been hospitalized without health insurance. So I have some idea of the problems that people encounter. So I think the personal stories are, in some respects, surprisingly similar. With respect to how weve spent our careers, I obviously made a choice for public service. And Ive been at it for a good long time now, except for those periods when we lost elections. And that goes with the turf, as well, too. Im absolutely convinced that the threat we face now, the idea of a terrorist in the middle of one of our cities with a nuclear weapon, is very real and that we have to use extraordinary measures to deal with it. I feel very strongly that the significance of 9/11 cannot be underestimated. It forces us to think in new ways about strategy, about national security, about how we structure our forces and about how we use U.S. military power. Some people say we should wait until we are attacked before we use force. I would argue weve already been attacked. We lost more people on 9/11 than we lost at Pearl Harbor. And Im a very strong advocate of a very aggressive policy of going after the terrorists and those who support terror.",2004-10-05,Republican

The reality is that the best defense is a good offense, which means leading  America returning to its proud tradition of the last 75 years, of once again leading strong coalitions so we can get at these terrorist cells where they are, before they can do damage to us and to the American people. John Kerry made clear on Thursday night that  Im sorry, I broke the rules. We made clear  we made clear on Thursday night that we will do that, and we will do it aggressively. But there are things that need to be done to keep this country safe that have not yet been done. For example, three years after 9/11, we find out that the administration still does not have a unified terrorist watch list. Its amazing. Three years. What are we waiting for? You know, we still dont have one list that everyone can work off of to see if terrorists are entering this country. Were screening our passengers going onto airplanes, but we dont screen the cargo. There are so many things that could be done to keep this country safe. You have to be strong, and you have to be aggressive. But we also have to be smart.

Weve made very clear from the beginning  and not an afterthought; we said it at the time  that we had to confront Saddam Hussein and that we had to have a coalition and a plan to be successful. And the vice president didnt say much about it in your earlier question, but Paul Bremer has now made clear that they didnt have enough troops and they didnt have a plan. And the American people are seeing the results of that every single day, in spite of the proud and courageous service of our men and women in uniform. Now, flip-flops: They should know something about flip-flops. Theyve seen a lot of it during their administration. They were first against the 9/11 Commission; then they were for it. They were for a department of homeland security  I mean, they were against the Department of Homeland Security; then they were for it. They said they were going to put $2 trillion of the surplus when they came into office aside to protect Social Security; then they changed their minds. They said that they supported the troops; and then while our troops were on the ground in Iraq and Afghanistan, they went to the Congress and lobbied to have their combat pay cut. They said that they were going to do something about health care in this country. And theyve done something: Theyve made it worse. They said that they were going to fund their No Child Left Behind; $27 billion short today. Over and over, this administration has said one thing and done another. This president said  I listened to him the other night at his 2000 debate saying: Im for a national patients bill of rights. I know something about this.

Ifill,"Mr. Vice President? CHENEY: Well, Gwen, I can think of a lot of words to describe Senator Kerrys position on Iraq; consistent is not one of them. I think if you look at the record from voting for sending the troops then voting against the resources they needed when they got there, then saying I actually voted for the $87 billion before I voted against it, saying in response to a question knowing everything I know now, yes, I would have cast exactly the same vote and then shortly after that saying wrong war, wrong place, wrong time, consistency doesnt come to mind as I consider that record. The question of troops is an interesting and important one. We have looked to our commanders on the ground in Iraq for guidance on what they think they need. If they need more troops, theyll ask us. But the key here is not to try to solve the problems in Iraq by putting in more American troops. The key is to get the Iraqis to take on the responsibility for their own security. Thats exactly what were doing. If you put American troops in there in larger number and dont get the Iraqis into the fight, youll postpone the day when you can in fact bring our boys home.

John and I have  and I dont have the time now  but we have a clear plan to improve our public schools that starts with getting our best teachers into the schools where we need them the most by creating incentives for them to go there.",2004-10-05,Democrat

The results coming in from a number of studies show, without question, that on math and reading, that in fact our minority students, our Hispanic and African-American students are doing better, and that gap between them and the majority population is, in fact, closing. So we are doing exactly the right thing. Theyre the ones who have been for the Patriot Act and against it, for No Child Left Behind and then against it.",2004-10-05,Republican

Edwards,"Well, in fairness, if you feel like you need to go to him, well  Ill stop. IFILL: Well, I do, because were actually on the final question. I apologize for giving you an extra 15 seconds there. I go now to Vice President Cheney. Whichever one of you is elected in November  you mentioned those three electoral votes in Wyoming and how critical theyve turned out to be. But what theyre a sign of also is that youre going to inherit a very deeply divided electorate, economically, politically, you name it.",2004-10-05,Democrat
Cheney,"Well, I must say its one of the disappointments of the last four years, is that weve not been able to do what the president did in Texas, for example, when he was able to reach across the aisle and bring Democrats along on major issues of the day. We had some success early on, I think, in No Child Left Behind, when we, in fact, had broad, bipartisan support. We had a lot of support for the Patriot Act, when we passed that on a bipartisan basis. Now were seeing objection to that by the other side. All I know is to continue to try to work it. Its a disappointment, in a sense, that I remember from my earlier service when things worked much differently, when, in fact, some of my best friends in the Congress were people I worked with, like Tom Foley, who was a majority leader and later speaker of the House. One of my strongest allies in Congress when I was secretary of defense was Jack Murtha, a Democrat who is chairman of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee. We used to be able to do more together on a bipartisan basis than seems possible these days. Im not sure exactly why. I think, in part, it may be the change in the majority-minority status in the Senate has been difficult for both sides to adjust to. And the Senate, of course, has been very evenly divided, 50-50, then 51-49, then 49-51 the other way. Well keep working at it. I think its important for us to try. I believe that it is essential for us to do everything we can to garner as much support from the other side of the aisle as possible. Weve had support  we had our keynote address at our convention was delivered by Zell Miller. So there are some Democrats who agree with our approach. And hopefully in a second term, well see an improvement along those lines.",2004-10-05,Republican

Edwards,"Thank you. The president said that he would unite this country, that he was a uniter, not a divider. The reality is it is not an accident. Its the direct result of the choices theyve made and their efforts that have created division in America. We can do better than that in this country. Now I want to go back to the whole issue of health care, because we touched it, but I think the American people deserve to know what we would do different. I mean, 5 million people losing their health care  everyone whos watching this knows health insurance premiums are through the roof. We need to talk about what we will do that they havent done. First, were going to make the same health care thats available to members of Congress available to all Americans. Were going to cover all kids. Not only that, were going to bring down costs by pooling the catastrophic costs so we bring down premiums. And were going to give tax breaks directly to families, save them up to $1,000 a year, and to businesses  the vice president talked about that a few minutes ago  so that they can provide health care to their employees. And were also going to finally do something about the cost of prescription drugs. Theyve blocked allowing prescription drugs into this country from Canada. Were going to allow it. They would not allow the government to use its negotiating power to get discounts for seniors. Were going to allow it. Were also going to stand up to the drug companies and do something about these drug company ads on television which are out of control.",2004-10-05,Democrat
Ifill,"You have 30 seconds to respond to that, Mr. Vice President.",2004-10-05,Moderator
Cheney,"Well, Gwen  Im sorry, its hard to know where to start. The fact of the matter is, the most important and significant change in health care in the last several years was the Medicare reform bill this year. Its the most sweeping change in 40 years. Medicare used to pay for heart bypass surgery but didnt pay for the prescription drugs that might allow you to avoid it. The fact is that when that came up, Senator Kerry and Senator Edwards voted against it. Itll provide prescription drug benefits to 40 million senior citizens. Its a very, very significant piece of legislation.",2004-10-05,Republican

They had a choice on the patients bill of rights, allowing people to make their own health care decisions and not having insurance companies make them, be with the American people, be with the big insurance companies. Theyre with the insurance companies. John Kerry and I will always fight for the American people.",2004-10-05,Democrat

Edwards,"Thank you. Thank you, Gwen. Thank you, Mr. Vice President, for being here. You know, when I was young and growing up, I remember coming down the steps into the kitchen, early in the morning, and I would see the glow of the television. And Id see my father sitting at a table. He wasnt paying bills, and he wasnt doing paperwork from work. What he was doing was learning math on television. Now, he didnt have a college education, but he was doing what he could do to get a better job in the mill where he worked. I was proud of him. Im still proud of him. And I was also hopeful, because I knew that I lived in a country where I could get a college education. Heres the truth: I have grown up in the bright light of America. But that light is flickering today. Now, I know that the vice president and the president dont see it, but you do. You see it when your incomes are going down and the cost of everything  college tuition, health care  is going through the roof. You see it when you sit at your table each night and theres an empty chair because a loved one is serving in Iraq or Afghanistan. What theyre going to give you is four more years of the same. John Kerry and I believe that we can do better. We believe in a strong middle-class in this country. Thats why we have a plan to create jobs, getting rid of tax cuts for companies outsourcing your jobs; give tax cuts to companies thatll keep jobs here in America. Thats why we have a health care plan. Thats why we have a plan to keep you safe and to fix this mess in Iraq. The truth is that every four years you get to decide. You have the ability to decide where Americas going to go.

Cheney,"Gwen, I want to thank you. Its been a privilege to serve as your vice president these last four years and to work alongside President Bush to put our economy on an upward path. Weve cut taxes, added 1.7 million new jobs in the last year, and well continue to provide opportunities for business and for workers. We wont be happy until every American who wants to work can find a job. We believe that all Americans ought to have access to available  to medical care and that they ought to have access to the finest schools in the world. Well do everything we can to preserve Social Security and to make certain that its there for future generations. Ive worked for four presidents and watched two others up close, and I know that theres no such thing as a routine day in the Oval Office. We saw on 9/11 that the next president  next decision a president has to make can affect the lives of all of us. Now we find ourselves in the midst of a conflict unlike any weve ever known, faced with the possibility that terrorists could smuggle a deadly biological agent or a nuclear weapon into the middle of one of our own cities. That threat  and the presidential leadership needed to deal with it  is placing a special responsibility on all of you who will decide on November 2nd who will be our commander in chief. The only viable option for winning the war on terrorism is the one the president has chosen, to use the power of the United States to aggressively go after the terrorists wherever we find them and also to hold to account states that sponsor terror. Now that weve captured or killed thousands of Al Qaida and taken down the regimes of Saddam Hussein and the Taliban, its important that we stand up democratically elected governments as the only guarantee that theyll never again revert to terrorism or the production of deadly weapons. This is the task of our generation. And I know firsthand the strength the president brings to it. The overall outcome will depend upon the ability of the American people and the strong leadership of the president to meet all the challenges that well face in the days and years ahead. Im confident we can do it.",2004-10-05,Republican

Woodruff,"On behalf of the Commission on Presidential Debates, I am pleased to welcome you to this Vice Presidential debate. Im Judy Woodruff of PBS MacNeil-Lehrer News Hour and Frontline. My colleagues on the panel are: John Margolis of the Chicago Tribune; Tom Brokaw of NBC NEWS; and Brit Hume of ABC NEWS. The importance of tonights debate is underscored by two facts. Both George Bush and Michael Dukakis said their selections of a running mate would reveal a lot about themselves. And based on the history since World War II, there is almost a 50-50 chance that one of the two men here tonight will become President of the United States. The candidates are Senator Dan Quayle, the Republican nominee, and Senator Lloyd Bentsen, the Democratic nominee. (Applause)",1988-10-05,Moderator
Woodruff,"For the next 90 minutes we will be questioning the candidates following a format designed and agreed to by representatives of the two campaigns. However, there are no restrictions on the questions that my colleagues and I may ask this evening. By prior agreement between the two candidates, the first question goes to Senator Quayle, and you have two minutes to respond. Senator, you have been criticized, as we all know, for your decision to stay out of the Vietnam War, for your poor academic record. But more troubling to some are some of the comments that have been made by people in your own party. Just last week former Secretary of State Haig said that your pick was the dumbest call George Bush could have made. Your leader in the Senate. (Applause)",1988-10-05,Moderator
Woodruff,Your leader in the Senate Bob Dole said that a better qualified person could have been chosen. Other Republicans have been far more critical in private. Why do you think that you have not made a more substantial impression on some of these people who have been able to observe you up close?,1988-10-05,Moderator
Quayle,"The question goes to whether I am qualified to be Vice President, and in the case of a tragedy, whether Im qualified to be President. Qualifications for the office of Vice President or President are not age alone. You must look at accomplishments, and you must look at experience. I have more experience than others that have sought the office of Vice President. Now lets look at qualifications, and lets look at the three biggest issues that are going to be confronting America in the next presidency. Those three issues are national security and arms control; jobs and education; and the Federal budget deficit. On each one of those issues I have more experience than does the Governor of Massachusetts. In national security and arms control, you have to understand the difference between a ballistic missile, a warhead, what throwweight, what megatonnage is. You better understand about telemetry and encryption. And you better understand that you have to negotiate from a position of strength. These are important issues, because we want to have more arms control and arms reductions. In the area of jobs and education, I wrote the Job Training Partnership Act, a bipartisan bill, a bill that has trained and employed over three million economically disadvantaged youth and adults in this country. On the area of the Federal budget deficit, I have worked eight years on the Senate Budget Committee. And I wish that the Congress would give us the line item veto to help deal with that. And if qualifications alone are going to be the issue in this campaign, George Bush has more qualifications than Michael Dukakis and Lloyd Bentsen combined. (Applause)",1988-10-05,Republican
Woodruff,"Senator Bentsen  Im going to interrupt at this point and ask once again that the audience please keep your responses as quiet as possible. We know that many of you here are for one candidate or another. But you are simply taking time away from your candidate, and more likely than not, youll be causing the partisans for the other candidate to react again when their candidate speaks. So please. Senator Bentsen, you have one minute to respond.",1988-10-05,Moderator
Bentsen,"This debate tonight is not about the qualifications for the Vice Presidency. The debate is whether or not Dan Quayle and Lloyd Bentsen are qualified to be President of the United States. Because Judy, just as you have said, that has happened too often in the past. And if that tragedy should occur, we have to step in there without any margin for error, without time for preparation, to take over the responsibility for the biggest job in the world, that of running this great country of ours; to take over the awesome responsibility for commanding the nuclear weaponry that this country has. No, the debate tonight is a debate about the presidency itself, and a presidential decision that has to be made by you. The stakes could not be higher.",1988-10-05,Democrat
Woodruff,"Senator Bentsen, a question for you, and you also have two minutes to respond. What bothers people is not so much your qualifications but your split on policy with Gov. Dukakis. He has said that he does not want a clone of himself, but you disagree with him on some major issues: aid to the Nicaraguan Contras; the death penalty; gun control; among others. If you had to step into the presidency, whose agenda would you pursue, yours or his?",1988-10-05,Moderator
Bentsen,"Well, I am delighted to respond to that question, because we agree on so many things and the vast majority of the issues. We agree on the fact that we have to cut this deficit. And Gov. Dukakis has been able to cut that deficit ten budgets in a row in the State of Massachusetts, while he lowered the tax burden on their people from one of the highest to one of the lower in the United States. That is a major sense of achievement. And I admire that. And Im just delighted to be on the ticket with him. Gov. Dukakis and I agreed that we ought to have a trade policy for this country; that weve seen this Administration more than double the national debt, that; theyve moved this country from the number one lender nation in the world to the number one debtor nation in the world under their Administration; that they have not had a trade policy; that they have let trade be a handmaiden for their foreign policy objectives of the country; that this country has exported too many jobs and not enough products. And as I worked to pass a trade bill through the United States Senate, they threw roadblocks in the way every step of the way. But we passed a trade bill that has this premise, that any country that has full access to our markets, were entitled to full access to their markets. Now, that means that were going to stand tough for America, and were going to protect those jobs, and were going to push American products, and were going to open up markets around the world. Well show leadership in that respect, and turn this deficit and trade around. Thats the sort of thing that Michael Dukakis and I will do to bring about a better America for all our people.",1988-10-05,Democrat
Woodruff,"Senator Quayle, a minute to respond.",1988-10-05,Moderator
Quayle,"As you notice, Senator Bentsen didnt tell you very much about what Gov. Dukakis would do  Gov. Dukakis, one of the most liberal governors in the United States of America The one thing he tried to point out about Gov. Dukakis is that hes cut taxes. The fact of the matter is, Senator Bentsen, hes raised taxes five times. He just raised taxes this past year. And thats why a lot of people refer to him as Tax-hike Mike. Thats why they refer to the State of Massachusetts as Taxachusetts. Because every time theres a problem, the liberal governor from Massachusetts raises taxes. I dont blame Senator Bentsen for not talking about Gov. Michael Dukakis. Hes talking more about his record. If I had to defend the liberal policies of Gov. Michael Dukakis, I wouldnt talk about it either.",1988-10-05,Republican
Woodruff,"John Margolis, a question for Senator Bentsen.",1988-10-05,Moderator
Margolis,"Senator Bentsen, you have claimed that Vice President Bush and the Republicans will raid the Social Security Trust Fund, and you have vowed to protect it. But as Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, you must know that there is something to the argument of your fellow Democrat Bob Strauss that some restraint on Social Security growth may be needed, or at least some decision to tax most Social Security benefits as regular income. In fact, you once voted for and spoke for a six-month delay on cost of living adjustment increases for Social Security. Senator, arent you and Gov. Dukakis using this issue politically, rather than dealing with it responsibly?",1988-10-05,Moderator
Bentsen,"Well, I must say I hate to disappoint my good friend Bob Strauss, but we have a contract with the American people on Social Security. And Social Security is an issue where Senator Quayle voted eight times to cut the benefits on Social Security, where this administration came in and tried to cut the benefits, the minimum benefits, $122 a month for widows, for retirees, tried to cut the benefits for 62-year-old retirees by 40 percent, tried to do an end run on Social Security when they first came in after promising not to cut it  to cut it by some 20 billion, and while we were working together to reform the Social Security system and to be certain that that money was going to be there for people when they retired. At that point they tried a $40-billion end run to cut Social Security. Now, the record is clear. And we saw Vice President Bush fly back from the west coast to break a tie in the United States Senate. He doesnt get to vote very often in the Senate, but he made a special trip to come back and vote against a cost-of-living increase. Now, when you talk about Social Security, the people that are going to protect it are the Democrats that brought forth that program. And I think its very important that we not see these kinds of end runs by this administration. When they talk about the fact that they are going to continue to cut this budget, I know too well what their rack record is. And we should be concerned with that kind of an effort once again after the election is over.",1988-10-05,Democrat
Woodruff,"Senator Quayle, your response?",1988-10-05,Moderator
Quayle,"Senator Bentsen, you know that I did not vote to cut Social Security benefits eight times. What I have voted for and what Senator Bentsen has voted for is to delay the cost-of-living adjustments. Senator Bentsen two times in the United States Senate voted to delay the cost-of-living adjustments. The governor of Massachusetts at a governors conference supported a resolution to delay the cost-of-living adjustment. And, John, you are right: they use this for political advantage. What they try to do time and time again is to scare the old people of this country. Thats the politics of the past. In 1983 Republicans and Democrats dropped their political swords and in a bipartisan effort saved the Social Security system. Republicans and Democrats banded together because we know that this program is not a Republican program, its not a Democrat program  its a program for older Americans. And that program is actuarially sound to the turn of this century.",1988-10-05,Republican
Woodruff,"John, a question for Senator Quayle.",1988-10-05,Moderator
Margolis,"Senator, since coming to the Senate you have voted against environmental protection legislation about two-thirds of the time. This includes votes against pesticide controls, the toxic waste superfund, and health and safety protection from nuclear wastes. Senator, do you consider yourself an environmentalist, and, if you do, how do you reconcile that with your voting record?",1988-10-05,Moderator
Quayle,"I have a very strong record on the environment in the United States Senate. (Laughter) I have a record where I voted for the superfund legislation. I have a record where I voted against my president on the override of the Clean Water Act. I have voted for the major pieces of environmental legislation that have come down and been voted on in the United States Senate. This administration  and I support this administration and its environmental efforts  has moved in the area for the first time to deal with the ozone problem. We now have an international treaty, the treaty that is commonly referred to as the Montreal Treaty. For the first time we are talking about the impact of CO2 to the ozone layer. Thats progress with the environment. We are committed to the environment. I take my children hiking and fishing, walking in the woods, in the wilderness. Believe me, we have a commit to preserving the environment. You bring up the environment, you cant help but think about the environmental policy of the governor of Massachusetts. He talks about being an environmentalist. Let me tell you about his environmental policy. The Boston Harbor  the Boston Harbor, which is the dirtiest waterway in America, tons of raw sewage go in there each and every day. What has the governor of Massachusetts done about that? Virtually nothing. And then he has the audacity to go down to New Jersey and tell the people of New Jersey that hes against ocean dumping. This is the same governor that applied for a license to dump Massachusetts sewage waste off the coast of New Jersey. Who has the environmental record? Who has the environmental interest? George Bush and I do.",1988-10-05,Republican
Woodruff,Senator Bentsen.,1988-10-05,Moderator
Bentsen,"This late conversion is interesting to me. (Laughter and applause) I must say, when they talk about Boston Harbor and he says he hasnt done anything, the facts are he has a $6-billion program under way on waste treatment. And it was this administration, their administration, that cut out the money early on to be able to clean up water, and made it impossible to move ahead at that time on Boston Harbor. We are the authors, the Democratic Party, of Clean Air, of Clean Water, of the superfund. I am one who played a very major role in passing the superfund legislation. And every environmental organization that I know, every major one, has now endorsed the Dukakis-Bentsen ticket. And I am one who has just received the environmental award in Texas for the work Ive done to clean up the bays, to clean up the water, off the coast of Texas. No, I think we know well whos going to help clean up this environment. The record is there, the history is there. And Dukakis and Bentsen will be committed to that. (Applause)",1988-10-05,Democrat
Woodruff,"Tom Brokaw, a question for Senator Quayle.",1988-10-05,Moderator
Brokaw,"Thank you, Judy. Senator Quayle, theres been a lot of talk during the course of this campaign about family. It was a principal theme, as I recall, in your acceptance speech in New Orleans. Tonight Id like to ask you about the sixty-five million American children who live with their families in poverty. Id like for you to describe to the audience the last time that you may have visited with one of those families personally and how you explain to that family your votes against the school breakfast program, the school lunch program, and the expansion of the child immunization program. (Applause)",1988-10-05,Moderator
Quayle,"I have met with those people, and I met with them in Fort Wayne, Indiana, at a food bank. You may be surprised, Tom, they didnt ask me those questions on those votes, because they were glad that I took time out of my schedule to go down and to talk about how we are going to get a food bank going and making sure that a food bank goes in Fort Wayne, Indiana. And I have a very good record and a commitment to the poor, to those that dont have a family, that want to have a family. This administration, and a George Bush administration, will be committed to eradicating poverty. Poverty hasnt gone up in this administration; it hasnt gone down much either, and that means we have a challenge ahead of us. But let me tell you something, what we have done for the poor. What we have done for the poor is that we in fact  the homeless bill, the McKinney Act, which is the major piece of legislation that deals with homeless  the Congress has cut the funding that the administration has recommended. The poor and the poverty  the biggest thing that we have done for poverty in America is the Tax Simplification Act of 1986: six million working poor families got off the payroll; six million people are off the taxpaying payrolls because of that tax reform, and they are keeping the tax money there. To help the poor, well have a commitment to the programs and those programs will go on. And we are spending more in poverty programs today than we were in 1981  that is a fact. The poverty program we are going to concentrate on is creating jobs and opportunities, so that everyone will have the opportunities that they want.] (Scattered applause)",1988-10-05,Republican
Woodruff,"Senator Bentsen, your response.",1988-10-05,Moderator
Bentsen,"I find that very interesting, because he has been of no help at all when it comes to passing the most major welfare reform bill in the history of our country, one where we are working very hard to see that people can get off welfare, break that cycle, take a step up in life, doing the kinds of things that we did there to let them have Medicaid for a year. Thats a positive thing thats done. What also frustrates me with the kind of report that I have just heard here is the kind of votes that he has cast against child nutrition programs, the fact that he has voted against money that we needed for further immunization, the denial of polio shots to kids where the parents couldnt afford to get that kind of a shot. Now, I dont really believe that that is identifying with the concerns of people in poverty.",1988-10-05,Democrat
Woodruff,"Tom, a question for Senator Bentsen.",1988-10-05,Moderator
Brokaw,"Senator Bentsen, Id like to take you back to the question that Judy asked you about your differences with Michael Dukakis on contra aid. After all, the contra aid is one of the cutting issues of foreign policy of this country in the last eight years. You and Michael Dukakis seem to be diametrically opposed on that. 1 have been told that in a closed session of the U.S. Senate you made one of the most eloquent and statesmanlike speeches in behalf of contra aid that anyone had made in the eight years of the Reagan term, that in fact you alluded to the threat that the Sandinista regime could pose to your own state of Texas. Governor Dukakis, on the other hand, has described the contra aid policy as immoral and illegal. Is he wrong? (Scattered applause)",1988-10-05,Moderator
Bentsen,"Gov. Dukakis and I have disagreed on the contra program; no question about that. But my big difference with this Administration is, they look at the contra aid program as the only way to resolve that problem. They concentrate on that. And I really think we have to give peace a chance. And thats why I have been a strong supporter of the Arias plan, a plan that won the Nobel Prize for President Arias, the President of Costa Rica. I believe you have to work with the leaders of those other Central American countries to try to bring about the democratization of Nicaragua  by negotiation, by pressure, by counseling, by diplomatic pressure, that we ought to be trying that first. But in concentrating so much just on the Contras, this Administration has not paid enough attention to the rest of Central America. The concern I have is that we have a country with 85 million people sharing a 2,000mile border with us, with half of those people under the age of 15, a country thats had its standard of living cut 50 percent in the last six years. Now we ought to be concerned about that, and we ought to be involved. I was born and reared on that Mexican border. I speak their language. Ive spent a good part of my life down there. Gov. Dukakis speaks Spanish, too. Hes spent a good deal of time in Central and South America. And we believe that we ought to be working with a new Alliance for Progress, bringing in other countries to help; bring in Europeans, the Spanish, who have a real affinity for that area; bringing in the Japanese who have a great surplus now and looking for places to invest it. Those are the positive things I think we could do to bring about peace in that area, to help raise that standard of living and give them the kind of stability where democracy can proceed and can prosper and bloom. Those are the kinds of things that wed be committed to in a Dukakis-Bentsen Administration to try to make this world a better place in which to live.",1988-10-05,Democrat
Woodruff,"Senator Quayle, your response.",1988-10-05,Moderator
Quayle,"Theres no doubt in a Dukakis Administration that the aid would be cut off to the democratic resistance in Nicaragua, and that is unfortunate. The reason it is unfortunate, because it is beyond me why its okay for the Soviet Union to put in billions of dollars to prop up the communist Sandinistas, but somehow its wrong for the United States to give a few dollars to the democratic resistance. Theres a thing called the Monroe Doctrine, something that the Governor of Massachusetts has said has been superseded. I doubt if many Americans agree with that. I think they believe in the Monroe Doctrine. Senator Bentsen talked about the entire Central America. Theres another issue that Michael Dukakis is wrong on in Central America, and thats Grenada. He criticized our rescue mission in Grenada, according to a UPI report. Criticized that, yet 85 percent of the American people supported our rescue mission, and we turned a communist country into a noncommunist country. The Governor of Massachusetts is simply out of step with mainstream America.",1988-10-05,Republican
Woodruff,"Brit Hume, a question for Senator Bentsen.",1988-10-05,Moderator
Hume,"Good evening, Senator Bentsen, Senator Quayle. Im sort of the cleanup man in this order, and Ive been asked by my colleagues to try to deal with anything thats been left on base. Senator, I have a follow up question for you, Senator Quayle. But Senator Bentsen, I first want to ask you a question about PAC money, a thing Im sure youre prepared to talk about. Gov. Dukakis has tried to make ethics a major issue in the campaign. And he has you as a running mate, a man who leads the league at last count in the receipt of PAC money, that being the money raised by the special interest organizations. That is a kind of campaign financing which Gov. Dukakis finds so distasteful that he has refused to accept any of it. Do you find that embarrassing, Senator?",1988-10-05,Moderator
Bentsen,"No, I dont find it embarrassing at all. Because you have to remember that PAC money is the result of the last campaign reform bill, one that talks about employees have greater participation. And what Ive done in PAC money is just what my opponent in my campaign has done in his campaign. He has been raising PAC money, too. So what you have to do is comply with the laws as they are, whether youre paying taxes or youre playing a football game. Whether you like those laws or not, you comply with them. Now, I have been for campaign reform, and have pushed it very hard. I believe that we have to do some things in that regard. But Ive noticed that the Senator from Indiana has opposed that campaign reform and voted repeatedly against it. The things we have to do, I believe, that will cut back on soft money, for example, which I look on as frankly one of those things that weve had to do because the Republicans have done it for so long. But I think its a loophole, frankly. But campaign reform, changing the rules of the game, is something we tried repeatedly in this session of the Congress, but only to have the Republicans lead the charge against us and defeat us. And I wish that Senator Quayle would change his mind on that particular piece of legislation and give us the kind of a campaign reform law that I think is needed in America.",1988-10-05,Democrat
Woodruff,"Senator Quayle, your response.",1988-10-05,Moderator
Quayle,"Senator Bentsen is the number one PAC raiser. As a matter of fact, he used to have a $10,000 breakfast club. $10,000 breakfast club. It only costs high paid lobbyists, special interests in Washington, to come down and have breakfast with the Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, the one that oversees all the tax loopholes in the tax code, $10,000. Im sure they werent paying to have cornflakes. Well, Ill tell you the kind of campaign reform Im supporting, Senator Bentsen. I think its time we get rid of PAC money. Support our legislation where we totally eliminate contributions by special interests and political action committees, and lets have the individual contribute and the political parties contribute. Thats the kind of campaign reform that Republicans are for. They want to get rid of this special interest and rely on the individuals, and also, the political parties.",1988-10-05,Republican

Hume,"Senator, I want to take you back if I can to the question Judy asked you about some of the apprehensions people may feel about your being a heart beat away from the presidency. And let us assume if we can for the sake of this question that you have become Vice President and the President is incapacitated for one reason or another, and you have to take the reins of power. When that moment came, what would be the first steps that youd take, and why?",1988-10-05,Moderator
Quayle,"First  first, Id say a prayer for myself and for the country that Im about to lead. And then I would assemble his people and talk. And I think this question keeps going back to the qualifications and what kind of Vice President in this hypothetical situation, if I had to assume the responsibilities of President, what I would be. And as I have said, age alone, although I can tell you, after the experiences of these last few week in the campaign, Ive added ten years to my age, age alone is not the only qualification. Youve got to look at experience, and youve got to look at accomplishments, and can you make a difference. Have I made a difference in the United States Senate where Ive served for eight years? Yes, I have. Have I made a difference in the Congress that Ive served for 12 years? Yes, I have. As I said before, looking at the issue of qualifications  and I am delighted that it comes up, because on the three most important challenges facing America, arms control and national security, jobs and education and budget deficit, I have more experience and accomplishments than does the Governor of Massachusetts. I have been in the Congress and Ive worked on these issues. And believe me, when you look at arms control and trying to deal with the Soviet Union, you cannot come at it from a naive position. You have to understand the Soviet Union. You have to understand how they will respond. Sitting on that Senate Armed Services Committee for eight years has given me the experience to deal with the Soviet Union and how we can move forward. That is just one of the troubling issues thats going to be facing this nation, and Im prepared.",1988-10-05,Republican

Bentsen,"Well, I cant leave something on the table that hes charged me with, and so lets get to that one. When you talk about the breakfast club, as you know, that was perfectly legal. And I formed it, and I closed it down almost immediately because I thought the perception was bad. But its the same law  its the same law  that lets you invite high priced lobbyists down to Williamsburg. And bring them down there and entertain them playing golf, playing tennis, and bringing Republican Senators down there, to have exchanged for that contributions to their campaign. Its the same kind of law that lets you have honorariums  and youve collected over a quarter of a million dollars of honorariums now, speaking to various interest groups. And theres no control over what you do with that money. You can spend it on anything you want to. You can spent it on golf club dues, if you want to do that. (Applause)",1988-10-05,Democrat

Woodruff,"John Margolis, question for Senator Quayle.",1988-10-05,Moderator
Margolis,"Senator Quayle, in recent years the Reagan administration has scaled back the activities of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, prompted in part by Vice President Bushs Task Force on Regulatory Relief. The budget for the agency has been cut by 20 percent and the number of inspections and manufacturing plants has been reduced by 33 percent. This has had a special effect in this area where many people work in the meat packing industry, which has a far higher rate of serious injuries than almost any other injury, a rate which appears to have been rising, although were not really sure, because some of the largest companies have allegedly falsifying their reports. Would you acknowledge to the hundreds of injured and maimed people Nebraska, Iowa and elsewhere in the Midwest that in this case deregulation may have gone too far and the government should reassert itself in protecting workers rights.",1988-10-05,Moderator
Quayle,"The premise of your question, John, is that somehow this administration has been lax in enforcement of the OSHA regulations. And I disagree with that. And Ill tell you why. If you want to ask some business people that I talk to periodically, they complain about the tough enforcement of this administration and, furthermore, let me tell you this for the record, when we have found violations in this administration, there has not only been tough enforcement, but there have been the most severe penalties  the largest penalties in the history of the Department of Labor  have been levied when these violations have been found. There is a commitment and there will always be a commitment to the safety of our working men and women. They deserve it and were committed to them. Now, the broader question goes to the whole issue of deregulation and has deregulation worked or has deregulation not worked. In my judgment deregulation has worked. We have a deregulated economy and we have produced through low taxes, not high taxes, through deregulation  the spirit of entrepreneurship, the individual going out and starting a business, the businessman or women willing to go out and risk their investments to start up a business and hire people. We have produced 17 million jobs in this country since 1982. Deregulation as a form of political philosophy is a good philosophy. Its one that our opponents disagree with. They want a centralized government. But we believe in the market, we believe in the people and yes, theres a role of government and the role of government is to make sure that those safety  and health and the welfare of the people is taken care of. And well continue to do that.",1988-10-05,Republican
Woodruff,Senator Bentsen?,1988-10-05,Moderator
Bentsen,"Well, I think you see once again a piece of Democratic legislation thats been passed to try protect the working men and women of America. And then youve seen an administration that came in and really didnt have its heart in that kind of an enforcement. A good example of that is the environmental protection laws that we were talking about a moment ago. This administration came in and put in a James Watt, an Ann Gorsuch, now thats the Bonnie and Clyde, really, of environmental protection. And thats why its important that you have people that truly believe and trying to represent the working men and women of America. Most employers do a good job of that, but some of them put their profits before people and thats why you have to have OSHA and thats why you have to have tough and good and fair enforcement of it and thats what a Democratic administration would do to help make this working place a safer and better place to be employed.",1988-10-05,Democrat
Woodruff,"John Margolis, another question for Senator Bentsen.",1988-10-05,Moderator
Margolis,"Senator Bentsen, since you have been in the Senate, the government has spent increasing amounts of money in an effort to protect the family farmer. Though most of the subsidies seem to go  do go to the largest and richest farmers who presumably need it least, while its the smaller farmers who are often forced to sell out, sometimes to their large farmer neighbor whos gotten more subsidies to begin with. Despite the fact that I believe you, sir, are a rather large farmer, yourself, do you believe that its time to uncouple the subsidy formula from the amount of land the farmer has and target Federal money to the small and medium size farmer?",1988-10-05,Moderator
Bentsen,"Well, Ive supported that. I voted for the 50,000 limitation to get away from the million dollar contributions to farmer. You know, of the four that are on this ticket, Im the only on that was born and reared on a farm and still involved in farming, so I think I understand their concerns and their problems. Now, I feel very strongly that we ought to be doing more for the American farmer and what weve seen under this administration is neglect of that farmer. Weve seen them drive 220,000 farmers off the farm. They seem to think the answer is move them to town, but we ought not to be doing that. What you have seen them do is cut the farm assistance for the rural areas by over 50 percent. Were seeing rural hospitals close all over the country because of this kind of an administration. Weve seen an administration that has lost much of our market abroad, because they have not had a trade policy. We saw our market loss by some 40 percent. And thats one of the reasons that weve seen the cost of the farm program, which was only about two and a half billion dollars when they took office, now go to about $25 billion. Now, we can bring that kind of a cost down and get more to market prices if well have a good trade policy. I was in January visiting with Mr. Takeshita, the new Prime Minister of Japan. I said, Youre paying five times as much for beef as we pay for our in country  pay for it in our country, six times as much for rice. You have a $60 billion trade surplus with us. You could improve the standard of living of your people. Youre spending 27 percent of your disposable income. We spend 14 or 15 percent. When you have that kind of barrier up against us, thats not free and fair trade and we dont believe that should continue. We would be pushing very hard to open up those markets and stand up for the American farmer and see that we recapture those foreign markets and I think we can do it with the Dukakis-Bentsen administration.",1988-10-05,Democrat

Quayle,"Senator Bentsen talks about recapturing the foreign markets. Well, Ill tell you one way that were not going to recapture the foreign markets and that is if, in fact, we have another Jimmy Carter grain embargo. (Equal amounts of cheering and booing) Jimmy Carter  Jimmy Carter grain embargo set the American farmer back. You know what the farmers interested in? Net farm income. Every one percent in increase in interest rates, a billion dollars out of the farmers pocket. Net farm income, increased inflation, another billion dollars. Another thing that a farmer is not interested in and thats supply management that the Democratic platform talks about. But the Governor of Massachusetts, he has a farm program. He went to the farmers in the Midwest and told them not to grow corn, not to grow soybeans, but to grow Belgium [sic] endive. Thats what his  thats what he and his Harvard buddies think of the American farmer, grow Belgium endive. To come in and to tell our farmers not to grow corn, not to grow soybeans, thats the kind of farm policy youll get under a Dukakis administration and one I think the American farmer rightfully will reject.",1988-10-05,Republican

Brokaw,"Senator Bentsen, you were a businessman before you entered the U.S. Senate. Let me offer you an inventory if I may: Lower interest rates, lower unemployment, lower inflation and an arms control deal with the Soviet Union. Now two guys come through your door at your business and say, Wed like you to change, without offering a lot of specifics. Why would you accept their deal?",1988-10-05,Moderator
Bentsen,"You know, if you let me write $200 billion worth of hot checks every year, I could give you an illusion of prosperity, too. (Laughter and applause) This is an administration that has more than doubled the national debt, and theyve done that in less than eight years. They have taken this country from the No. 1 lender nation in the world to the No. 1 debtor nation in the world. And the interest on that debt next year, on this Reagan-Bush debt of our nation, is going to be $640 for every man, woman, and child in America because of this kind of a credit-card mentality. So we go out and we try to sell our securities every week, and hope that the foreigners will buy them. And they do buy them. But every time they do, we lose some of our economic independence for the future. Now theyve turned around and theyve bought 10 percent of the manufacturing base of this country. They bought 20 percent of the banks. They own 46 percent of the commercial real estate in Los Angeles. They are buying America on the cheap. Now, when we have other countries that cant manage their economy down in Central and South America, we send down the American ambassador, we send down the International Monetary Fund, and we tell them what they can buy and what they can sell and how to run their economies. The ultimate irony would be to have that happen to us, because foreigners finally quit buying our securities. So what we need in this country is someone like Mike Dukakis, who gave ten balanced budgets in a row there, and was able to do that, meet that kind of a commitment, set those tough priorities. We need an administration that will turn this trade policy around and open up those markets, stand tough with our trading partners to help keep the jobs at home and send the products abroad.",1988-10-05,Democrat

Well, the governor of Massachusetts has run up more debt than all the governors in the history of Massachusetts combined, going back to the days of the Pilgrims. I dont believe that thats the kind of policy that we want. The question went to the heart of the matter, Tom. You asked the question why would we change. Well, we have changed since 1980. Weve got interest rates down, weve got inflation down, people are working again, America is held in respect once again around the world. But we are going to build on that change. And as we made those positive changes of lower interest rates, lower rate of inflation, the governor of Massachusetts fought us every step of the way. We are proud of the record of accomplishment and the opportunities and the hope for millions of Americans.

If military force was necessary in that endeavor, why not use the military to go after the South American drug cartels and after General Noriega, for that matter, in a surgical strike, since drugs in the minds of most Americans pose a far greater danger to many more people? (Scattered applause)",1988-10-05,Moderator

Brokaw,But would you please address the military aspect of it.,1988-10-05,Moderator
Quayle,"I will address the military aspect, if I may respond. The military aspect of the drug problem is being addressed. As a matter of fact, we are using the Department of Defense in a coordinated effort, in reconnaissance. But I dont believe that we are going to turn the Department of Defense into a police organization. We are using our military assets in a prudent way to deal with interdiction, and weve made some success in this area. Seventy tons of cocaine have been stopped. But, you know, when you look at the drug problem  and it is a tremendous problem, and there are no easy solutions to it  its a complicated problem, and its heading up the effort to try to create a drug-free America, which is a challenge and a goal of all of us. Not only will we utilize national defense and the Department of Defense, but weve got to get on the demand side of the ledger; weve got to get to education. And education ought to begin at home, and it ought to be reinforced in our schools. And theres another thing that will be more important than the premise of this question on a hypothetical of using troops. We will use the military assets, we will use military assets  but we need to focus on another part of this problem, and that problem is law enforcement. And here is where we have a major disagreement with the governor of Massachusetts. He is opposed to the death penalty for drug kingpins. We believe people convicted of that crime deserve the death penalty, as does the legislation thats in the Congress that is supported by a bipartisan, including many Democrats of his party. He also was opposed to mandatory drug sentencing for drug dealers in the state of Massachusetts. You cannot have a war on drugs, you cannot be tough on drugs and weak on crime.",1988-10-05,Republican

(Shouts and applause) What we have seen under this administration  we have seen them using eight cabinet officers, twenty-eight different agencies, all fighting over turf  and that is one thing we would correct under a Dukakis-Bentsen administration. We would put one person in charge in the war against drugs, and we would commit the resources to get that job done. Now, Mike Dukakis has been able to do that type of thing in the state of Massachusetts by cutting the drug use in the high schools while its going up around the rest of the country, by putting in a drug educational program that the Drug Enforcement Agency said was a model to the country.

No one knows, but most scientists think, that something were doing, human beings are doing, are exacerbating this problem, and that this could, in a couple of generations, threaten our descendants comfort and health and perhaps even their existence. As Vice President what would you urge our government to do to deal with this problem? And specifically as a Texan, could you support a substantial reduction in the use of fossil fuels which might be necessary down the road?",1988-10-05,Moderator
Bentsen,"Well, I think what you can do in that one, and which would be very helpful, is to use a lot more natural gas, which burns a lot cleaner. And what Mike Dukakis has said is that hell try to break down those regulatory roadblocks that you have in the regulatory agency that denies much of the passage of that natural gas to the northeast, a way, in turn, can fight against acid rain which is another threat, because its sterilizing our lakes, its killing our fish. And its interesting to me to see in the resume of Senator Quayle that he brags on the fact that hes been able to fight the acid rain legislation. I dont think that thats a proper objective in trying to clean up this environment. But the greenhouse effect is one that has to be a threat to all of us, and we have to look for alternative sources of fuel. And Ive supported that very strongly. The Department of Energy is one that has cut back substantially on the study of those alternative sources of fuels. We can use other things thatll help the farmer. We can convert corn to ethanol, and I would push for that very strong. So absolutely. Ill do those things that are necessary to put the environment of our country number one. Because if we dont protect that, well destroy the future of our children.

It is important for us to get the data in, to see what alternatives we might have to the fossil fuels, and make sure we know what were doing.

One of the most troubling facts thats going to face the new Administration is the fact that the United States has now become the worlds largest debtor nation. In 1987 foreigners underwrote our debts to the tune of about $138 billion. Last week a top official of the Japanese Economic Planning Agency bragged that Japan now is in a position to influence the value of the dollar, of our interest rates, and even our stock prices. And he warned that one day maybe theyd do just that. If you were Vice President of the United States and Japan did that, what would you tell the President to do?",1988-10-05,Moderator

I would rather have people come over here and to make investments in this country, rather than going elsewhere. Because by coming over here, and making investments in this country, we are seeing jobs. Do you realize that today we are producing Hondas and exporting Hondas to Japan? We are the envy of the world.

And then when you go to Japan, where were spending 6-1/2 percent on defense of the democracies, theyre spending one percent. I met with some of the Japanese business leaders, talking to them about it. And I said, you know, we have 50,000 troops here in Japan, protecting the democracies of Asia. And it costs $3.5 billion a year. Youre the number two economic power in the world. You ought to measure up to that responsibility and carry some of that cost. I said, if we were not doing what were doing, wed have a big budget surplus.

And what would I do in this situation? I would make sure that the people in the cabinet and the people that are advisors to the president are called in, and I would talk to them, and I will work with them. And I will know them on a firsthand basis, because as vice president I will sit on the National Security Council. And I will know them on a firsthand basis, because Im going to be coordinating the drug effort. I will know them on a firsthand basis because Vice President George Bush is going to recreate the Space Council, and I will be in charge of that. I will have day-to-day activities with all the people in government. And then, if that unfortunate situation happens  if that situation, which would be very tragic, happens, I will be prepared to carry out the responsibilities of the presidency of the United States of America.

It is not just age; its accomplishments, its experience. I have far more experience than many others that sought the office of vice president of this country. I have as much experience in the Congress as Jack Kennedy did when he sought the presidency.

Brokaw,"Since you seem to be taking no hostages on the stage, let me ask you a question  (Laughter)  about the American hostages, nine, still in brutal captivity in the Middle East. Senator Bentsen, you have been critical of the Iran-contra affair, but tell me, does the Dukakis-Bentsen ticket have any realistic plan for getting the American hostages being held in the Middle East released in any due time?",1988-10-05,Moderator
Bentsen,"Tom, thats one of the toughest problems that any chief executive will face, because you cant help but have sympathy for that family, and for those hostages in the cells. But the one thing we ought to know by now is that you cant go out and make secret deals with the Ayatollah, you cant trade arms for hostages. When you try to do that there is no question but what you just encourage more taking of hostages. And thats been the result by this dumb idea that was cooked up in the White House basement. And I want to tell you that George Bush, attending seventeen of those meetings, and having no record of what he said  if Lloyd Bentsen was in those meetings, you would certainly hear from him and no one would be asking: Where is Lloyd? (Shouts and applause) Because I would be saying: Thats a dumb idea, and now lets put an end to it. And I would speak up on that type of thing. So all you can do in that is to continue to push, use every bit of diplomatic pressure you can, what you can do in the way of economic pressure in addition to that. And thats what you would strive to do to have a successful release finally of those hostages. But not to encourage more taking of hostages.",1988-10-05,Democrat
Woodruff,Senator Quayle.,1988-10-05,Moderator
Quayle,"Theres no doubt about it that arms for hostages is wrong, and it will never be repeated  we learn by our mistakes. But there have been a number of successes in foreign policy in this administration. But the question goes to a very difficult one: How do you do it? No one has the answer. If they did, we would certainly do it. But we will keep trying, well keep the doors open, and hopefully some day Iran and others who control those hostages will want to return to civilized international community. And they can do that, starting now, by releasing those hostages that are held illegally.",1988-10-05,Republican
Woodruff,"Brit Hume, a question for Senator Bentsen.",1988-10-05,Moderator
Bentsen,"Senator, much of the Dukakis and Bentsen campaign of late has been devoted to the notion that Senator Quayle isnt ready for the vice presidency and perhaps the presidency, and certainly nothing that you have said here tonight suggests that you think otherwise. I wonder if you think its really fair for you to advance that view in light of the fact that you ran for the presidency, not the vice-presidency, in 1976 having not yet completed one full term in the Senate and having previously served three terms in the House almost a quarter of a century earlier, when in fact your time in Washington was about equal to what he has now.",1988-10-05,Democrat
Bentsen,"Well, I think what you have to look at is the record of a man who has served his country  (Shouts, laughter)  served his country in war, headed up a squadron in combat, a man who built a business, knew what it was to meet a payroll and create jobs, and then serve in the United States Senate; and one who has been able to bring about some of the kinds of legislation that Ive been able to bring about in my service there. I must say I didnt do a very good job of running for the presidency, and Im well aware of that. But what we are looking at today is trying to judge once again the breadth of experience and the maturity of someone taking on this kind of a task. That is the judgment that has to be exercised by the people of America. Its a presidential decision that you are facing, and a very important one, because we are talking about who is going to lead this country into its future. And you cant have a more important responsibility than that one.",1988-10-05,Democrat
Woodruff,Senator Quayle.,1988-10-05,Moderator
Quayle,"When you look at qualifications, you look at accomplishments as well as experience. And one of the accomplishments Im proudest of is the authorship of the Job Training Partnership Act that has trained and educated and employed over three million young people and adults that are economically disadvantaged. And we did it in a way that we got the private sector to involve itself with the public sector on private industry councils throughout America that serve over the service delivery areas. We have 51 percent of that private industry council that are businessmen and women; we have members of unions; we have community-based organizations; we have education leaders. And what we have been able to do is establish a program that is working, that is putting people back to work. That is an accomplishment, and that is an accomplishment that I will take with me into the White House.",1988-10-05,Republican

Hume,"Senator, I want to ask you a question that may be a little off the subject of politics, but which is aimed to get more at the question of what sort of person you are. I would hope that, Senator Bentsen, if you choose to, you might choose to answer the same question in your rebuttal time. Senator, can you identify any work of literature or art or even of film that you have seen or read or experienced in any way in the last two years that has had a particularly strong effect on you, and tell us why.",1988-10-05,Moderator
Quayle,"In the last six months, I think there are three very important books that I read that have had an impact. The three books are, one, Richard Nixons Victory in 1999, Richard Lugars  Senator Richard Lugars  Letters to the Next President, Bob Masseys Nicholas and Alexandra, which deals with the fall of the Russian empire and the coming of Leninism in 1917. Those three books, which I read over the last spring vacation and early summer, had a very definite impact, because what former President Nixon and Senator Richard Lugar were talking about was a foreign policy as we move toward the 21st century. And the historical book of the downfall of the czar and the coming of Leninism, combining those three books together, gave me a better appreciation of the challenges that we have ahead of us. In Senator Lugars book, he talks about the advancement of human rights around the world; he talked about his leadership effort in the Philippines and South Africa, where we now see human rights advancement on the Reagan agenda. Former President Nixon talked about what we are going to do after detente and arms control, and how we are going to pursue new arms control with the Soviet Union; he talked a little bit about how we deal with the Soviet Union  and this is one of the differences between George Bush and Michael Dukakis, because George Bush understands that to deal with the Soviet Union and to get progress you must deal from a position of strength. And the governor of Massachusetts doesnt understand that. I understand it. And a George Bush administration will pursue that policy.",1988-10-05,Republican

Bentsen,"Well, I think reading Winds of War and Guns of August back to back  I think that really shows you how we make the same mistakes too often, over and over again. And it seems to me that the Senator from Indiana is beginning to do that one. As I look toward our progress thats been made toward disarmament and cutting back on nuclear weapons and see what Ronald Reagan has been able to do with the INF treaty  and I think he deserves great credit with that one. I see a situation where the Senator from Indiana has now jumped off the reservation, when we talk about building on what Ronald Reagan has done and opposes what Ronald Reagan wants to do, the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Secretary of Defense and says lets go slow on further disarmament in trying to get the next treaty. I think thats a mistake. I think that you have to deal with the Russians from strength and we have to understand that you have to have a strong modernized nuclear deterrent, but I think we can make substantial progress and we ought to take advantage. I think hes arrived at a very dangerous judgment in the question of war and peace and it concerns me very much. Because I saw him also try to sabotage the INF treaty when it was on the Floor of the United States Senate with what he was doing there.

Margolis,"I want to go back to the question of qualifications, which I think for most people is more than just how long youve been in the Senate and how long youve been in public life. Theres also a question of candor and of consistency. And several of the things youve said, both here and earlier, I think have raised some reasonable questions. Each of them alone might seem rather trivial, but I think together they create a pattern that needs to be asked. Youve talked a few times today about the Job Training Partnership Act, which you authored. In fact, I believe you co-authored it with another Senator, whom you almost never name. Earlier in the campaign when you were asked why you got a very  a desk job in the National Guard after being trained as a welder, you said at the time you had a very strong background in journalism, which at that time was summer jobs at your family-owned newspaper, which you have not been very forthcoming about what they were. As you have not been very forthcoming about your college record. Now, I have to say  at least the males on this panel have earlier agreed that your record was probably comparable to ours, but  [Laughter.]",1988-10-05,Moderator
Margolis,"Nonetheless, these examples of sort of overstatement and exaggeration and not being forthcoming  this what has led a lot of people to question this part of your qualifications, not your experience, but your character.

Quayle,"Let me start with the underlying premise, that somehow I havent been straightforward. And I have. And lets go to the  right to the very first question  the Job Training Partnership Act. I was the author of that. The co-author in the United States Senate was Senator Kennedy. I was the Chairman of the Employment and Productivity Subcommittee. Chairmen of the committee write that legislation. Chairmen of the committee write the legislation and then they go out and get co-sponsorship. And when you are the chairman of the committee and you sit down and you write the legislation, you are the author of that. And Im proud to have been the author of that. Because you know what we had, we had a CETA program that spent $50 billion from about 1973 through 1982 and when we concluded that program  when we concluded that program, unemployment was higher than when it began. It was a program that didnt work and the Job Training Partnership Act does work.

Senator Quayle has one of the worst voting records in the United States Senate on veterans issues. And one of them that particularly bothers me, sponsoring legislation to put a tax on combat pay and disability pay for veterans, for fighting men and women of America. Tax on their disability pay when theyre lying there in the hospital, people who have sacrificed for our country.

Margolis,"Senator, youre Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee and youre generally considered rather an orthodox conservative on fiscal matters, meaning someone who would be very concerned about the budget deficit. With everybody in politics afraid even to mention taxes, more social security cuts or even very much restrain in defense sending, would you now list a few specific programs which would reduce or eliminate  which you would reduce or eliminate, to cut the deficit by about $50 billion, the deficit which is expected to be about $135 billion this Fiscal Year.",1988-10-05,Moderator
Bentsen,"One of them that Id work on  and I do this as a farmer  I try to turn the situation around where we have seen the subsidy payments go from two and a half billion to ten times that under this administration. And the way I would accomplish thatwas with a tough trade policy, opening up those markets, getting those prices back up to market prices. We can do that if we have an aggressive trade policy for our country, if we make trade a number one priority and not trade it off for some foreign policy objective at the moment. That means we have to stand up for the American farmers and that cuts back on the regulation on American farmers. Thats a positive way to accomplish that. In addition to that, we do some of the things that I think have to be done insofar as doing a better job of procurement, particularly when were talking about some of our military things that we should buy. I know that I fought very hard to put in an independent inspector general for the Defense Department, that the Senator from Indiana opposed me on that. But we were finally able to put that into effect and we saved over a quarter of a billion dollars this year, almost enough to buy a squadron of 716s. Those are the kids of things that Id work on. One of the things I learned in business is that you can expect what you inspect. So, wed be a  doing a much tougher job of auditing, to try to get rid of some of these kickbacks to consultants on military contracts, to be much more aggressive on that. In addition, those types of things would bring the interest rate down. Id try to turn this trade deficit around and that too would help us and help us very substantially. And Id get rid of some things like these planes that  are going to have  that the administration wants thatll fly from New York to Tokyo and take those investment bankers over there in four hours. I dont think we can afford a piece of technological elegance like that. Id strike that sort of thing from the ticket.

Weve reduced the Federal budget deficit $70 billion. Senator Bentsen voted against Gramm-Rudman, the very tool that has been used to bring the Federal budget deficit down. Were going to need all the tools possible to bring this Federal budget deficit down. We need the tools of a line item veto. A line item veto that 43 governors in this country have, but not the President of the United States. The President of the United States needs to have a line item veto. When Congress goes ahead and puts into appropriations bills unrequested and unnecessary spending, let the President put a line through that, send it back to the Congress and let the Congress vote on it again.

Brokaw,"Senator Bentsen, Id like to ask you about your split personality during this election year. Youre running on the ticket with Michael Dukakis, a man who is opposed to the death penalty, a man who is in favor of gun control, and at the same time youre running for the United States Senate in the state of Texas, where your position on many of those same issues is well known, and absolutely opposed to him. How do you explain to the people of Texas how you can be a social conservative on those cutting issues and still run with Michael Dukakis on the national ticket?",1988-10-05,Moderator
Bentsen,"Michael Dukakis wasnt looking for a clone. I think its part of the strength and the character of this land that he reaches out, and that he wants someone that will speak up  and that Ill do. Ive seen many chief executives come into my office and say theyre going over and tell the president of the United States off, theyre going to pound the desk, and go into that office and turn to Jello. Now, Ive dealt with many a president, and I dont hesitate for a minute to speak up. But when youre talking about something like the death penalty, where Michael Dukakis and I do disagree, what you really ought to get to is whats being done against crime, and what kind of progress hes been able to make. In the state of Massachusetts he has the homicide rate down to the lowest of any industrial state. Its substantially ahead of the national average. Hes been able to do that with an educated program for the people of that state by adding some 1,500 new police officers; hes done it in turn by the leadership that I think he will bring to the ticket when he becomes president of the United States and fighting drugs. Hes taken it down some four percent in the high schools of that state, while its gone up about the rest of the nation. But you would seem him as president of the United States being very aggressive in this fight against crime, and having that kind of a successful result. And thats one of the reasons Im delighted and proud to be on the ticket with him. Sure, we have some differences, but overall we have so many things we agree on. This situation of a trade policy, of cutting back on the deficit. Those are positive, plus things, and major issues facing our nation.",1988-10-05,Democrat

Michael Dukakis is the most liberal national Democrat to seek the office of presidency since George McGovern. He is for  he is against the MX missile, the midgetman, cutting two aircraft carriers. He is opposed to many defense programs that are necessary to defend this country. Thats why former Secretary of Defense and former Energy Secretary in the Carter administration, Jim Schlesinger, in an open letter to Time magazine asked Governor Dukakis, are you viscerally anti-military? Jim Schlesinger never got an answer.

The advice that she gave me when I was growing up is advice that Ive given my children, and Ive given to a number of children, number of people. And its very simple. Its very common sense.

Now they have. And theyve educated more than 20,000 of those students, loaned out over a hundred million dollars. And it hasnt cost the taxpayers of this country one cent.

You will have a choice of whether America is going to choose the road of Michael Dukakis or the road of George Bush as we march toward the 21st Century. The road of Michael Dukakis comes down to this: Bigger government, higher taxes. Theyve always believed in higher taxes; they always have, and they always will. Cuts in national defense. Back to the old economics of high interest rates, high inflation, and the old politics of high unemployment. Now the road of George Bush is the road to the future, and it comes down to this: An America second to none, with visions of greatness, economic expansion, tough laws, tough judges, strong values, respect for the flag and our institutions. George Bush will lead us to the 21st Century, a century that will be of hope and peace. Ronald Reagan and George Bush saved America from decline. We changed America. Michael Dukakis fought us every step of the way. Its not that theyre not sympathetic; its simply that they will take America backwards.

Lehrer,"Good evening from the Shiley Theatre at the University of San Diego, San Diego, California. Im Jim Lehrer of the News Hour on PBS. Welcome to this second 1996 presidential debate between Senator Bob Dole, the Republican nominee, and President Bill Clinton, the Democratic nominee. It is sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates. We will follow a town-hall type format tonight. The questions over the next 90 minutes will come from citizens of the greater San Diego area. They were chosen in the past week by the Gallup organization to represent a rough cross section of voters as to political views, age, gender and other factors. Each said he or she is undecided about this presidential race. They were told to come tonight with questions. Nobody from the debate commission or the two campaigns has any idea what those questions are. Neither do I. We will all be hearing them for the first time at the same time. I met with this group three hours ago, and we spoke only about how it was going to work tonight. They are sitting in five sections. I will call on individuals at random, moving from one section to another with each new question, alternating the questions between the two candidates. My job is to keep things fair and the subjects as clear and as varied as possible. The rules, drawn by the campaigns, are basically the same as they were for the Hartford and St. Petersburg debates; 90 second-answers, 60 -second rebuttals, 30-second responses for each question. The candidates are not allowed to question each other directly. There will be two-minute opening and closing statements. The order for this evening was set by coin toss. We begin now with Senator Dole and his opening statement. Senator Dole.",1996-10-16,Moderator

In 20 days, you will help decide who will lead this country into the next century. Its an awesome responsibility. And you must ask yourself, do you know enough about the candidates? You should know as much as possible about each of us. Sometimes the views have been distorted. Theres been millions and millions of dollars of negative advertising spent distorting my views. But I hope tonight you will get a better feel of who Bob Dole is and what hes all about. And I think first you should  I should understand that the question on your mind is do I understand your problem. Would I understand it if it occurred to me, and I might just say Im from a large family. I got lots of relatives and theyre good, average, middle-class, hardworking Americans. They live all across the country. Theyre not all Republicans. Maybe all but one. But in any event, I understand the problems. Whether its two parents working because one has to pay the taxes and one has to provide for the family, whether its a single parent who just barely pays the pressing bills or whether youre worried about an education for your children going to the best schools, or whether youre worried about safe playgrounds, drug-free schools, crime-free schools.

Clinton,"I was going to applaud, too. Well, thank you, Jim. And thanks to the people of San Diego for giving us this opportunity to have another discussion about the decision we all face in front of people who will make the decision. Again, I will say I will do my best to make this a discussion of ideas and issues, not insults. What really matters is what happens to your future and what happens to our country as we stand on the brink of a new century, a time of extraordinary possibility. I have a simple philosophy that I tried to follow for the last four years: Do what creates opportunity for all, what reinforces responsibility from all of us, and what will help us build a community where everybodys got a role to play and a place at the table. Compared to four years ago, were clearly better off. Weve got ten and a half million more jobs, the deficits been reduced by 60 percent. Incomes are rising for the first time in a decade, the crime rates, the welfare rolls are falling, were putting , 100,000 more police on the street. 60,000 felons, fugitives and stalkers have been denied handguns. But that progress is only the beginning. What we really should focus on tonight is what we still have to do to help the American people make the most of this future thats out there. I think what really matters is what we can do to build strong families. Strong families need a strong economy. To me that means we have to go on and balance this budget while we protect Medicare and Medicaid and education and the environment. We should give a tax cut, targeted to child rearing and education, to buying a first home and paying for health care. We ought to help protect our kids from drugs and guns and gangs and tobacco. We ought to help move a million people from welfare to work and we ought to create the finest education system in the world where every 18-year-old can go on to college and all of our younger children have great educational opportunities. If we do those things, we can build that bridge to the 21st century. Thats what I hope to get to talk about tonight. Thank you.",1996-10-16,Democrat

Ms. Mcafee,"Hello, Senator Dole.",1996-10-16,Moderator
Dole,Hi.,1996-10-16,Republican
Ms. Mcafee,"My name is Shannon McAfee. Im a beginning educator in this country, and I really think its important what children have to say. Theyre still very idealistic. And they  everything they say comes from the heart. I have a quote for you from If I Were President, compiled by Peggy Gavin. A sixth grader says, If I were president, I would think about Abraham Lincoln and George Washington and what they did to make our country great. We should unite the white and black people and people of all cultures. Democrats and Republicans should unite also. We should all come together and think of the best ways to solve the economic problems of our country. I believe that when we are able to come together and stop fighting amongst ourselves we will get along a lot better. These are the ideals and morals that we are teach  we are trying to teach our children in these days. Yet we dont seem to be practicing them in our government, in anything. If you are president, how will you begin to practice what we are preaching to our children, the future of our nation?",1996-10-16,Moderator
Dole,"Well, I would say first of all, I think, its a very good question. I appreciate the quote from the young man. Theres no doubt about it that many American people have lost their faith in government. They see scandals almost on a daily basis. They see ethical problems in the Whitehouse today. They see 900 FBI files, private person, being gathered up by somebody in the Whitehouse. Nobody knows who hired this man. So theres a great deal of cynicism out there. But Ive always tried in whatever Ive done is to bring people together. I said in my acceptance speech in San Diego about two months ago that the exits are clearly marked. If you think the Republican party is some place for you to come if youre narrow minded or bigoted or dont like certain people in America, the exits are clearly marked for you to walk out of as I stand here without compromise, because this is the party of Lincoln. I think we have a real obligation, obviously public officials. Im no longer a public official. I left public life on June the 11th of this year. But it is very important. Young people are looking to us. Theyre looking to us for leadership. Theyre watching what we do, what we say, what we promise and what we finally deliver. And I would think, it seems to me that there are opportunities here. When Im President of the United States, I will keep my word. My word is my bond.",1996-10-16,Republican
Lehrer,Mr. President.,1996-10-16,Moderator
Clinton,"One of the reasons that I ran for president, Sandy, is because not just children, a lot of grownups felt that way. And if you remember four years ago, we had not only rising unemployment, but a lot of rising cynicism. I had never worked in Washington as an elected official. It seemed to me that most of the arguments were partisan, Republican, Democrat, left, right, liberal, conservative. Thats why I said tonight Im for opportunity, responsibility and community. And weve gotten some real progress in the last four years. Ive also done everything I could at every moment of division in this country, after Oklahoma City, when these churches were burned, to bring people together and remind people that we are stronger because of our diversity. We have to respect one another. You mentioned Washington and Lincoln. They were presidents at historic times. This is an historic time. Its important we go beyond those old partisan arguments and focus on people and their future. When we do that, instead of shutting the government down over a partisan fight over the budget, were a better country and thats why were making progress now.",1996-10-16,Democrat
Lehrer,Senator.,1996-10-16,Moderator
Dole,"Well, bringing people together, again, is obviously a responsibility we all have. I know you do it. Everybody here does it. You do a lot of things nobody knows about. I have a little foundation for the disabled called the Dole Foundation. Weve raised about $10 million. We dont talk about it. We try to help people with disabilities. Bring them back into the mainstream of public life. So it seems to me that theres also a public trust. When youre the president of the United States, you have a public trust and you have to keep that public trust, as George Washington, as Abraham Lincoln did. And I think now that trust is being violated and it seems to me we ought to face up to it, and the president ought to say tonight that hes not going to pardon anybody that he was involved in business with who might implicate him later on.",1996-10-16,Republican
Lehrer,"All right. The next question from this section right here. Right there in the middle, sir. Yes, sir. DR. BERKLEY: Dr. Robert N. Berkley. Im a cardiologist from Fallbrook, California. Mr. President, I would like to know if you would please explain your plans for  in a substantive fashion for addressing the problems with the health care system in our country.",1996-10-16,Moderator
Clinton,"I will. First of all, let me say what we have done. In the last four years weve worked hard to promote more competition to bring down the rate of inflation in health care costs without eroding health care quality. The government pays for Medicare and Medicaid, as you know, and thats very important. Secondly, weve added a million more children to the ranks of the insured through the Medicaid program. We have protected 25 million people through the passage of the Kennedy-Kassebaum bill that says you can use your health insurance if you change jobs or someone in your family has been sick. We just recently ended those drive-by deliveries saying people cant be kicked out of the hospital by insurance companies when theyve just had babies. So this is, thats a good start. In the next four years, I want to focus on the following things. Number one, add another million children to the insured ranks through the Medicaid program. Number two, keep working with the states, as we are now, to add 2.2 million more people to the insurance system. Number three, cover people who are between jobs for up to six months. That could protect 3 million families, 700,000 kids. Number four, make sure we protect the integrity with the Medicare program and Medicaid program and not do anything in cutting costs which would cause hundreds of hospitals to close which could have been the case if the 270billion dollar Medicare cut that I vetoed, had been enacted in the law.",1996-10-16,Democrat
Dole,"Well, first, let me say there you go again, Mr. President, talking about a Medicare cut. I have heard you say this time after time. I have heard you say on one TV appearance, the media made me do it. You were trying to defend your cut which was not a cut either, Reduction in the growth of spending. Weve always had at least 7 percent. Youve said publicly that its now three times the rate of inflation. We ought to cut the growth to twice the rate of inflation. Its about where we are now. So lets stop talking about cutting Medicare. In my economic plan we increase it 39percent. Dont forget what he tried to do with health care. 17 new taxes, spend 1.5 trillion dollars, 50 new bureaucracies. Can you believe that? You couldnt even have been a cardiologist because he had quotas. Youre a cardiologist, it wouldnt affect you. But if somebody wanted to be a cardiologist, ten years from now, youd have to be certain you complied with some of the rules in this extreme medical plan the government was going to take over for all Americans. There are things we can do like the Kassebaum bill. We changed many provisions I authored, cover preexisting conditions, portability, and there are other things we can do. We still need to cover about 20million people and a lot of children.",1996-10-16,Republican
Clinton,"I dont have time in 30 seconds to respond to fix all that. But let me just say the American Hospital Association said that the budget I vetoed could have closed 700 hospitals. Not me. On a per-person basis, it did cut way below the rate of inflation in medical costs. But the important thing is what are we going to do now? We need to help people who are between jobs. We need to cover more kids. Provide more preventative care. My balanced budget covers mammograms for ladies, women on Medicare and also gives respite care to the million-plus families who have someone with Alzheimers. These things are paid for in the balanced budget plan. Itll move us forward.",1996-10-16,Democrat

Mr. Milligan,"Senator Dole, my name is Jason Milligan, active duty military and small business owner, and my question is: What is your position on closing the gap between military and civilian pay scales?",1996-10-16,Moderator
Dole,"Jason, I appreciate that very much, being a former military man myself. You know, we have 17,000 men and women today wearing our uniform that receive food stamps. It shouldnt happen in America. We have men and women wearing our uniform in substandard housing. It shouldnt happen in America. And its time we take a look at the pay scales. Did get a 3 percent increase this year, but thats not enough. If were going to ask young men and young women to protect us and defend us around the world, and weve had more deployments under this administration than any time in history. Fifty times we deployed troops around the world. Every time you do that you take a risk. Somebody, you know, maybe your son, maybe your grandson, maybe somebody else. But I think anybody who wears a uniform is a great American. Remember Vietnam? Remember when people almost used to walk across the street rather than have a contact with somebody who was in Vietnam? Thats all behind us now, and it should be behind us, and the forgotten war, the Korean War, but I guess I can just answer you very plainly, Jason. Thank you for doing what youre doing. America owes you a debt of gratitude.",1996-10-16,Republican

Mr. Milligan,I have an Amway business.,1996-10-16,Moderator
Clinton,"Good for you. Let me say, if Senator Dole mentioned this, I just signed a bill that we got through Congress to increase the amount of pay increase we could give for military personnel and to make sure the pay increase this year was above the rate of inflation. I also presented to the Congress and they adopted a large package of quality-of-life improvements, which are very important. I spent a lot of time talking to military families as well as military members all over the world and in bases all across the United States, and I became convinced after talking to the families and the personnel in uniform that we needed to not only have the pay raise but we needed to invest more in child care, housing, and other things to support families, especially when there are longer deployments because of the downsizing of the military. So I, were going to do better, and well do better still, but this is a commitment I think that all Americans share without regard to party.",1996-10-16,Democrat
Dole,"I dont disagree with anything that the President said, except he waited four years to do these things, and my view is it ought to be, it will be done on Day 1. Well start working on Day 1 in the Dole- Kemp administration. This is important. We only have ten divisions now. We used to have 18. We had 25 fighter wings. Were down to 13. We had 536 ships. Were down to 336 ships. I mean, weve cut defense spending too much in the first place. The President told you in 92 he would cut it 67 billion. He cut 112 billion dollars, so were right on the edge right now. But the last thing we ought to do is make those who wear the uniforms sacrifice.",1996-10-16,Republican
Lehrer,"Next question here for President Clinton. Yes, maam, here on the front row.",1996-10-16,Moderator
Clinton,"Let me just take two seconds of my time because Im the Commander-in-Chief to respond to one thing that was said. I propose to spend 1.6 trillion dollars on defense between now and the year 2002 and theres less than 1 percent difference between my budget and the Republican budget on defense. Now, on the Middle East, as you know, I worked very hard for peace in the Middle East. The agreement between the Palestinians and the Israelis was signed at the White House and the agreement  the peace treaty with Jordan, I was  I went to Jordan to sign that  to be there. But  and I think the United States can do whatever we reasonably can. I can say this: I do not believe Yassir Arafat wants us to send troops to the West Bank. We have never been asked to send troops to the West Bank. I saw the agreement that Prime Minister Rabin and Yassir Arafat signed on the West Bank. It had 26 separate maps they had to sign, literally thousands of delineations of who would do what on the West Bank, and I believe if the parties will get together and in a good-faith manner make that agreement, that theyll be able to do it if we cannot impose a peace on the Middle East. My position has always been that the job of the United States was to minimize the risks of peace. You know, if they asked me to be part of some monitoring force  as we are in the Sinai and have been since 1978  to monitor the peace between Egypt and Israel, frankly, I would have to think about it. I would have to see what they wanted to do, but I dont believe that will be the request. I think what Mr. Arafat wants us to do is to make sure that everybody honors the agreements theyve already made. Thats why I brought the leaders to Washington a few days ago. I think they will, and I think well get there. Dont be too discouraged.",1996-10-16,Democrat
Dole,"Let me, Jason, come back to you a minute because there is a big difference in the defense budget. We had 7 billion this year and 10 billion more than the president. He puts his money in the outyears, and even if he were re-elected, hed be gone before anything would happen, and nothing is going to happen. We dont have modernization now. If we dont build more B-2 bombers in California and we lost about 500,000 jobs out in California, because of this devastation, these big, big cuts. We had to make cuts. We didnt have the cuts the president promised hed make and then he doubled. I think we need to go back and take a look. Were increasing defense reasonably  not too much, but we are increasing defense some  because we want to be prepared in case somebody here gets called up, Jason. I would say I didnt hear what Yassir Arafat had to say, but I dont want to  you know, I think foreign policy, I want to be very careful about, and Im not here to argue about the President with some ongoing foreign policy matter. What I want the President to do, and I think he may have done it, his last statement, call for an unconditional end of the violence and have the parties keep on talking as they should talk and have a resolution. The last thing we want to do is commit more forces anywhere. But lets sort of keep this out of politics because its pretty dicey right now.",1996-10-16,Republican
Clinton,"When the change of government occurred in Israel, the people of Israel were saying we dont want to abandon the peace process. We want more security. Then a lot of mutual distrust developed. A lot of things happened which maybe shouldnt have happened. When I asked Yassir Arafat and Prime Minister Netanyahu to come to Washington and got them together and they talked alone for three hours, I was convinced that they had to have a chance to make that peace. Again, Id say if they asked us to play some reasonable role, I dont know how I would respond. It would depend entirely on what they asked us to do, but the real secret there is for them to abide by the agreements theyve made and find a way to trust each other, and theyre going to have to spend some time and trust each other. Prime Minister Rabin gave his life believing that that trust could be materialized, and I still think it can be.",1996-10-16,Democrat

Lehrer,Oscar.,1996-10-16,Moderator
Mr. Delgado,"Exsmoker for 30 years. About 30 years ago I was a pack-plus a day man. Okay? You mentioned a statement  you said some time ago that you didnt think nicotine was addictive. Would you care to  are you still holding to that statement, or do you wish to recant or explain yourself?",1996-10-16,Moderator
Dole,"Oh, thats very easy. My record going back to 1965 in the Congress, the first vote we had was whether or not you should put a little notice on cigarettes. They may be danger  I voted I for everything since that time. In fact, 1992 we had a bill come before us that all the states had to comply or theyre going to lose certain money. We sent it to the Clinton Administration for implementation, and they waited three and a half years. And during that period about 3,000 young kids every day started smoking. So you add it up. Thats about three million. Not until again in 1996  I dont want anybody to smoke. My brother probably died partly because of cigarettes. I was asked a technical question. Are they addictive? Maybe they  they probably are addictive. I dont know. Im not a doctor. You shouldnt smoke. You ought to be glad you quit, Oscar, 30 years. And it seems to me what we need to do is to talk about not only tobacco but drugs, because drug use between 12- and 17-year-olds has doubled in this administration in the last 44 months. Marijuana use is up 141percent. Cocaine use up 160 percent. Theyre your kids. Its all happening in this administration because they cut funding and they cut interdiction. When Im President of the United States, were going to use the National Guard and whatever sources we need to stop some of the drugs coming into America. If you stop the drugs, nobody is going to use the drugs; so dont smoke, dont drink, dont use drugs. Just dont do it.",1996-10-16,Republican
Clinton,"Oscar, the question of what the federal government should do to limit the access of tobacco to young people is one of the biggest differences between Senator Dole and me. We did propose a regulation six months after I became President under the law he mentioned. It simply says all these states  it made it illegal for kids to smoke. Now they have to try harder if they want to keep getting federal funds. Then we took comments, as we always do, and there were tens of thousands of comments as to how we ought to do it. Thats what drug it out. Meanwhile, we started the  also in 93 to look into whether cigarettes were addictive enough for the Federal Food and Drug Administration to ban the ability of cigarette companies to advertise, market and distribute their products to our kids. No president had ever taken on the tobacco lobby before. I did. Senator Dole opposed me. He went down and made a speech to people who were on his side saying that I did the wrong thing. I think I did the right thing. On drugs, I have repeatedly said drugs are wrong and illegal and can kill you. We have strengthened enforcement, and everybody in San Diego knows we strengthened control of the border. We have done a lot more, and I hope we get a chance to talk about it.",1996-10-16,Democrat
Dole,"Well, they also know if they live in San Diego, Mr. President, if youre caught with 125 pounds of marijuana or less, you go back to Mexico. Youre not prosecuted. You have a U.S. attorney here that sends `em back home, so I think thats pretty important. Thats a lot of marijuana. Thats a big supply. But dont get into this smoke screen here Oscar. The President in the election year decided I ought to do something, I havent done anything on drugs. Ive been AWOL for 44 months, so lets take on smoking, see they havent even done it. They havent said whats going to happen, whether theyre going to have it declared addictive. Once its a drug, does it apply only to teenagers or everybody in America? Nobody should smoke, young or old, but particularly young people should not smoke, but my record is there. Its been there. Ive voted eight, ten times since 1965.",1996-10-16,Republican
Lehrer,"Next question is for President Clinton. It comes from right here. Yes, sir.",1996-10-16,Moderator
Mr. Fleck,"President Clinton, my name is Jack Fleck. Im retired Air Force pilot. Sir, its officially forecast that our annual Medicare and Social Security deficits are measured in the trillions of dollars next century. Depending on who you listen to, Social Security will be bankrupted in either 2025 or 2030. I feel this is grossly unfair, especially to our younger generation who are losing faith in the system. My question is this: Assuming you agree that our entitlement programs are on an unsustainable course, what specific reforms do you propose?",1996-10-16,Moderator
Clinton,"First of all, there are two different things. Social Security and Medicare are entirely different in terms of the financial stabilities. Lets talk about them separately. Social Security is stable until, as you pointed out, at least the third decade of the next century. But wed like to have a Social Security fund that has about 70 years of life instead of about 30 years of life. What we have to do is simply to make some adjustments to take account of the fact that the baby boomers, people like me, are bigger in number than the people that went just before us and the people that come just after us. And I think what well plainly do is what we did in 1983 when Senator Dole served, and this is something I think he did a good job on when he served on the Social Security commission and they made some modest changes in Social Security to make sure that it would be alive and well into the 21st century. And we will do that. Its obvious that there are certain things that have to be done and there are 50 or 60 different options, and a bipartisan commission to take it out of politics, will make recommendations and build support for the people. Medicare is different. Medicare needs help now. I have proposed a budget which would put ten years on the life of the Medicare trust fund. Thats more than its had a lot of the time in the last years. It would save a lot of money through more managed care, by giving more options, more preventative care and lowering the inflation rate and the prices were paying providers without having the kind of big premium increases and out-of-pocket costs that the budget I vetoed would provide. Then that would give us ten years to do with Medicare what were going to do with Social Security; have a bipartisan group look at what we have to do to save it when the baby boomers retire. But now we can, we ought to pass this budget now and put ten years on it right away so no one has to worry about it.",1996-10-16,Democrat
Dole,"Well again, if youre somebody thinking about the future, I think its fair to say that itll be  well work it out. This is a political year, and the President is playing politics with Medicare. After this year is over, well resolve it just as we did with Social Security in `83. Its a nonpartisan commission. Ronald Reagan got together with Tip ONeill and Howard Baker, two Republicans and one Democrat. They appointed a commission I was on that commission. We resolved, we rescued Social Security. We suggested  I think it has been over a year ago now  we do the same with Medicare, and the White House called it a gimmick. Now last week I guess it was Donna Shalala said well well cut Medicare a hundred billion and appoint a commission. It will probably have to be done by a commission. Take it out of politics. I think if I were a senior citizen I would be a little fed up with all these ads scaring seniors, scaring veterans and scaring students about education. When you dont have any ideas, you dont have any agenda, and all you have is fear, thats all you can use. We have ideas in the Dole-Kemp campaign and we will rescue Medicare as we did Social Security.",1996-10-16,Republican
Clinton,"Their idea was to have the poorest seniors in the country pay $270 more this year. Their idea was a budget that the that the American Hospital Association said could close 700 hospitals. Their idea was to charge everybody more out-of-pocket costs in their budget that I vetoed. Not in an election year, sir. I told them in early 95. Senator Dole said 30 years ago he was one of 12 people who voted against Medicare and he was proud of it. A year ago he said, I was right then. I knew it wouldnt work. American seniors have the highest life expectancy in the world. We need to reform it. Not wreck it.",1996-10-16,Democrat

Ms. Gonzalez,Senator Dole my name is Susan Gonzalez. And I would like to know what you are  what would be your first step in reforming welfare?,1996-10-16,Moderator
Dole,"Well, weve taken the first step. Took it three steps, twice we sent welfare reform to the president and he vetoed it. On the third time we sent welfare reform to the president he signed it but announced he would change it next year, and the vice president said they were going to do something else through the line item veto which Ive never understood, but thats sort of inside baseball. What we need to do is make certain we try to return people to work. And Im standing here as someone who, a long time ago as the county attorney in Russell, Kansas, one of our jobs every month was go through all the welfare checks and sign them. And three of those checks were my grandparents. So I know what its like to have to look welfare head-on. Obviously some people are going to need help. This is the United States of America. Youre not going to go without food and youre not going to go without medical care. This is America. But at the same time, if you want to get off Medicare, get back in the mainstream, were going to provide jobs. Were going to say you have a five-year limit. You can be on welfare. You got two years to look for a job. We provided more money for daycare in the bill that passed the senate, was vetoed, then it came back and the president signed pretty much the same bill. But this is an important issue. I dont think we ought to be giving welfare payments to illegal immigrants. It puts a heavy burden on a state like  except for emergencies. It puts a heavy burden on a states like California. It costs California taxpayers 3 billion dollars a year.",1996-10-16,Republican

Dole,Let me get out of your way here.,1996-10-16,Republican
Clinton,"Its illegal right now and has been for years for illegal immigrants to get welfare benefits. Let me say that this is one of the most important issues in the world to me. I started working on welfare reform in 1980 because I was sick of seeing people trapped in a system that was increasingly isolating them and making their kids more vulnerable to get in trouble. So Ive been working on it when I was a governor for a long time. When I became president I used the authority I had in this law to get out from certain federal rules to help states move people to work. We reduced the welfare rolls by 2 million already. Now, Ive got a plan with this new welfare reform law to work with the private sector, to give employees specific tax incentives to hire people off welfare, and to do some other things which will create more jobs in the private sector, at least a million, and move more people from welfare to work. Its very important. And I hope we get a chance to talk about this more. Theres not a more important issue. I, I still remember a woman that I met ten years ago who said she wanted to get off welfare so her kids could tell, give an answer when they say, What does your mother do for a job? I met that woman again. Shes got four kids. Ones got a good job, ones studying to be a doctor. Ones in technical school, ones an honor student in high school. I want to make more people like that woman, Lily Harden, so Ive got a plan to do it, and its just beginning.",1996-10-16,Democrat
Dole,"Well another thing we can do. We talk about growth. Weve got a great economic package which I hope we will discuss later. Across-the-board tax cut. Child credits. $500 per child under 18. Reduce the capital gains rate. Create more jobs and opportunities for people on and off welfare. We have other provisions. Less litigation. The trial lawyers, big supporters of the president. The trial lawyers, of course they like lawsuits, so every time they have a bill that they want vetoed, the president vetoes it for them. Weve got to understand in America that weve got to have growth, create more jobs and more opportunities in the private sector. The president takes credit for all these people off welfare. The governors did that. Federal government doesnt do that. And the government doesnt create jobs. Theyre created in the private sector.",1996-10-16,Republican

Ms. Johnson,"Mr. President. My name is Pamela Johnson and Im a landlord. My question is, does your party have any future plans to reduce the capital gains tax, especially for retired Americans?",1996-10-16,Moderator
Clinton,"First of all, we have a big plan to reduce the capital gains tax when people sell their homes. Part of my tax package which is paid for in my balanced budget plan would exempt up to half a million dollars in gains from people when they sell their homes, which I think is the biggest capital gains benefit we could give to most ordinary Americans. We also have capital gains now for people that invest in new small businesses and hold the investment for five years. It was part of our other economic plan. And these are things I think that will go a long way toward helping America build a stronger economy and a better tax system. I think the most important thing to emphasize, though, is that we also have to help people in other ways to build a strong economy and we cant have any tax cut thats not paid for. One of the big differences between Senator Dole and myself is that I told you how Im going to pay for every penny of the tax cuts I recommend and weve worked hard to bring this deficit down and thats helped people in the real estate business because the interest rates are lower. Weve got home ownership at a 15-year high. Weve got this country going in the right direction. So we can have a tax cut but my priority would be to help the families who need it with child rearing and education and buying a first-time home and helping for health care costs. So from your business, helping in buying a first-time home, exempting the capital gains on the sale of the home would be the most important things that you asked about. Thank you, Pamela.",1996-10-16,Democrat
Lehrer,Senator Dole.,1996-10-16,Moderator
Dole,"Pam, what the president didnt tell you is all his tax cuts expire the year 2000, but these increases go on forever. Thats the liberal approach. You know, give you a little tax cut, give you a couple of years, then make the tax increases go on forever. So the net tax increase in his plans somewhere between 60 and 80 billion dollars. We have in the Dole-Kemp economic plan, unless unless your homes worth over 500,000 dollars. And if it is, I appreciate it congratulate you. But in any event, no tax. Its a good idea, they saw it, they picked it up and put it in theirs, but its only temporary. Ours are permanent, ours is a good plan. Create jobs and opportunities. Capital gains rate, cut it in half, cut it 28 percent to 14 percent. There are 7 trillion dollars in assets locked up in America. If we cut the capital gains rate, Im told everyday, I had a letter from a former constituent in Kansas saying I want to sell property in California, put it in my business in Kansas, I cant, because the capital gains rates too high. We need to get the economy going. Thatll help social security. Thatll create more jobs. Thatll help people who want to get off welfare. Its the American way.",1996-10-16,Republican
Clinton,"Before Senator Dole left the Senate, he and Mr. Gingrich also were recommending that we pass these tax cuts only insofar as we could pay for them. We all assume that the tax cuts will be permanent. But we have to prove we can pay for them. After he left the senate, we abandoned that. Thats why most experts say that this tax scheme will blow a huge hole in the deficit, raise interest rates and weaken the economy and that will take away all the benefits of the tax cut with a weaker economy. Thats why we have to balance the budget, and I will tell you how Im going to pay for anything I promise you, line by line. You should expect that from both of us.",1996-10-16,Democrat

Ms. Naudin,"My name is Melissa Naudin. Im a third-year student at UC, San Diego. I just want to say its a great honor representing the voices of America. My voice, my question is concerning you, Mr. Dole. All the controversy regarding your age. How do you feel you can respond to young voices of America today and tomorrow?",1996-10-16,Moderator
Dole,"Well, I think age is very  you know, wisdom comes from age, experience and intelligence. And if you have some of each  and I have some age, some experience and some intelligence  that adds up to wisdom. I think it also is a strength. Its an advantage. And I have a lot of young people work in my office, work in my campaign. This is about America. This is about, somebody said earlier, one of the first questions, were together. Its one America, one nation. Im looking at our economic plan because Im concerned about the future for young people. Im looking about drugs. The president has been AWOL for four years. Im looking about crime. Hell claim credit now for crime going down, but it happens because mayors and governors and others have brought crime down. Rudy Giuliani, Mayor of New York, brought crime down 25 percent just in New York City. Of course the president will take credit for that. My view is we want to find jobs and opportunities and education. This year the Republican Congress, as far as student loans went from 24 billion to 36 billion over the next six years. A 50 percent increase. The highest appropriation. 6 billion dollars for Pell Grants, very, very important. We also raised the amount of each Pell Grant. In our economic plan, the $500 child credit can be used for young people, rolled over and over and over, you, of course not this age, but if you have a child two years old, 7 percent interest would be worth about $18,000 by the time that child was ready for college.",1996-10-16,Republican

Dole,You tried it last time you ran.,1996-10-16,Republican
Clinton,"Tell him you can have everything you got. And so let me just say this. Did you hear him say that Congress just voted to increase student loans and scholarships? They did after he left. The last budget he led cut Pell Grants, cut student loans. I vetoed it when they shut the government down. My plan would give students a dollar-for-dollar reduction for the cost of a typical community college tuition. A $10,000 deduction a year for the cost of college tuition. We let families save in an IRA, withdraw tax free to pay for the cost of education and its all paid for. My whole administration is about your future. Its about what the 21st century is going to be like for you. I hope you will look at the ideas in it. Thank you.",1996-10-16,Democrat
Dole,"When you dont have any ideas, I guess you say the other persons ideas are old. As I said earlier, they dont have any ideas. Their ideas is to raise taxes and spend more money. Thats the liberal philosophy. Thats what you like, youve got a perfect candidate. President Clinton came to California in 1992. He said the centerpiece in my first four years is going to be a middle class tax cut. Now all you got that tax cut, congratulations. Because you got a big tax increase. You got a 265 billion dollar tax increase. And he stands here and says politicians who make promises like that ought to be ignored. Well he made the promise. I keep my word, and you will have a tax cut. It will help you in whatever youre going to do in the next few years. Thank you.",1996-10-16,Republican

Clinton,"No, maam, I dont. I am against quotas. Im against giving anybody any kind of preference for something theyre not qualified for. But because I still believe that there is some discrimination and that not everybody has an opportunity to prove theyre qualified, I favor the right kind of Affirmative Action. Ive done more to eliminate Affirmative Action programs I didnt think were fair and tighten others up than my predecessors have, since affirmative actions been around. But I have also worked hard to give people a chance to prove that they are qualified. Let me just give you some examples. Weve doubled the number of loans from the small business administration, tripled the number of loans to women business people, no one unqualified, everybody had to meet the standards. Weve opened 260,000 new jobs in the military to women since Ive been president. But the joint chiefs say were stronger and more confident and solid than ever. Let me give you another example of what I mean. To me, Affirmative Action is making that extra effort. Its sort of like what Senator Dole did when he sponsored the Americans with Disabilities Act and said to certain stores, okay, you have to make it accessible to people in wheelchairs. We werent guaranteeing anything, anybody anything except the chance to prove they were qualified, the chance to prove that they could do it. And thats why I must say I agree with General Colin Powell that were not there yet. We ought to keep making those extra effort Affirmative Action programs, the law and the policy of the land.",1996-10-16,Democrat
Lehrer,Senator Dole.,1996-10-16,Moderator
Dole,"Well, we may not be there yet but were not going to get there by giving preferences and quotas. I supported that route for some time and again I think it gets back to experience. A little experience, a little age, a little intelligence. And I noted that nobody was really benefitting except a very small group at the top. The average person wasnt benefitting. People who had the money were benefiting. People who got all the jobs were benefiting. It seems to me that we ought to support the California civil rights initiative. It ought to be not based on gender or ethnicity or color. Or disability. Im disabled. I shouldnt have a preference. I would like to have one in this race, come to think of it, but I dont get one. Maybe we can work that out. I get a 10-point spot. This is America. No discrimination. Discrimination ought to be punished but there ought to be equal opportunity. We ought to reach out, make certain everybody has a chance to participate. Equal opportunity. But we cannot guarantee equal results in America. Thats not how America became the greatest country on the face of the earth.",1996-10-16,Republican
Clinton,"I have never supported quotas. Ive always been against them. I dont favor equal results, but I do favor making sure everybody has a chance to prove theyre competent. The reason I have opposed that initiative is because Im afraid it will end those extra effort programs. Again I say, think of the Americans with Disabilities Act. Make an effort to put a ramp up there so someone in a wheelchair can get up. You dont guarantee they get the job. You guarantee they have a chance to prove theyre competent. And as I said, this is not a partisan thing with me. General Colin Powell said the same thing, he fears the initiative would take away the extra effort programs. No preferences to unqualified people, no quotas, but dont give up on making an extra effort until youre sure everybody has a chance to prove theyre qualified.",1996-10-16,Democrat

Mr. David,Tim.,1996-10-16,Moderator
Dole,"I first want to say the President didnt quite give you all of the stuff on the quotas, because the Justice Department had what we called the Piscataway case up in New Jersey. Its pretty clear that was a quota case, and just because one teacher was white and one black and they had the same qualifications, you know they decided who would stay there. It shouldnt be that way. Now, the President can say well he wants to mend it, not end it. There are 168 federal programs that allow quotas. He ended one. Now, this economic package, Tim, Im glad you asked, because you look like the type that might be able to benefit from a 15 percent across- the-board tax cut and $500-per-child tax credit, or  you know, estate tax relief which youre not interested in right now, but capital gains rate reduction. If youre taking care of an elderly parent, you get a $1,000 deduction. We think thats very important because a lot of people take care of their parents. How do we pay for it? You can have a constitutional amendment to balance the budget, which the President opposed and defeated. He twisted arms and got six Democrats to vote with him and lost by one vote. Were going to balance the budget, by the year 2002. The President wants to spend 20 percent more in the next six years, and I want to spend 14 percent more and give that 6 percent back to the people. Remember, its your money; its not his money. And its not my money. Its your money. And you shouldnt have to apologize for wanting to keep all you can of it. But he ought to apologize for wanting to take more and more. He wants to give you sort of a government tax cut, which really doesnt mean anything.",1996-10-16,Republican
Clinton,"You know, one of the responsibilities of growing older, it seems to me, is being able to tell people something they may not want to hear just because its true. When they had a 250 billion dollar tax scheme, that is half the size of this one. This one is 550. They passed the budget. They have 270 billion dollars in Medicare cuts the first education cuts in history, cut environmental enforcement by 25 percent, took away the guarantee of quality standards in nursing homes, took away the guarantee of health care for folks with disabilities. Dont take my word for this. The Economist magazine polled lots of economists, seven Nobel prize winners who said if this tax scheme passes, it will require huge cuts, 40 percent, in the environment and law enforcement and education. It will require bigger cuts in Medicare than I vetoed last time. My targeted tax cut is for child-rearing, buying a first-time home, paying for health care costs. And its paid for, and Ill tell you how Ill pay for it. He wont tell you because he cant.",1996-10-16,Democrat
Dole,"Your targeted tax cut, Mr. President, never hits anybody. Thats the problem with it. Nobody ever gets it. But I must say Im a little offended by this word scheme. You talked about it last time, you talked about a risky scheme and Vice President Gore repeated it about ten times in St. Petersburg. If I have anything in politics, its my word. My colleagues, Democrats and Republicans, will tell you that Bob Dole kept his word. Im going to keep my word to you. Im going to keep my word to the American people. Were going to tax  cut taxes and balance the budget. Were not going to touch Medicare. Its going to grow 39 percent, and Social Security is going to grow 34 percent.

Mr. Burns,"My name is Duane Burns. Im a martial arts instructor and a father. Mr. President, could you outline any plans you have to expand the Family Leave Act?",1996-10-16,Moderator
Clinton,"Thank you, well, first let me say that I signed the Family Leave Act. It was my very first bill, and Im very proud of it because it symbolizes what I think we ought to be doing. I dont take credit for all the good things that have happened in America, but I take credit for what Ive tried to do to work with others to make good things happen. Most important good things that happen in America happen in families. Just about every family I know, the main concern is how am I going to succeed at work and still do right by my children. Family medical leave has let 12 million families take a little time off for the birth of a child or a family illness without losing their job. Id like to see it expanded in two ways. Id like to say you can also take a little time off without losing your job to go to a regular parent-teacher conference or to go to a regular doctors appointment with a family member. Id also like to see the overtime laws change so that we could have some more flex time so that at the discretion of the worker, the worker, if you earn overtime, you could decide when you want that time to be taken, in cash or in time with your family if youve got a family problem. I never go anywhere, it seems like, where I dont meet somebody who has benefited from a Family Leave Law. In Longview, Texas the other day, I met a woman who was almost in tears because she had been able to keep her job while spending time with her husband who had cancer. One of the people whos here with me today met a woman in the airport saying her son, Jess was able to be present at the birth of her child because of the Family Leave Law. So yes, I think it should be expanded. We have to help people succeed at home and at work.",1996-10-16,Democrat
Dole,"Well, 88 percent of the people  the President claims 11 million are already covered and only 5 percent  keep in mind only 5 percent of the employers are affected by the Family Leave Act. We had a better idea. We didnt win. We had a better idea. Now we have a majority and we get a president. That was a tax credit for the employer. Instead of the federal government, we had that tax credit, pick up some of the costs, because if you have to hire a replacement worker, thats a cost. This is the way it ought to work, give more power back to the states and back to the people back to the taxpayers, not always the long arm of the federal government. But keep in mind this bill covers 5 percent of the employers, and 95 percent of the employers and all those employees they employ are not covered in this act. And according to Investors Daily, which I read just a couple of days ago, 88 percent of the people he claims credit for are already covered in collective bargaining agreements or other agreements. We had family leave in our office, Im certain. I see my friend Senator Mitchell. He had family leave. I work every day with people. I spend a lot of time in hospitals. I know what its like to be in a hospital. Sure we want family leave. But theres a better way to do it.",1996-10-16,Republican
Clinton,"I only have 30 seconds. I cant fix the statistics. It covers the majority of the work force. Employers of under 50 are exempted. The bill originally covered employers of 25 and more, but because of opposition, we went up to 50. Senator Dole led the opposition to it. He filibustered it. He said it was a mistake. He said it would hurt the economy. Weve had record numbers of new small businesses and 10 and a half million jobs. It didnt hurt the economy. He still believes its a mistake. I believe its right.

How would you help this problem out?",1996-10-16,Moderator
Dole,"Well, right. Weve lost 357,000 manufacturing jobs. The Bureau of Labor Statistics today said they made a mistake. Its probably going to take a much, much higher figure. So we talk about all these new jobs. Wed better wait and see what the results are. Were going to do that with a more aggressive trade policy. Were going to do that with an economic package. Were going to do that with regulatory reform. You know, regulations cost the average family right here, Democrat or Republican, about $7,000 a year. 7,000. Thats like a tax. Its put a lot of people out of business. I met a lady in Colorado Springs about seven weeks ago now. She had a small business with 63 employees. She finally gave it up. Why? Because of paperwork and regulation. Congress passed a paperwork reduction act. The President exempts the IRS which creates three-fourths of the paperwork. Were going to have regulatory  were gonna have litigation reform. You know, I fell off a platform out in California, Chico, a while back. Before I hit the ground, my cell phone rang and this trial lawyer said, I think weve got a case here. (Laughter). Weve got to stop some of these frivolous lawsuits. Theyre putting people out of business, men and women. Get the economy going, cut the capital gains rate, create more jobs and opportunities for everybody in America. Thats what we will do. And my word is good. I keep my promises. I dont break my promises after the election, and I dont make new promises in an election year. Were going to get it done. Were going to grow some of these jobs in America, because we need to get it  theyre going the wrong way.",1996-10-16,Republican
Clinton,"Lets look at the facts. We lost a lot of manufacturing jobs in the 12 years before I became President. Weve gained manufacturing jobs since Ive been President. Weve negotiated over 200 separate trade agreements. Lets just take California. In California, we made 37 billion dollars worth of telecommunications equipment eligible for export for the first time. Were selling everything from from  from telephones to CDs to rice in Japan. Were selling American automobiles in Japan now. I visited a Chrysler dealership in Japan. Were No.1 in automobile manufacturing production and sales around the world again, the first time since 1970s. Why? Because weve had tough aggressive trade policies, and because weve got interest rates down. We have a good, stable economic policy. Because we reduced the deficit four years in a row. For the first time in the 20th century the President has done that in all four years and thats why I dont want to see us blow a big hole in the deficit with a tax program we cant pay for, so your interest rates will go up, and youll have to pay back in higher interest rates what you allegedly will get in a tax cut, so I say keep working on expanding the markets. More than half of these 10 and a half million new jobs are in higher wage areas and well have more manufacturing and sales around the world.",1996-10-16,Democrat

Hiring people temporarily who have lost their jobs and they get to work for 30 days or 60 days. Thats a good economy? I dont think so. Theyre setting new records this year. We had the worst economy in a century. We had the slowest growth, about 2.5 percent. The president inherited growth of over 5 percent. We dont have the S&L crisis anymore.

I believe that any law- abiding, tax-paying citizen who shows up in the morning and doesnt break the law and doesnt interfere with his or her neighbors ought to have the ability to work in our country and shouldnt be subject to unfair discrimination. Im for it. Now, I have a little time left so let me just say that I get attacked so many times on these questions; its hard to answer these things. Senator Dole just said we had the worst economy in the century. In February he said we had the best economy in  30 years, just February. And I dont want to respond in kind to all these things. I could. I could answer a lot of these things tit for tat. But I hope we can talk about what were going to do in the future. No attack ever created a job or educated a child, or helped a family make ends meet. No insult ever cleaned up a toxic waste dump or helped an elderly person. Now, for four years thats what I worked on.

I dont have any policy against hiring anyone; whether its lifestyle or whatever, we dont have any policy of that kind, never have had in my office or will we have in the future. But as far as special rights, Im opposed to same-sex marriages, which the President signed well after midnight one morning in the dark of night. I opposed it. But I will get back to the economic package because, again, I think this is very important. If theres anything thats going to change America its get the economy growing. The President inherited a good economy, sure the S&L crisis then were selling assets. Got a Republican Congress cutting spending finally and he said its the best four years ever. Thats not true. We had a 1.2 million bankruptcy, set a new record. Credit card debt has never been higher. I just told you about this manufacturing job loss which is going to increase.

Dole,Thank you.,1996-10-16,Republican
Ms. Strategos,"Being in health care  we have talked about a little bit about health care tonight, but mainly Medi-Cal and Medicare have been mentioned, but the private sector is a problem. Managed care is taking over, especially in California. And because of that, the quality of care is going downhill. There are many, many people who cannot get the tests that they need when they need them, and because of that, they are dying needlessly. There are many, many more lawsuits being presented against the managed care industry because of this. And I think its a real problem that needs to be addressed. What would you do if you were president?",1996-10-16,Moderator
Dole,"Well, one thing I did was oppose the government takeover health care that President Clinton offered in 1993, which created 17 new taxes and 50 new bureaucracies and price controls, because we were afraid the very thing you mentioned would have happened. Everybody would have been forced into managed care. You couldnt have chosen your own doctor and that would have been the end. And I think right now we got to go back. I know theyve appointed a commission to take a look at managed care. Maybe thats part of the answer. But it seems to me if we start to take choices away from people and if we drive them into one type care, eliminate fee-for-service altogether or eliminate the fact you can go to your own doctor, you have to go somewhere else, then I think weve taken a giant step backward in the United States of America. We have the best health care delivery system in the world and we want to keep it that way. Thats why we opposed the government take over health care plan that President Clinton tried and tried and tried to get through Congress. Didnt get it done. And ended up we had more votes than he had, then they decided to pull the plug. It was a big, big mistake. Now whether or not hell do that again Ive heard some of the people say, well, thats the model we ought to use and if hes reelected maybe he will come back and try it again. I hope not. I hope not in both cases. But it does seem to me that youve raised a very important point that needs to be addressed. Youre going to have to watch it. Gonna have to take a look at all the managed care going on in California, or were going to end up losing our best care that we have in the world.",1996-10-16,Republican

Dole,Two.,1996-10-16,Republican
Clinton,"Well, one of the things that I tried to do was to make sure that everybody in the country who was under a managed care plan should at least have three choices of plans, and would have the right to get out without penalty every year. Now thats not a government takeover. Thats like the family of medical-leave law; it just tries to set the rules of the game. Im strongly in favor of a federal bill to repeal any gag rules on providers. In other words, I believe that doctors should not be able to be kicked out of managed care plans just because they tell the patients what they need and what more expensive care options might be. If were saving money and managing resources better, thats a good thing. If were saving money and depriving people of care, thats a bad thing. A good place to start is to say no managed care provider can gag a doctor and kick the doctor out of the managed care plan for the doctor, telling the patient, you need a more expensive test, you need a more expensive procedure, your health requires it.",1996-10-16,Democrat

If that isnt a liberal idea, Ive never heard one. 17 new taxes, price controls, 50 new bureaucracies. Wed have that trouble all over America. We need to deal with managed care.

Ms. Oconnor,"I would sort of like  Colleen OConnor. I teach history and political science in San Diego Mesa College right up the road here. And I would like to tee off from the original question by another teacher and speak for those people that arent here tonight. 63 percent of the American people are not participating that are eligible to vote, not even participating in the process. Several parties cant even get in the debate; the Green Party, the Reform Party, the Natural Law Party, all of these people are basically opted out of what were still participating in. If we in fact are going to bring the country back together and be all faces around the table, the new American family, what do you see as something the president can do to begin that process to bring them back in?",1996-10-16,Moderator
Clinton,"First of all, I think its important to make voting more accessible. Thats why I strongly supported the Motor Voter law. There was a big story I think in U.S.A. Today of the millions of people who have now registered because of it. Secondly, I think we need to look at making the elections more accessible. You know several states now are letting people vote over three weeks. A lot of people are busy and its hard for them to just get there and vote. Third thing I think we need is more forums like this, which is one of the reasons I have so strongly supported campaign finance reform. Because if you want to cut the cost of campaigns, you have to open the airways, because what drives the cost of campaigns are the cost of advertising on television, radio, newspaper, mass mailing. And if you open the airways to more things like this, you see its not just you that are participating here. For every one of you who stood up here and asked a question tonight, I promise you theres a 100,000 Americans who said I wish I could have asked that question. So I think we have to change the nature of politics. The last thing I think we should do is something I have been trying to do since I have been president, is every time I do something in a public way, I try to have a real American citizen there who is directly affected by it so that people can see the connection of what happens way across the country, in Washington with more police on the street, in San Diego, clean up the sewage here in San Diego, doubling the border guards here in Southern California, that there is a connection between what we do way back there and what we do here. Those are my best ideas about it.",1996-10-16,Democrat
Dole,"Well, I dont know of any perfect solution. I have been in politics for some time, and I worry about the people who dont vote. And I wonder if its our fault, the candidates fault. People say, I dont care. One vote doesnt make a difference. I can give you hundreds of  you can probably give me 200 cases where one vote made a difference. I know it made a lot of difference many times in the Congress. Campaign finance might help. It might help the contributions from coming in from Indonesia or other foreign countries, rich people in those countries, and then being sent back after the L.A. Times discovers it, $250,000. But maybe there ought to be more debates. I would be willing to have another debate this year. We can invite all the candidates. And talk about the economy. If we dont get the economy to grow, if we dont cut taxes, and give people child credits, and cut the capital gains rate, and get this economy growing, were going to limp into the next century. If we grow the economy its going to help Social Security. Its going to help jobs. Its going to help everything.",1996-10-16,Republican
Clinton,"Let me make one other suggestion, because youre a teacher, you can have an impact on that. One of the things I think that really frustrates people is that so often political campaigns seem to be more about the politicians that are running than the people. And there is a connection. And I think what we have to do is convince people there is a big difference, if you vote one way you will have a Department of Education in the 21st century, if you vote the other way, you wont. If you vote one way you will have an expansion of family leave. If you vote the other way, you will be lucky to save it. But these are important questions. And people have to decide.

Ms. Siefert,"Iris. Senator Dole, we talked about Social Security for us baby boomers. But shouldnt we be saving and investing for our own retirement as well? Are you planning any incentives to encourage us to take care of ourselves rather than to rely on the government and on Social Security when we retire?",1996-10-16,Moderator
Dole,"Well, we have in our economic pack,  individual retirement accounts where we think it will encourage savings. You can also use those accounts for health care or education or a first home. Were doing that precisely, and I think one thing sooner or later were going to have to consider is take a look at the Social Security system. Because weve got a lot of people advocating we dont want to put our money into Social Security. You have to be very careful of that because you have to protect the people who are already in the pipeline. Its something you might consider. Im not suggesting it will be done, but at least we ought to look at it. Its been looked, When I was chairman of the finance committee which handled Social Security we looked at all these options, and one thing weve got to make certain, when I used to go home my mother would tell me all Ive got is my Social Security, dont touch it. And we didnt touch it. We preserved it. And Im an optimist. Your your Social Security is going to be there when you retire. We will fix it. It will probably happen in the year 2012 or 2015. In 1983 we thought we had a 75 -year fix. It didnt work. Much, much less, but at least we fixed it for some time and 37 to 40 million people get their checks on time. So we need to preserve the system. And we need to make it stronger. But we also need to look at some options, whether or not we  depending on what the options are. In fact, they have got a commission right now in Congress, a bipartisan commission, looking at all the different options they will present to the next Congress. so I think we will wait, see what they present, take a look at it.",1996-10-16,Republican
Clinton,"Iris, this is one where we have some agreement, I think. Only about half the people in this country have pension plans. And Social Security is not enough for a lot of people to live on, or at least is not enough for them to maintain anything like their previous lifestyle. So weve got to figure out how are we going to have more people with pension plans, and pension coverage has been declining as more and more people work for small businesses and fewer people work for big businesses. So what, what is in my plan and I think its almost identical in Senator Doles plans is we make more people eligible to save in an IRA and let couples, married couples save more and then they could withdraw from it tax-free if they needed to, for medical emergencies or buy a home or education, but they could also save to supplement retirement. In addition to that, we just passed a sweeping small business reform that makes it easier for small business people to take out 401 K plans for themselves and employees and much easier for employees to carry it from job to job. My best friend from grade school is a computer software salesman and he told me last time he changed employers it took him nine months to figure out how to transfer his 401K plan. Now none of that will happen anymore. I hope over the next ten years you will see a big increase over the percentage of people that have pension plans, plus a secure Social Security system.",1996-10-16,Democrat

Stop some of this senseless litigation and let people work in America. And I think thats thats the thrust we will make. Obviously if Social Security is a very important program, it should  it will be preserved. Democrats or Republicans, it will be preserved. We want to make certain we protect those in the pipeline just as we did back in 1983 and we did it on a bipartisan basis. We took it out of politics. people get so tired of politics.

Mr. Smith,Good evening. Im Michael Smith. Im an electronics technician in the Navy. My question was how you plan to deal with the trade deficit with Japan.,1996-10-16,Moderator
Clinton,"Let me tell you what we have done. We have concluded with Japan 21  about to be 22  trade agreements now. And since we did that, in the areas where we concluded, trade agreements or exports to Japan have gone up by 85 percent in the last four years and our trade deficit with Japan has gone down. Until about five months ago the Japanese economy was in a deep recession. Its coming back now, so they can buy even more American products, and I think it will go down more. But Im very  thats one of the real success stories here of the work weve done. Were selling Japanese rice from California for the first time. I visited a Chrysler dealership in Tokyo. I visited a Jeep plant, oldest plant in America, a plant in Toledo, Ohio, where theyre going to export 41,000 right hand drive Jeeps this year, and theyve got 700 new jobs because of it. Theres no easy way to do this when youre dealing with an economy thats traditionally been more closed than one thats traditionally been more open. You have to gut it out, issue by issue by issue. We agreed in principle on an insurance agreement, and were working on three or four other areas now, but the way you have to do it is make sure youre competitive. Were the most competitive country in the world now, and then just fight to open those markets and go try to make the sale, and thats what our trade ambassador our commerce secretary and all the other people in our administration are trying to do.",1996-10-16,Democrat
Dole,"Well, the bottom line is we have to stop exporting jobs here. There are 357, 000 good jobs  manufacturing jobs, which are lost. And I assume some of those are because of our trading partners. We didnt have access to their markets. We ought to insist on access. If we dont have access to their markets the same way theyve access our markets, we ought to say, Wait, thats enough. Time out. When you give us access, well give you access. Its very hard to get into the Japan market, as everybody knows. They want to get into our market. They sell a lot of automobiles here, create a lot of jobs  those who sell exports. And thats very important to the economy, but I think we want to make certain. I supported the Presidents trade policy. But we got to be more aggressive. Once you have a policy, then you have to go out and be aggressive and enforce that policy. There are American jobs that are being lost. This is what Ross Perot complains about. And Id say to the Reform party, take a look at the Republican party. Were the reform party, and were going to make things better, and one of the things were going to do is stop exporting jobs.",1996-10-16,Republican
Clinton,"Let me say again, weve had over 200 separate trade agreements in the last four years. By far, the largest number in American history  not just the big ones you read about, but a lot of smaller ones. And now what we have to do is to focus on those things were real good at and make sure were getting a fair deal. We just had a pretty serious dispute with China because they were copying our CDs, and costing thousands of jobs in places like California. So we have  as we said, if you want to keep doing business and selling your products over here, youre going to have to quit pirating our CDs, and they agreed to do things and verify that they had done it, which will make the problem much better. There is not a simple answer. You have to work on this day in and day out, every month ,every year, every issue, to make sure that we have not only free trade but fair trade. Im proud that were better off on that than we were four years ago.",1996-10-16,Democrat

In addition to what you mentioned, they also were concerned about this all-powerful central government in Washington, D.C., thatd in effect confiscate your property, so  I carry it in my pocket  I cant pull it out or Id violate the rules  a copy of the Tenth Amendment which says we ought to return power to the states and the people, the people here. You ought to make more decisions. Honor, duty, and country, thats what America is all about. Certainly the President of the United States, the highest office in the world, the most important office in the world, has a responsibility to young people, as we talked about earlier. To everyone. By example. And when it comes to public ethics, he has a responsibility. And you have 30-some in your administration, either left or being investigated or in jail or whatever, then youve got an ethical problem. This is public ethics; Im not talking about private ethics. Talking about public ethics. When you have 900 files gathered up by some guy who is a bouncer in a bar and hired a security officer to collect files, in Watergate  I know a person who went to jail for looking at one file, one FBI file.

Clinton,"This is the most religious, great country in history. And yet, interestingly enough, we have the most religious freedom of any country in the world, including the freedom not to believe. And now we have all these people just up the road in Los Angeles County, we have people from 150 different racial and ethnic groups and tons of different religions, but the fundamental tenets of virtually every religion are the same, and what I try to do is to support policies that would respect religion and then help parents inculcate those values to their children. Let me very briefly give you some examples. One of my proudest moments was signing the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, that says the government has got to bend over backwards before we interfere with religious practice. So I changed the Justice Departments effort to get a church to pay back a man tithe, because he was bankrupt when he gave it. I have supported character education programs in our schools, drug-free schools programs. I supported giving parents a V-chip on their television so if they dont want their young kids to watch things they shouldnt watch, they wouldnt have to.

I heard Mr. Dole say several times all of us together, and when he was asked if he would support equal rights and employment for gay and lesbian people, you said that you favored that, and he said that he did not believe in special rights. And I thought the question was equal rights for all people. And I dont understand why people are using the term special rights when the question is equal rights. Could you help me in understanding that?",1996-10-16,Moderator
Clinton,"I want to answer your question, but let me say one other thing. We dont need a constitutional amendment for kids to pray, and what I did was to have the justice department and the education department for the first time ever issue a set of guidelines that we gave to every school in America, saying that children could not be interfered with in religious advocacy when they were praying, when they were doing whatever they could do under the constitution, just because they were on a public school ground, and I think anyone whos experienced this will tell you that our administration has done more than any in years to clarify the freedom of religion in the public square, including in the public schools. Now, I think I have to let Senator Dole speak for himself. It wouldnt be fair for me to do that. I would wind up  I mean, its the last question and I would mischaracterize it to try to make you happy. Let me tell you what I feel. We have a lot of differences in our country, and some of us believe that other peoples decisions are wrong, even immoral. But under our constitution, if you show up tomorrow and obey the law, and you work hard and you do what youre supposed to do, you are entitled to equal treatment. Thats the way the system works. All over the world, people are being torn apart  Bosnia, the Middle East, Northern Ireland, Rwanda, Burundi  you name it  because of all their differences. We still have some of that hatred inside us. You see it in the church burnings.

Weve made that clear. And I would just say that it seems to me that thats the way it ought to be. We shouldnt discriminate  race, color, whatever  life-style, disability. This is America. And were all proud of it. But were not there yet. What we need is good, strong leadership going in the next century. Im sorry we didnt have a foreign policy question, because just this week Secretary Christopher said, Well, we really didnt know much the first couple of years about foreign policy. Now that was quite an admission. It underscores what I had to say in the Hartford debate, that there is really no foreign policy in this administration.

Its not about President Clinton. Its about the process. Its about selecting a president of the United States. So we have our differences. We should have our differences. Mentioned other parties. They have their differences. We all agreed it would be a pretty dull place. We should have more debates. Maybe we will have another debate on the economy. But I would just say this. This is the highest honor that I have ever had in my life, to think that somebody from Russell, Kansas, somebody who grew up living in a basement apartment, someone whose parents didnt finish high school, somebody who spent about 39 months in hospitals after World War II, someone who uses a buttonhook every day to get dressed. Somebody who understands that therere real Americans out there with real problems, whether soccer moms, or the single parents, the families or the seniors, or people with disabilities, whoever it may be. There are some very fundamental differences in this campaign. President Clinton opposes term limits, President Clinton opposes a constitutional amendment to balance the budget. President Clinton opposes voluntary prayer amendment. Opposes an amendment to protect the flag of the United States of America. People give their lives. Couple of service men here. They sacrifice, they give everything for America. We ought to protect the American flag with a constitutional amendment. But beyond that we need to address the economy. I will just say my time is running out here. Its a very proud moment for me. What I want the voters to do is to make a decision. And I want them to be proud of their vote in the years ahead. Proud that they voted for the right candidate. Proud that they voted hopefully for me. And Ill just make you one promise, my word is good. Democrats and Republicans said Bob Doles word is good.

Its a remarkable thing in a country like ours, a man who grew up in Russell, Kansas, and one who was born to a widowed mother in Hope, Arkansas, could wind up running for president. Could have a chance to serve as president. First thing I want to say is thank you for giving me the chance to be president. This election is about two different visions about how we should go into the 21st Century. Would we be better off as I believe, working together to give each other the tools we need to make the most of our God-given potential, or are we better off saying, youre on your own? Would we be better off building that bridge to the future together so we can all walk across it or saying you can get across yourself? If you dont agree  leave this room with anything else tonight and if the people watching us dont leave with anything else, I hope you will leave with this. This is a real important election. The world is changing dramatically in how we work and how we live, how we relate to each other, huge changes. And the decisions we make will have enormous practical consequences. So weve talked about our responsibility tonight. I want to talk about your responsibility, and your responsibility. Your responsibility is to show up on November the 5th. Because youre going to decide whether were going to balance the budget now, but protect Medicare, Medicaid, education and the environment. You will decide whether were going to keep fighting crime with a Brady Bill, assault weapons and finish putting those 100,000 police. Whether were going to move a million people from welfare to work. Whether were going to give our families more protection for their kids against drugs and tobacco and gangs and guns. Whether were going to give our children a world-class education. Where every eight-year-old can read. Every 12-year-old can log in on the Internet. Every 18-year-old can go to college.

Governor Bill Clinton, the Democratic nominee, President George Bush, the Republican nominee, and independent candidate Ross Perot. I am Jim Lehrer of the MacNeil-Lehrer Newshour on PBS. I will be the moderator for this debate, which is being sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates. It will be 90 minutes long. It is happening before an audience on the campus of Michigan State University in East Lansing. The format was conceived by and agreed to by representatives of the Bush and Clinton campaigns, and it is somewhat different than those used in the earlier debates. I will ask questions for the first half under rules that permit follow-ups. A panel of 3 other journalists will ask questions in the 2nd half under rules that do not. As always, each candidate will have 2 minutes, up to 2 minutes, to make a closing statement. The order of those, as well as that for the formal questioning, were all determined by a drawing. Gentlemen, again welcome and again good evening.

Governor Clinton,"No. There are many people who believe that the only way we can get this country turned around is to tax the middle class more and punish them more, but the truth is that middle-class Americans are basically the only group of Americans whove been taxed more in the 1980s and during the last 12 years, even though their incomes have gone down. The wealthiest Americans have been taxed much less, even though their incomes have gone up. Middle-class people will have their fair share of changing to do, and many challenges to face, including the challenge of becoming constantly re-educated. But my plan is a departure from trickle-down economics, just cutting taxes on the wealthiest Americans and getting out of the way. Its also a departure from tax-and- spend economics, because you cant tax and divide an economy that isnt growing. I propose an American version of what works in other countries  I think we can do it better: invest and grow. I believe we can increase investment and reduce the deficit at the same time, if we not only ask the wealthiest Americans and foreign corporations to pay their share; we also provide over $100 billion in tax relief, in terms of incentives for new plants, new small businesses, new technologies, new housing, and for middle class families; and we have $140 billion of spending cuts. Invest and grow. Raise some more money, spend the money on tax incentives to have growth in the private sector, take the money from the defense cuts and reinvest it in new transportation and communications and environmental clean-up systems. This will work. On this, as on so many other issues, I have a fundamental difference from the present administration. I dont believe trickle down economics will work. Unemployment is up. Most people are working harder for less money than they were making 10 years ago. I think we can do better if we have the courage to change.",1992-10-19,Democrat

Bush,"Well, he doesnt like trickle down government but I think hes talking about the Reagan-Bush years where we created 15 million jobs. The rich are paying a bigger percent of the total tax burden. And what I dont like is trickle down government. And therein, I think Governor Clinton keeps talking about trickle down, trickle down, and hes still talking about spending more and taxing more. Government  he says invest government, grow government. Government doesnt create jobs. If they do, theyre make-work jobs. Its the private sector that creates jobs. And yes, weve got too many taxes on the American people and were spending too much. And thats why I want to get the deficit down by controlling the growth of mandatory spending. It wont be painless. I think Mr. Perot put his finger on something there. It wont be painless but weve got to get the job done. But not by raising taxes. Mr. and Mrs. America, when you hear him say were going to tax only the rich, watch your wallet because his figures dont add up and hes going to sock it right to the middle class taxpayer and lower, if hes going to pay for all the spending programs he proposes. So we have a big difference on this trickle down theory. I do not want any more trickle down government. Its gotten too big. I want to do something about that.",1992-10-19,Republican
Lehrer,"Mr. Perot, what do you think of the governors approach, what he just laid out?",1992-10-19,Moderator
Perot,"The basic problem with it, it doesnt balance the budget. If you forecast it out, we still have a significant deficit under each of their plans, as I understand them. Our challenge is to stop the financial bleeding. If you take a patient into the hospital thats bleeding arterially, step one is to stop the bleeding. And we are bleeding arterially. Theres only one way out of this, and that is to stop the deterioration of our job base, to have a growing, expanding job base, to give us the tax base  see, balancing the budget is not nearly as difficult as paying off the $4 trillion debt and leaving our children the American dream intact. We have spent their money. Weve got to pay it back. This is going to take fair, shared sacrifice. My plan balances the budget within 6 years. We didnt do it faster than that because we didnt want to disrupt the economy. We gave it off to a slow start and a fast finish to give the economy time to recover. But we faced it and we did it, and we believe its fair, shared sacrifice. The one thing I have done is lay it squarely on the table in front of the American people. Youve had a number of occasions to see in detail what the plan is, and at least youll understand it. I think thats fundamental in our country, that you know what youre getting into.",1992-10-19,Independent
Lehrer,"Governor, the word pain  one of the other leadership things thats put on you is that you dont speak of pain, that you speak of all things  nobodys going to really have to suffer under your plan. Youve heard what Mr. Perot has said. Hes said its got  to do the things that you want to do, you cant do it by just taking the money from the rich. Thats what the president says as well. How do you respond to that? They said the numbers dont add up.",1992-10-19,Moderator
Clinton,"I disagree with both of them. For one thing, let me just follow up here. I disagree with Mr. Perot that the answer is to raise  put a 50-cent gas tax on the middle class and raise more taxes on the middle class and the working poor than on the wealthy. His own analysis says that unemployment will be slightly higher in 1995 under his plan than it is today. And as far as what Mr. Bush says, he is the person who raised taxes on the middle class after saying he wouldnt. And just this year, Mr. Bush vetoed a tax increase on the wealthy that gave middle class tax relief. He vetoed middle class tax relief this year. And furthermore, under this administration, spending has increased more than it has in the last 20 years and he asked Congress to spend more money than it actually spent. Now, its hard to out-spend Congress but he tried to for the last 3 years. So my view is the middle class is the  theyve been suffering, Jim. Now, should people pay more for Medicare if they can? Yes. Should they pay more for Social Security if they get more out of it than they paid in, theyre upper income people? Yes. But look whats happened to the middle class. Middle class Americans are working harder for less money than they were making ten years ago and theyre paying higher taxes. The tax burden on them has not gone down. It has gone up. I dont think the answer is to slow the economy down more, drive unemployment up more and undermine the health of the private sector. The answer is to invest and grow this economy. Thats what works in other countries and thats whatll work here.",1992-10-19,Democrat

I think everyones paying too much, but I think this idea that you can go out and  then he hits me for vetoing a tax bill. Yes, I did. And the American taxpayer ought to be glad they have a president to stand up to a spending Congress. We remember what it was like when we had a spending president and a spending Congress, and interest rates  who remembers that? They were at 21.5% under Jimmy Carter, and inflation was 15. We dont want to go back to that. And so yes, everybodys taxed too much and I want to get the taxes down, but not by signing a tax bill thats gonna raise taxes on people.",1992-10-19,Republican

On pay for teachers, on all these categories, Arkansas is right near the very bottom. You havent heard me mention this before, but were getting close now and I think its about time I start putting things in perspective. And Im going to do that. Its not dirty campaigning because hes been talking about my record for a half a year here, 11 months here. So weve got to do that. I gotta get it in perspective. Whats his mistake?

One of the reasons is we almost had it done, and the speaker  a very, able, decent fellow, I might add  but he twisted the arms of some of the sponsors of that legislation and had them change their vote. Whats relevant here is that tool, that discipline, that he has to live by in Arkansas, and Id like it for the American people. I want the line-item veto. I want a check-off, so if the Congress cant do it, let people check off their income tax, 10% of it, to compel the government to cut spending.

And now we hear a lot of talk, oh, well, we all want enterprise zones, and yet the House and the Senate cant send it down without loading it up with a lot of, you know, these Christmas tree ornaments they put on the legislation. I dont think in racial harmony that Im a laggard on that. Ive been speaking out since day 1. Weve gotten the Americans for Disabilities Act, which I think is one of the foremost pieces of civil rights legislation. And yes, it took me to veto 2 civil rights quota bills because I dont believe in quotas, and I dont think the American people believe in quotas.

I think its important to elect a president who is committed to getting this economy going again, and who realizes we have to abandon trickle-down economics and put the American people first again, and who will send programs to the Congress in the first hundred days to deal with the critical issues that America is crying out for leadership on  jobs, incomes, the health care crisis, the need to control the economy.

But if youre talking about protecting the taxpayer against his friends in the US Congress, go back to what it was like when you had a Democratic president and a Democratic Congress. You dont have to go back to Herbert Hoover. Go back to Jimmy Carter, and interest rates were 21%, inflation was 15%. The misery index  unemployment and inflation added together  it was invented by the Democrats  went right through the roof. Weve cut it in half. And all you hear about is how bad things are. You know, remember the question, are you better off? Well, is a homebuyer better off he can refinance the home, because interest rates are down? Is the senior citizen better off because inflation is not wiping out their familys savings? I think they are. Is the guy out of work better off? Of course hes not, but hes not gonna be better off if we grow the government, if we invest, as Governor Clinton says, invest in more government. Youve got to free up the private sector. Youve got to let small businesses have more incentives. For 3 months  quarters Ive been fighting, 3 quarters been fighting to get the Congress to pass some incentives for small business. Capital gains, investment tax allowance, credit for first- time homebuyers. And its blocked by the Congress.

Lehrer,"I have to  we have to talk about Ross Perot now or hell get me, Im sure. Mr. Perot, on this issue that I have raised at the very beginning and weve been talking about, which is leadership, as president of the US, it concerns  my reading of it, at least, my concerns about you, as expressed by folks in the polls and other places, it goes like this. You had a problem with General Motors. You took your $750 million and you left. You had a problem in the spring and summer about some personal hits that you took as a potential candidate for president of the US and you walked out.",1992-10-19,Moderator
Perot,"I think the General Motors thing is very relevant. I did everything I could to get General Motors to face its problems in the mid-80s while it was still financially strong. They just wouldnt do it, and everybody now knows the terrible price theyre paying by waiting until its obvious to the brain-dead that they have problems. Now, hundreds, thousands of good, decent people, whole cities up here in this state are adversely impacted because they would not move in a timely way. Our government is that point now. The thing that I am in this race for is to tap the American people on the shoulder and to say to every single one of you, fix it while were still relatively strong. If you have a heart problem, you dont wait till a heart attack to address it. So the General Motors experience is relevant. At the point when I could not get them to address those problems, I had created so much stress in the board, who wanted to just keep the Lawrence Welk music going, that they asked to buy my remaining shares. I sold them my remaining shares. They went their way. I went my way because it was obvious we had a complete disagreement about what should be done with the company. But lets take my life in perspective. Again and again, on complex, difficult tasks, I have stayed the course. When I was asked by our government to do the POW project, within a year the Vietnamese had sent people into Canada to make arrangements to have me and my family killed. And I had 5 small children, and my family and I decided we would stay the course, and we lived with that problem for 3 years. Then I got into the Texas War on Drugs program and the big-time drug dealers got all upset. Then when I had 2 people imprisoned in Iran, I could have left them there. I could have rationalized it. We went over, we got them out, we brought them back home. And since then, for years, I have lived with the burden of the Middle East, where its eye for an eye and tooth for a tooth country, in terms of their unhappiness with the fact that I was successful in that effort. Again and again and again, in the middle of the night, at 2 or 3 oclock in the morning, my government has called me to take extraordinary steps for Americans in distress, and again and again and again I have responded. And I didnt wilt and I didnt quit. Now, what happened in July weve covered again and again and again. But I think in terms of the American peoples concern about my commitment, Im here tonight, folks; I never quit supporting you as you put me on the ballot in the other 26 states; and when you asked me to come back in, I came back in. And talk about not quitting, Im spending my money on this campaign; the 2 parties are spending your money, taxpayer money. I put my wallet on the table for you and your children. Over $60 million at least will go into this campaign to leave the American dream to you and your children, to get this country straightened out, because if anybody owes it to you, I do. Ive lived the American dream; Id like for your children to be able to live it, too.",1992-10-19,Independent

Clinton,"I dont have any criticism of Mr. Perot. I think what Id like to talk about a minute, since youre asking the question, is the General Motors issue. I dont think theres any question that the automobile executives made some errors in the 1980s, but I also think we should look at how much productivity has increased lately, how much labor has done to increase productivity and how much management has done. And were still losing a lot of auto jobs, in my judgment, because we dont have a national economic strategy that will build the industrial base of this country. Just today I met with the presidents and the vice presidents of the Willow Run union here, near here. They both said they were Vietnam veterans supporting me because I had an economic program to put them back to work. We need an investment incentive to modernize plant and equipment; weve got to control the health care costs for those people  otherwise we cant keep the manufacturing jobs here; and we need a tough trade policy that is fair, that insists on open markets in return for open markets. We ought to have a strategy that will build the economic and industrial base. So I think Mr. Perot was right in questioning the management practices. But they didnt have much of a partner in government here as compared with the policies the Germans and the Japanese followed, and I believe we can do better. Thats one of the things I want to change. I know that we can grow manufacturing jobs. We did it in my state, and we can do it nationally.",1992-10-19,Democrat

Bush,"Well, I wondered, when Governor Clinton was talking to the auto workers, whether he talked about his and Senator Gores favoring CAFE standards, fuel efficiency standards, of 40 miles per gallon. That would break the auto industry and throw a lot of people out of work. As regarding Mr. Perot, I take back something I said about him. I once said, in a frivolous moment, when he got out of the race: If you cant stand the heat, buy an air conditioning company. And I take it back, because I think  he said he made a mistake. And the thing I find is if I make a mistake, I admit it. Ive never heard Governor Clinton make a mistake. But one mistake hes made is fuel efficiency standards at 40 to 45 miles a gallon will throw many auto workers out of work, and you cant have it both ways. Theres a pattern here of appealing to the auto workers and then trying to appeal to the spotted owl crowds or the extremes in the environmental movement. You cant do it as president: you cant have a pattern of one side of the issue one day and another the next. So my argument is not with Ross Perot; it is more with Governor Clinton.",1992-10-19,Republican
Lehrer,"Governor, what about that charge? Do you want it both ways on this issue?",1992-10-19,Moderator
Clinton,"Lets just talk about the CAFE standards  thats the fuel efficiency standards. They are now 27.5 miles per gallon per automobile fleet. I never said  and I defy you to find where I said  I gave an extensive environmental speech in April, and I said that we ought to have a goal of raising the fuel efficiency standards to 40 miles a gallon. I think that should be a goal. I have never said we should write it into law if there is evidence that that goal cannot be achieved. The Natl Science Foundation did a study which said it would be difficult for us to reach fuel efficiency standards in excess of 37 miles per gallon by the year 2000. I think we should try to raise the fuel efficiency. And let me say this. I think we ought to have incentives to do it, I think we ought to push to do it. That doesnt mean we have to write it into the law. Look, I am a job creator, not a job destroyer. It is the Bush administration that has had no new jobs in the private sector in the last 4 years. In my state, were leading the country in private sector job growth. But it is good for America to improve fuel efficiency. We also ought to convert more vehicles to compressed natural gas. Thats another way to improve the environment.",1992-10-19,Democrat

Perot,"Well, everybodys nibbling around the edges. Lets go to the center of the bulls-eye, the core problem. And believe me, everybody on the factory floor all over this country knows it. You implement that NAFTA, the Mexican trade agreement, where they pay people a dollar an hour, have no health care, no retirement, no pollution controls, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, and youre going to hear a giant sucking sound of jobs being pulled out of this country right at a time when we need the tax base to pay the debt and pay down the interest on the debt and get our house back in order. Weve got to proceed very carefully on that. See, theres a lot I dont understand. I do understand business. I do understand creating jobs. I do understand how to make things work. And I got a long history of doing that. Now, if you want to go to the core problem that faces everybody in manufacturing in this country, its that agreement thats about to be put into practice. Its very simple. Everybody says itll create jobs. Yes, itll create bubble jobs. Now, you know, watch this  listen very carefully to this. One-time surge while we build factories and ship machine tools and equipment down there. Then year after year for decades, they will have jobs. And I finally  I thought I didnt understand it  called all the experts, and they said, oh, itll be disruptive for 12 to 15 years. Lets think it through here. Lets be careful. Im for free trade philosophically, but I have studied these trade agreements till the world has gone flat, and we dont have good trade agreements across the world. I hope well have a chance to get into that tonight, because I can get right to the center of the bulls-eye and tell you why were losing whole industries in this country.",1992-10-19,Independent

My problem with Governor Clinton, once again, is that one time hes gonna make up his mind, he sees some merit in it, but then he sees a lot of things wrong with it. Then the other day he says hes for it, however then weve got to pass other legislation. When youre president of the US, you cannot have this pattern of saying well, Im for it but Im on the other side of it. And its true on this and its true on CAFE. Look, if Ross were right when we get a free trade agreement with Mexico, why wouldnt they have gone down there now? You have a differential in wages right now. I just have an honest philosophical difference. I think free trade is going to expand our job opportunity. I think it is exports that have saved us when were in a global slowdown, a connected global slowdown, a recession in some countries. And its free trade, fair trade that needs to be our hallmark, and we need more free trade agreements, not fewer.",1992-10-19,Republican

Neither I nor anybody else, as far a I know, agreed to give him our proxy to say that whatever he did was fine for the workers of this country and for the interests of this country. I am the one whos in the middle on this. Mr. Perot says its a bad deal. Mr. Bush says its a hunky-dory deal. I say on balance it does more good than harm if, if we can get some protection for the environment so that the Mexicans have to follow their own environmental standards, their own labor law standards, and if we have a genuine commitment to reeducate and retrain the American workers who lose their jobs and reinvest in this economy. I have a realistic approach to trade. I want more trade, and I know there are some good things in that agreement. But it can sure be made better. Let me just point out, just today in the Los Angeles Times Clyde Prestowitz, who was one of President Reagans leading trade advisers and a life-long conservative Republican, endorsed my candidacy because he knows that Ill have a free and fair trade policy, a hard-headed, realistic policy, and not get caught up in rubber-stamping everything the Bush administration did.

Clinton,"If I had it to do over again I might answer the questions a little better. You know, Id been in public life a long time and no one had ever questioned my role and so I was asked a lot of questions about things that happened a long time ago and I dont think I answered them as well as I could have. Going back 23 years, I dont know, Helen. I was opposed to the war. I couldnt help that. I felt very strongly about it, and I didnt want to go at the time. Its easy to say in retrospect I would have done something differently. President Lincoln opposed the war and there were people who said maybe he shouldnt be president, but I think he made us a pretty good president in wartime. Weve had a lot of other presidents who didnt wear their countrys uniform who had to order our young soldiers into battle, including President Wilson and President Roosevelt. So the answer is I could do that. I wouldnt relish doing it but I wouldnt shrink from it. I think that the president has to be prepared to use the power of the nation when our vital interests are threatened, when our treaty commitments are at stake, when we know that something has to be done that is in the national interest, and that is a part of being president. Could I do it? Yes, I could.",1992-10-19,Democrat

On April 17 he said hed bring out all the records on the draft. They have not been forthcoming. He got a deferment or he didnt. He got a notice or he didnt. And I think its this pattern that troubles me, more than the draft. A lot of decent, honorable people felt as he did on the draft. But its this pattern. And again, you might be able to make amendments all the time, Governor, but youve got to, as president, you cant be on all these different sides, and you cant have this pattern of saying well, I did this or I didnt, then the facts come out and you change it.

GENE GIBBONS (Reuters): Mr. President, you keep saying that you made a mistake in agreeing to a tax increase to get the 1990 budget deal with Congress. But if you hadnt gotten that deal, you would have either had to get repeal of the Gramm-Rudman Deficit Control Act or cut defense spending drastically at a time when the country was building up for the gulf war, and decimate domestic discretionary spending, including such things as air traffic control.",1992-10-19,Moderator
Bush,"I wouldnt have taken any of the alternatives. I believe that  I believe I made a mistake. I did it for the very reasons you say. There was one good thing that came out of that budget agreement, and that is we put a cap on discretionary spending. One-third of the presidents budget is at the presidents discretion, or really the Congress, since they appropriate every dime and tell a president how to spend every dime. Weve put a cap on the growth of all that spending, and thats good and thats helped. But I was wrong because I thought the tax compromise, going along with 1 Democratic tax increase, would help the economy. I see no evidence that it has done it. So what would I have done? What should I have done? I should have held out for a better deal that would have protected the taxpayer and not ended up doing what we had to do, or what I thought at the time would help. So I made a mistake, and I  you know, the difference, I think, is that I knew at the time I was going to take a lot of political flak. I knew wed have somebody out there yelling read my lips, and I did it because I thought it was right. And I made a mistake. Thats quite different than taking a position where you know its best for you. That wasnt best for me and I knew it in the very beginning. I thought it would be better for the country than it was.

Nobody ever told the American people that we increased spending $1.83 for every dollar of taxes raised. Thats absolutely unconscionable. Both parties carry a huge blame for that on their shoulders. This was not a way to pay down the deficit. This was a trick on the American people. Thats not leadership. Lets go back in terms of accepting responsibility for your actions. If you create Saddam Hussein, over a 10-year period, using billions of dollars of US taxpayer money, step up to the plate and say it was a mistake. If you create Noriega, using taxpayer money, step up to the plate and say it was a mistake. If you cant get your act together to pick him up one day when a Panamanian major has kidnapped him and a special forces team is 400 yards away and its a stroll across the park to get him, and if you cant get your act together, at least pick up the Panamanian major, who they then killed, step up to the plate and admit it was a mistake.

The choices were not good then. I think at the time, the mistake that was made was signing off on the deal late on Saturday night in the middle of the night. Thats just what the president did when he vetoed the Family Leave Act. I think what he should have done is gone before the American people on the front end and said listen, I made a commitment and it was wrong. I made a mistake because I couldnt have foreseen these circumstances and this is the best deal we can work out at the time. He said it was in the public interest at the time and most everybody who was involved in it, I guess, thought it was. The real mistake was the read my lips promise in the first place.

In order to lead, you first have to use the White House as a bully pulpit and lead; then you have to develop consensus or you cant get anything done, and thats where we are now.

And the average citizen out here is just working hard every day. Youve got to go to the people. I just love the fact that everybody, particularly in the media, goes bonkers over the town hall. I guess its because you will lose your right to tell them what to think. The point is, theyll get to decide what to think. I love the fact that people will listen to a guy with a bad accent and a poor presentation manner talking about flip charts for 30 minutes, because they want the details. See, all the folks up there at the top said the attention span of the American people is no more than 5 minutes, they wont watch it. Theyre thirsty for it. You want to have a new program in this country. If you get grassroots America excited about it, and if they tap Congress on the shoulder and say do it, Charlie, itll happen. And thats a whole lot different from these fellows running up and down the halls whispering in their ears now and promising campaign funds for the next election if they do it.

And in 12 years as governor I guess Ive taken on every interest group there was in my state at one time or another to fight for change. It can be done.

Yes, we tried, and, yes, we failed to bring him into the family of nations; he had the 4th largest army. But then when he moved against Kuwait, I said this will not stand. And its hard to build a consensus. We went to the UN, we made historic resolutions up there, the whole world was united, our Congress was dragging its feet. Governor Clinton said, well, I might have been with the minority, let sanctions work  but I guess I would have voted with the majority. A president cant do that. Sometimes he has to act. And in this case Im glad we did, because if we had let sanctions work and tried to build a consensus on that, Saddam Hussein today would be in Saudi Arabia controlling the worlds oil supply, and he would be there maybe with a nuclear weapon.

The Natl Womens Political Caucus gave me an award, one of their Good Guy Awards, for my involvement of women in high levels of government, and Ive appointed more minorities to positions of high level in government than all the governors in the history of my state combined, before me.

Are those accusations correct  investigating your staff, investigating the leaders of the grassroots movement, investigating associates of your family?",1992-10-19,Moderator
Perot,"No. Theyre not correct and if you look at my life, until I got involved in this effort, I was one person. And then after the Republican dirty tricks group got through with me Im another person, which I consider an absolutely sick operation. And all of you in the press know exactly what Im talking about. They investigated every single one of my children. They investigated my wife. They interviewed all of my childrens friends from childhood on. They went to extraordinary sick lengths, and I just found it amusing that they would take 2 or 3 cases where I was involved in lawsuits and would engage an investigator  the lawyers would engage an investigator, which is common. And the only difference between me and any other businessman that has the range of businesses that I have is I havent had that many lawsuits. So thats just another one of those little fruit-loopy things they make up to try to, instead of facing issues, to try to redefine a person thats running against them. This goes on night and day. I will do everything I can, if I get up there, to make dirty tricks a thing of the past. One of the 2 groups has raised it to an art form. Its a sick art form. Now, lets go back to Saddam Hussein. We gave Ambassador Glaspie written instructions. Thats a fact. Weve never let the Congress and the Foreign Relations, Senate Intelligence Committees see them. Thats a fact. Ambassador Glaspie did a lot of talking right after July 25 and thats a fact and its in all the newspapers. And you pull all of it at once and read it and I did, and its pretty clear what she and Kelly and the other key guys around that thing thought they were doing. Then at the end of the war, when they had to go testify about it, their stories are a total disconnect from what they said in August, September and October. So I say this is very simple. Saddam Hussein released a tape, as you know, claiming it was a transcript of their meeting, where she said we will not become involved in your border dispute and, in effect, you can take the northern part of the country. We later said no, thats not true. I said well, this is simple. What were her written instructions? We guard those like the secrets of the atomic bomb, literally. Now, I say whose country is this? This is ours. Who will get hurt if we lay those papers on the table? The worst thing is, again, its a mistake. Nobody did any of this with evil intent. I just object to the fact that we cover up and hide things. Whether its Iran-contra, Iraq-gate or you name it, its a steady stream.",1992-10-19,Independent

And lets give him the credit he deserves for organizing Operation Desert Storm and Desert Shield. It was a remarkable event. But lets look at where I think the real mistake was made. In 1988 when the war between Iraq and Iran ended, we knew Saddam Hussein was a tyrant, we had dealt with him because he was against Iran  the enemy of my enemy maybe is my friend. All right, the wars over; we know hes dropping mustard gas on his own people, we know hes threatened to incinerate half of Israel. Several government departments  several  had information that he was converting our aid to military purposes and trying to develop weapons of mass destruction. But in late 89 the president signed a secret policy saying we were going to continue to try to improve relations with him, and we sent him some sort of communication on the eve of his invasion of Kuwait that we still wanted better relations. So I think what was wrong  I give credit where credit is due  but the responsibility was in coddling Saddam Hussein when there was no reason to do it and when people at high levels in our government knew he was trying to do things that were outrageous.",1992-10-19,Democrat

All our Arab allies out there thought we ought to do just exactly that. And when he crossed the line, I stood up and looked into the camera and I said: This aggression will not stand. And we formed a historic coalition, and we brought him down, and we destroyed the 4th largest army. And the battlefield was searched, and there wasnt one single iota of evidence that any US weapons were on that battlefield. And the nuclear capability has been searched by the United Nations, and there hasnt been one single scintilla of evidence that theres any US technology involved in it. And what youre seeing on all this Iraq-gate is a bunch of people who were wrong on the war trying to cover their necks here and try to do a little revisionism. And I cannot let that stand, because it isnt true. Yes, we had grain credits for Iraq, and there isnt any evidence that those grain credits were diverted into weaponry  none, none whatsoever. And so I just have to say, its fine.

Now there are rumblings that a commercial bank crisis is on the horizon.",1992-10-19,Moderator
Clinton,"Gene, there is a problem in the sense that there are some problem banks, and on December 19th new regulations will go into effect which will in effect give the government the responsibility to close some banks that are not technically insolvent but that are plainly in trouble. On the other hand, I dont think that we have any reason to believe that the dimensions of this crisis are anywhere near as great as the savings and loan crisis. The mistake that both parties made in Washington with the S&L business was deregulating them without proper capital requirements, proper oversight and regulation, proper training of the executives. Many people predicted what happened, and it was a disaster. The banking system in this country is fundamentally sound with some weak banks. I think that our goal ought to be first of all not to politicize it, not to frighten people; secondly to say that we have to enforce the law in 2 ways. We dont want to overreact, as the federal regulators have in my judgment, on good banks so that theyve created credit crunches, that is, they have made our recession worse in the last couple of years  but we do want to act prudently with the banks that are in trouble. We also want to say that insofar as is humanly possible the banking industry itself should pay for the cost of any bank failures; the taxpayers should not. And that will be my policy. And I believe if we have a good balanced approach, we can get the good banks loaning money again, end the credit crunch, have proper regulation on the ones that are in trouble, and not overreact. It is a serious problem, but I dont see it as the kind of terrible, terrible problem that the S&L problem was.",1992-10-19,Democrat

And when I am re-elected, I believe one of the first things ought to be to press a new Congress not beholden to the old ways to pass financial reform legislation that modernizes the banking system, doesnt put a lot of inhibitions on it, and protects the depositors through keeping the FDIC sound. But I think that  I just was watching some of the proceedings of the American Bankers Assn, and I think the general feeling is most of the banks are sound, certainly theres no comparison here between what happened to the S&Ls and where the banks stand right now, in my view.",1992-10-19,Republican

These crooks  now, Willie Sutton would have gone to own a savings and loan rather than rob banks, because he robbed banks because thats where the money is; owning a savings and loan is where the money was. Now, in 1984 they were told. I believe the vice president was in charge of deregulation. Nobody touched that tar baby till the day after election in 1988 because they were flooding both parties with crooked PAC money, and it was in many cases stolen PAC money. Now, you and I never got a ride on a lot of these yachts and fancy things it bought, but you and I are paying for it. And they buried it till right after the election. Now, if you believe The Washington Post and you believe this extensive study thats been done  and Im reading it  right after election day this year theyre going to hit us with a hundred banks, it will be a $100-billion problem.

All these specific examples Im giving tonight  if you had a business like that, theyd be leading you away and boarding up the doors. We have a government that doesnt work. Its supposed to come from the people, it comes at the people. The people need to take their government back.

And Ive covered it again and again in print and on television. But very specifically the key thing is to turn the government back to the people and take it away from the special interests and have people go to Washington to serve. Who can give themselves a 23% pay raise anywhere in the world except Congress? Who would have 1200 airplanes worth 2 billion a year just to fly around in?

Im going to be running an ad pretty soon that shows they promised us they were going to hold the line on spending at the tax and budget summit, and Im going to show how much theyve increased this little stuff they do for themselves. And it is silly putty, folks, and the American people have had enough of it. Step one, if I get up there, were going to clean that up. You say, how can I get Congress to do that? Ill have millions of people at my shoulder, shoulder to shoulder with me, and we will see it done work speed  because its wrong. Weve turned the country upside down.",1992-10-19,Independent
Lehrer,"Governor Clinton, you have one minute. Governor?",1992-10-19,Moderator
Clinton,"I would just point out, on the point Mr. Perot made, I agree that we need to cut spending in Congress. Ive called for a 25% reduction in congressional staffs and expenditures. But the White House staff increased its expenditures by considerably more than Congress has in the last 4 years under the Bush administration, and Congress has actually spent a billion dollars less than President Bush asked them to spend. Now, when you out-spend Congress youre really swinging. That, however, is not my only passion. The real problem in this country is that most people are working hard and falling farther behind. My passion is to pass a jobs program and get incomes up with an investment incentive program to grow jobs in the private sector, to waste less public money and invest more, to control health care costs and provide for affordable health care for all Americans and to make sure weve got the best trained workforce in the world. That is my passion. Weve gotta get this country growing again and this economy strong again or we cant bring down the deficit. Economic growth is the key to the future of this country.",1992-10-19,Democrat

Bush,Government reform?,1992-10-19,Republican
Lehrer,"Yes, exactly. Well, to respond to the subject that Mr. Perot mentioned.",1992-10-19,Moderator
Bush,"Well, how about this for a government reform policy? Reduce the White House staff by a 3rd after or at the same time the Congress does the same thing for their staff. Term limits for members of the US Congress. Give the government back to the people. Lets do it that way. The president has term limits. Lets limit some of these guys sitting out here tonight. Term limits. And then how about a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution? Forty-3  more than that  states have it, I believe. Lets try that. And you want to do something about all this extra spending that concerns Mr. Perot and me? Okay. How about a line item veto? Forty-three governors have that. And give it to the president, and if the Congress isnt big enough to do it, let the president have a shot at this excess spending. A line item veto. That means you can take a line and cut out some of the pork out of a meaningful bill. Governor Clinton keeps hitting me on vetoing legislation. Well, thats the only protection the taxpayer has against some of these reckless pork programs up there, and Id rather be able to just line it right out of there and get on about passing some good stuff but leave out the garbage. Line item veto  theres a good reform program for you.",1992-10-19,Republican

Rook,"Governor Clinton, you said that you will raise taxes on the rich, people with incomes of $200,000 a year or higher. A lot of people are saying that you will have to go lower than that, much lower. Will you make a pledge tonight below which, an income level that you will not go below? Im looking for numbers, sir, not just a concept.",1992-10-19,Moderator
Clinton,"My plan  you can read my plan. My plan says that we want to raise marginal incomes on family incomes above $200,000 from 31 to 36 percent, that we want to ask foreign corporations simply to pay the same percentage of taxes on their income that American corporations play (sic) in America, that we want to use that money to provide over $100 billion in tax cuts for investment in new plant and equipment, for small business, for new technologies, and for middle class tax relief. Now, Ill tell ya this. I will not raise taxes on the middle class to pay for these programs. If the money does not come in there to pay for these programs, we will cut other government spending or we will slow down the phase-in of the programs. I am not gonna raise taxes on the middle class to pay for these programs. Now furthermore, I am not gonna tell you read my lips on anything because I cannot foresee what emergencies might develop in this country. And the president said never, never, never would he raise taxes in New Jersey, and within a day Marlin Fitzwater, his spokesman, said now, thats not a promise. So I think even he has learned that you cant say read my lips because you cant know what emergencies might come up. But I can tell you this. Im not gonna raise taxes on middle class Americans to pay for the programs Ive recommended. Read my plan. And you know how you can trust me about that? Because you know, in the first debate, Mr. Bush made some news. Hed just said Jim Baker was going to be secretary of state and in the first debate he said no, now hes gonna be responsible for domestic economic policy. Well, Ill tell ya. Ill make some news in the 3rd debate. The person responsible for domestic economic policy in my administration will be Bill Clinton. Im gonna make those decisions, and I wont raise taxes on the middle class to pay for my programs.",1992-10-19,Democrat

Bush,"Thats what worries me that hes going to be responsible. Hes going to do  and he would do for the US what hes done to Arkansas. He would do for the US what hes done to Arkansas. We do not want to be the lowest of the low. We are not a nation in decline. We are a rising nation. Now, my problem is  I heard what he said. He said I want to take it from the rich, raise $150 billion from the rich. To get it, to get $150 billion in new taxes, you got to go down to the guy thats making $36,600. And if you want to pay for the rest of his plan, all the other spending programs, youre going to sock it to the working man. So when you hear tax the rich, Mr. and Mrs. America, watch your wallet. Lock your wallet because hes coming right after you just like Jimmy Carter did and just like youre going to get  youre going to end up with interest rates at 21%, and youre going to have inflation going through the roof.

We rank first in the country in job growth, we got the lowest spending, state and local, in the country, and the 2nd lowest tax burden. And the difference between Arkansas and the US is that were going in the right direction and this countrys going in the wrong direction. And I have to defend the honor of my state.",1992-10-19,Democrat

You stay around this long enough, you think about  if you talk about it in Washington, you think you did it. If youve been on television about it, you think you did it. What we need is people to stop talking and start doing. Now, our real problem here is they both have plans that will not work. The Wall Street Journal said your numbers dont add up. And you can take it out on charts, you look at all the studies the different groups have done, you go out 4, 5, 6 years, were still drifting along with a huge deficit. So lets come back to harsh reality, and what I  you know, everybody says, gee, Perot, youre tough. Im saying, well, this is not as tough as World War II and its not as tough as the revolution. And its fair, shared sacrifice to do the right thing for our country and for our children. And it will be fun if we all work together to do it.",1992-10-19,Independent

Thomas,"Mr. President, why have you dropped so dramatically in the leadership polls, from the high 80s to the 40s? And you have said that you will do anything you have to do to get reelected. What can you do in 2 weeks to win reelection?",1992-10-19,Moderator
Bush,"Well, I think the answer to why the drop, I think, has been the economy in the doldrums. Why Ill win is I think I have the best plan of the 3 of us up here to do something about it. Mine does not grow the government, it does not invest, have government invest. It says we need to do better in terms of stimulating private business. We got a big philosophical difference here tonight between one who thinks the government can do all these things through tax and spend, and one who thinks it ought to go the other way. And so I believe the answer is, Im going to win it because Im getting into focus my agenda for Americas renewal, and also I think that Governor Clintons had pretty much of a free ride. On looking specifically at the Arkansas record  he keeps criticizing us, criticizing me, Im the incumbent, fine. But hes an incumbent, and weve got to look at all the facts. Theyre almost at the bottom on every single category. We cant do that to the American people. And then, Helen, I really believe where people are going to ask this question about trust, because I do think theres a pattern by Governor Clinton of saying one thing to please one group, and then trying to please another group. And I think that pattern is a dangerous thing to suggest would work for the Oval Office. It doesnt work that way when youre president. Truman is right. The buck stops there. And you have to make decisions even when its against your own interest. And Ive done that. Its against my political interest to say go ahead and go along with the tax increase, but I did what I thought was right at the time. So I think people are going to be looking for trust and experience. And then, I mentioned it the other night, I think if theres a crisis, people are going to say, well, George Bush has taken us through some tough crises, and we trust him to do that. And so Ill make the appeal on a wide array of issues. Also I got a philosophical difference. I got to watch the clock here. I dont think were a declining nation. The whole world has had economic problems. Were doing better than a lot of the countries in the world. And were going to lead the way out of this economic recession across this world and economic slowdown here at home.",1992-10-19,Republican

Im totally focussed on the fact that we still could have enterprise zones, according to both parties, but we dont. So I am still focussed on gridlock, I guess. And I am also focussed on the fact that isnt it a paradox that we have the highest productivity in our workforce in the industrialized world and at the same time have the largest trade deficit, and at the same time rank behind 9 other nations in what we pay our most productive people in the world, and were losing whole industries overseas. Now, cant somebody agree with me that the government is breaking businesss legs with these trade agreements? Theyre breaking businesss legs in a number of different ways. We have an adversarial relationship thats destroying jobs and sending them overseas while we have the finest workers in the world. Keep in mind a factory worker has nothing to do with anything except putting it together on the factory floor. Its our obligation to make sure that we give him the finest products in the world to put together and we dont break his legs in the process.",1992-10-19,Independent

But the main thing is he still didnt get it, from what he said the other night to that fine woman on our program, the 209 people in Richmond. They dont want us talking about each other. They want us to talk about the problems of this country. I dont think hell be reelected because trickle down economics is a failure and hes offering more of it, and what hes saying about my program is just not true. Look at the Republicans that have endorsed me. High tech executives in Northern California. Look at the 24 generals and admirals, retired, that have endorsed me, including the deputy commander of Desert Storm. Look at Sarah Brady, Jim Bradys wife, President Reagans press secretary, who endorsed me because he knuckled under to the NRA and wouldnt fight for the Brady Bill. Weve got a broad-based coalition that goes beyond party because I am going to change this country and make it better, with the help of the American people.",1992-10-19,Democrat
Lehrer,"All right. Now, that was the final question and answer and we now go to the closing statements. Each candidate will have up to 2 minutes. The order was determined by a drawing. Governor Clinton, youre first. Governor.",1992-10-19,Moderator
Clinton,"First, Id like to thank the commission and my opponents for participating in these debates and making them possible. I think the real winners of the debates were the American people. I was especially moved in Richmond a few days ago when 209 of our fellow citizens got to ask us questions. They went a long way toward reclaiming this election for the American people and taking their country back. I want to say, since this is the last time Ill be on a platform with my opponents, that even though I disagree with Mr. Perot on how fast we can reduce the deficit and how much we can increase taxes on the middle class, I really respect what hes done in this campaign to bring the issue of deficit reduction to our attention. Id like to say to Mr. Bush, even though Ive got profound differences with him, I do honor his service to our country. I appreciate his efforts and I wish him well. I just believe its time to change. I offer a new approach. Its not trickle down economics. Its been tried for 12 years and its failed. More people are working harder for less, 100,000 people a month losing their health insurance, unemployment going up, our economy slowing down. We can do better. And its not tax and spend economics. Its invest and grow, put our people first, control health care costs and provide basic health care to all Americans, have an education system 2nd to none and revitalize the private economy. That is my commitment to you. It is the kind of change that can open up a whole new world of opportunities to America as we enter the last decade of this century and move towards the 21st century. I want a country where people who work hard and play by the rules are rewarded, not punished. I want a country where people are coming together across the lines of race and region and income. I know we can do better. It wont take miracles and it wont happen overnight, but we can do much, much better if we have the courage to change. Thank you very much.",1992-10-19,Democrat
Lehrer,"President Bush, your closing statement, sir.",1992-10-19,Moderator
Bush,"Three weeks from now  2 weeks from tomorrow, America goes to the polls and youre going to have to decide who you want to lead this country to economic recovery. On jobs  thats the number one priority, and I believe my program for stimulating investment, encouraging small business, brand-new approach to education, strengthening the American family, and, yes, creating more exports is the way to go. I dont believe in trickle-down government, I dont believe in larger taxes and larger government spending. And, lastly, the other night on character Governor Clinton said its not the character of the president but the character of the presidency. I couldnt disagree more. Horace Greeley said the only thing that endures is character. And I think it was Justice Black who talked about great nations, like great men, must keep their word. And so the question is, who will safeguard this nation, who will safeguard our people and our children? I need your support, I ask for your vote.

Perot,"To the millions of fine decent people who did the unthinkable and took their country back in their own hands and put me on the ballot, let me pledge to you that tonight is just the beginning. These next 2 weeks we will be going full steam ahead to make sure that you get a voice and that you get your country back. This Thursday night on ABC from 8:30 to 9, Friday night on NBC from 8 to 8:30, and Saturday night on CBS from 8 to 8:30, well be down in the trenches under the hood working on fixin the old car to get it back on the road. Now, the question is, can we win? Absolutely we can win, because its your country. Question really is who do you want in the White House. Its that simple. Now, you got to stop letting these people tell you who to vote for, you got to stop letting these folks in the press tell you youre throwing your vote away  you got to start using your own head. Then the question is, can we govern? I love that one. The we is you and me. You bet your hat we can govern because we will be in there together and we will figure out what to do, and you wont tolerate gridlock, you wont tolerate endless meandering and wandering around, and you wont tolerate non-performance. And, believe me, anybody that knows me understands I have a very low tolerance for non-performance also. Together we can get anything done. The president mentioned that you need the right person in a crisis. Well, folks, we got one, and that one is a financial crisis. Pretty simply, whos the best-qualified person up here on the stage to create jobs? Make your decision and vote on November the 3rd. I suggest you might consider somebody whos created jobs. Whos the best person to manage money? I suggest you pick a person whos successfully managed money. Whos the best person to get results and not talk? Look at the record and make your decision.

Brokaw,"Good evening from Belmont University in Nashville, Tennessee. Im Tom Brokaw of NBC News. And welcome to this second presidential debate, sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates. Tonights debate is the only one with a town hall format. The Gallup Organization chose 80 uncommitted voters from the Nashville area to be here with us tonight. And earlier today, each of them gave me a copy of their question for the candidates. From all of these questions  and from tens of thousands submitted online  I have selected a long list of excellent questions on domestic and foreign policy. Neither the commission nor the candidates have seen the questions. And although we wont be able to get to all of them tonight, we should have a wide-ranging discussion one month before the election. Each candidate will have two minutes to respond to a common question, and there will be a one-minute follow-up. The audience here in the hall has agreed to be polite, and attentive, no cheering or outbursts. Those of you at home, of course, are not so constrained. The only exception in the hall is right now, as it is my privilege to introduce the candidates, Senator Barack Obama of Illinois and Senator John McCain of Arizona. Gentlemen, we want to get underway immediately, if we can. Since you last met at Ole Miss 12 days ago, the world has changed a great deal, and not for the better. We still dont know where the bottom is at this time. As you might expect, many of the questions that we have from here in the hall tonight and from online have to do with the American economy and, in fact, with global economic conditions. I understand that you flipped a coin. And, Senator Obama, you will begin tonight. And were going to have our first question from over here in Section A from Alan Schaefer (ph).",2008-10-07,Moderator
Obama,"Well, Alan (ph), thank you very much for the question. I want to first, obviously, thank Belmont University, Tom, thank you, and to all of you who are participating tonight and those of you who sent e-mail questions in. I think everybody knows now we are in the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. And a lot of you I think are worried about your jobs, your pensions, your retirement accounts, your ability to send your child or your grandchild to college. And I believe this is a final verdict on the failed economic policies of the last eight years, strongly promoted by President Bush and supported by Senator McCain, that essentially said that we should strip away regulations, consumer protections, let the market run wild, and prosperity would rain down on all of us. It hasnt worked out that way. And so now weve got to take some decisive action.",2008-10-07,Democrat
Obama,"Now, step one was a rescue package that was passed last week. Weve got to make sure that works properly. And that means strong oversight, making sure that investors, taxpayers are getting their money back and treated as investors. It means that we are cracking down on CEOs and making sure that theyre not getting bonuses or golden parachutes as a consequence of this package. And, in fact, we just found out that AIG, a company that got a bailout, just a week after they got help went on a $400,000 junket. And Ill tell you what, the Treasury should demand that money back and those executives should be fired. But thats only step one. The middle-class need a rescue package. And that means tax cuts for the middle-class. It means help for homeowners so that they can stay in their homes. It means that we are helping state and local governments set up road projects and bridge projects that keep people in their jobs. And then long-term weve got to fix our health care system, weve got to fix our energy system that is putting such an enormous burden on families. You need somebody working for you and youve got to have somebody in Washington who is thinking about the middle class and not just those who can afford to hire lobbyists.",2008-10-07,Democrat
Brokaw,Senator McCain?,2008-10-07,Moderator
Mccain,"Well, thank you, Tom. Thank you, Belmont University. And Senator Obama, its good to be with you at a town hall meeting. And, Alan (ph), thank you for your question. You go to the heart of Americas worries tonight. Americans are angry, theyre upset, and theyre a little fearful. Its our job to fix the problem. Now, I have a plan to fix this problem and it has got to do with energy independence. Weve got to stop sending $700 billion a year to countries that dont want us very  like us very much. We have to keep Americans taxes low. All Americans taxes low. Lets not raise taxes on anybody today. We obviously have to stop this spending spree thats going on in Washington. Do you know that weve laid a $10 trillion debt on these young Americans who are here with us tonight, $500 billion of it we owe to China? Weve got to have a package of reforms and it has got to lead to reform prosperity and peace in the world. And I think that this problem has become so severe, as you know, that were going to have to do something about home values. You know that home values of retirees continues to decline and people are no longer able to afford their mortgage payments. As president of the United States, Alan, I would order the secretary of the treasury to immediately buy up the bad home loan mortgages in America and renegotiate at the new value of those homes  at the diminished value of those homes and let people be able to make those  be able to make those payments and stay in their homes. Is it expensive? Yes. But we all know, my friends, until we stabilize home values in America, were never going to start turning around and creating jobs and fixing our economy. And weve got to give some trust and confidence back to America. I know how the do that, my friends. And its my proposal, its not Senator Obamas proposal, its not President Bushs proposal. But I know how to get America working again, restore our economy and take care of working Americans. Thank you.",2008-10-07,Republican
Brokaw,"Senator, we have one minute for a discussion here. Obviously the powers of the treasury secretary have been greatly expanded. The most powerful officer in the cabinet now. Hank Paulson says he wont stay on. Who do you have in mind to appoint to that very important post?",2008-10-07,Moderator
Mccain,"Not you, Tom.",2008-10-07,Republican
Brokaw,"No, with good reason.",2008-10-07,Moderator
Mccain,"You know, thats a tough question and theres a lot of qualified Americans. But I think the first criteria, Tom, would have to be somebody who immediately Americans identify with, immediately say, we can trust that individual. A supporter of Senator Obamas is Warren Buffett. He has already weighed in and helped stabilize some of the difficulties in the markets and with companies and corporations, institutions today. I like Meg Whitman, she knows what its like to be out there in the marketplace. She knows how to create jobs. Meg Whitman was CEO of a company that started with 12 people and is now 1.3 million people in America make their living off eBay. Maybe somebody here has done a little business with them. But the point is its going to have to be somebody who inspires trust and confidence. Because the problem in America today to a large extent, Tom, is that we dont have trust and confidence in our institutions because of the corruption on Wall Street and the greed and excess and the cronyism in Washington, D.C.",2008-10-07,Republican
Brokaw,"All right. Senator McCain  Senator Obama, who do you have in mind for treasury secretary?",2008-10-07,Moderator
Obama,"Well, Warren would be a pretty good choice  Warren Buffett, and Im pleased to have his support. But there are other folks out there. The key is making sure that the next treasury secretary understands that its not enough just to help those at the top. Prosperity is not just going to trickle down. Weve got to help the middle class.",2008-10-07,Democrat
Obama,"And weve  you know, Senator McCain and I have some fundamental disagreements on the economy, starting with Senator McCains statement earlier that he thought the fundamentals of the economy were sound. Part of the problem here is that for many of you, wages and incomes have flat-lined. For many of you, it is getting harder and harder to save, harder and harder to retire. And thats why, for example, on tax policy, what I want to do is provide a middle class tax cut to 95 percent of working Americans, those who are working two jobs, people who are not spending enough time with their kids, because they are struggling to make ends meet. Senator McCain is right that weve got to stabilize housing prices. But underlying that is loss of jobs and loss of income. Thats something that the next treasury secretary is going to have to work on.",2008-10-07,Democrat
Brokaw,"Senator Obama, thank you very much. May I remind both of you, if I can, that were operating under rules that you signed off on and when we have a discussion, it really is to be confined within about a minute or so. Were going to go now, Senator McCain, to the next question from you from the hall here, and it comes from Oliver Clark (ph), who is over here in section F.",2008-10-07,Moderator
Mccain,"Well, thank you, Oliver, and thats an excellent question, because as you just described it, bailout, when I believe that its rescue, because  because of the greed and excess in Washington and Wall Street, Main Street was paying a very heavy price, and we know that. I left my campaign and suspended it to go back to Washington to make sure that there were additional protections for the taxpayer in the form of good oversight, in the form of taxpayers being the first to be paid back when our economy recovers  and it will recover  and a number of other measures. But you know, one of the real catalysts, really the match that lit this fire was Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Ill bet you, you may never even have heard of them before this crisis. But you know, theyre the ones that, with the encouragement of Senator Obama and his cronies and his friends in Washington, that went out and made all these risky loans, gave them to people that could never afford to pay back. And you know, there were some of us that stood up two years ago and said weve got to enact legislation to fix this. Weve got to stop this greed and excess. Meanwhile, the Democrats in the Senate and some  and some members of Congress defended what Fannie and Freddie were doing. They resisted any change. Meanwhile, they were getting all kinds of money in campaign contributions. Senator Obama was the second highest recipient of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac money in history  in history. So this rescue package means that we will stabilize markets, we will shore up these institutions. But its not enough. Thats why were going to have to go out into the housing market and were going to have to buy up these bad loans and were going to have to stabilize home values, and that way, Americans, like Alan, can realize the American dream and stay in their home. But Fannie and Freddie were the catalysts, the match that started this forest fire. There were some of us  there were some of us that stood up against it. There were others who took a hike.",2008-10-07,Republican
Brokaw,Senator Obama?,2008-10-07,Moderator
Obama,"Well, Oliver, first, let me tell you whats in the rescue package for you. Right now, the credit markets are frozen up and what that means, as a practical matter, is that small businesses and some large businesses just cant get loans. If they cant get a loan, that means that they cant make payroll. If they cant make payroll, then they may end up having to shut their doors and lay people off. And if you imagine just one company trying to deal with that, now imagine a million companies all across the country. So it could end up having an adverse effect on everybody, and thats why we had to take action. But we shouldnt have been there in the first place. Now, Ive got to correct a little bit of Senator McCains history, not surprisingly. Lets, first of all, understand that the biggest problem in this whole process was the deregulation of the financial system. Senator McCain, as recently as March, bragged about the fact that he is a deregulator. On the other hand, two years ago, I said that weve got a sub-prime lending crisis that has to be dealt with. I wrote to Secretary Paulson, I wrote to Federal Reserve Chairman Bernanke, and told them this is something we have to deal with, and nobody did anything about it. A year ago, I went to Wall Street and said weve got to reregulate, and nothing happened.",2008-10-07,Democrat
Obama,"And Senator McCain during that period said that we should keep on deregulating because thats how the free enterprise system works. Now, with respect to Fannie Mae, what Senator McCain didnt mention is the fact that this bill that he talked about wasnt his own bill. He jumped on it a year after it had been introduced and it never got passed. And I never promoted Fannie Mae. In fact, Senator McCains campaign chairmans firm was a lobbyist on behalf of Fannie Mae, not me. This is not the end of the process; this is the beginning of the process. And thats why its going to be so important for us to work with homeowners to make sure that they can stay in their homes. The secretary already has the power to do that in the rescue package, but it hasnt been exercised yet. And the next president has to make sure that the next Treasury secretary is thinking about how to strengthen you as a home buyer, you as a homeowner, and not simply think about bailing out banks on Wall Street.",2008-10-07,Democrat
Brokaw,"Senator Obama, time for a discussion. Im going to begin with you. Are you saying to Mr. Clark (ph) and to the other members of the American television audience that the American economy is going to get much worse before it gets better and they ought to be prepared for that?",2008-10-07,Moderator
Obama,"No, I am confident about the American economy. But we are going to have to have some leadership from Washington that not only sets out much better regulations for the financial system. The problem is we still have a archaic, 20th-century regulatory system for 21st-century financial markets. Were going to have to coordinate with other countries to make sure that whatever actions we take work. But most importantly, were going to have to help ordinary families be able to stay in their homes, make sure that they can pay their bills, deal with critical issues like health care and energy, and were going to have to change the culture in Washington so that lobbyists and special interests arent driving the process and your voices arent being drowned out.",2008-10-07,Democrat
Brokaw,"Senator McCain, in all candor, do you think the economy is going to get worse before it gets better?",2008-10-07,Moderator
Mccain,"I think it depends on what we do. I think if we act effectively, if we stabilize the housing market  which I believe we can, if we go out and buy up these bad loans, so that people can have a new mortgage at the new value of their home  I think if we get rid of the cronyism and special interest influence in Washington so we can act more effectively. My friend, Id like you to see the letter that a group of senators and I wrote warning exactly of this crisis. Senator Obamas name was not on that letter. The point is  the point is that we can fix our economy. Americans workers are the best in the world. Theyre the fundamental aspect of Americas economy. Theyre the most innovative. Theyre the best  theyre most  have best  were the best exporters. Were the best importers. Theyre most effective. They are the best workers in the world. And weve got to give them a chance. Theyve got  weve got to give them a chance to do their best again. And they are the innocent bystanders here in what is the biggest financial crisis and challenge of our time. We can do it.",2008-10-07,Republican

Obama,"Well, look, I understand your frustration and your cynicism, because while youve been carrying out your responsibilities  most of the people here, youve got a family budget. If less money is coming in, you end up making cuts. Maybe you dont go out to dinner as much. Maybe you put off buying a new car. Thats not what happens in Washington. And youre right. There is a lot of blame to go around. But I think its important just to remember a little bit of history. When George Bush came into office, we had surpluses. And now we have half-a-trillion-dollar deficit annually. When George Bush came into office, our debt  national debt was around $5 trillion. Its now over $10 trillion. Weve almost doubled it. And so while its true that nobodys completely innocent here, we have had over the last eight years the biggest increases in deficit spending and national debt in our history. And Senator McCain voted for four out of five of those George Bush budgets. So heres what I would do. Im going to spend some money on the key issues that weve got to work on.",2008-10-07,Democrat
Obama,"You know, you may have seen your health care premiums go up. Weve got to reform health care to help you and your budget. We are going to have to deal with energy because we cant keep on borrowing from the Chinese and sending money to Saudi Arabia. We are mortgaging our childrens future. Weve got to have a different energy plan. Weve got to invest in college affordability. So were going to have to make some investments, but weve also got to make spending cuts. And what Ive proposed, youll hear Senator McCain say, well, hes proposing a whole bunch of new spending, but actually Im cutting more than Im spending so that it will be a net spending cut. The key is whether or not weve got priorities that are working for you as opposed to those who have been dictating the policy in Washington lately, and thats mostly lobbyists and special interests. Weve got to put an end to that.",2008-10-07,Democrat
Brokaw,Senator McCain?,2008-10-07,Moderator
Mccain,"Well, Theresa (ph), thank you. And I can see why you feel that cynicism and mistrust, because the system in Washington is broken. And I have been a consistent reformer. I have advocated and taken on the special interests, whether they be the big money people by reaching across the aisle and working with Senator Feingold on campaign finance reform, whether it being a variety of other issues, working with Senator Lieberman on trying to address climate change. I have a clear record of bipartisanship. The situation today cries out for bipartisanship. Senator Obama has never taken on his leaders of his party on a single issue. And we need to reform. And so lets look at our records as well as our rhetoric. Thats really part of your mistrust here. And now I suggest that maybe you go to some of these organizations that are the watchdogs of what we do, like the Citizens Against Government Waste or the National Taxpayers Union or these other organizations that watch us all the time. I think you have to look at my record and you have to look at his. Then you have to look at our proposals for our economy, not $860 billion in new spending, but for the kinds of reforms that keep people in their jobs, get middle-income Americans working again, and getting our economy moving again. Youre going to be examining our proposals tonight and in the future, and energy independence is a way to do that, is one of them. And drilling offshore and nuclear power are two vital elements of that. And Ive been supporting those and I know how to fix this economy, and eliminate our dependence on foreign oil, and stop sending $700 billion a year overseas.",2008-10-07,Republican

Brokaw,"The three  health care, energy, and entitlement reform: Social Security and Medicare. In what order would you put them in terms of priorities?",2008-10-07,Moderator
Mccain,"I think you can work on all three at once, Tom. I think its very important that we reform our entitlement programs. My friends, we are not going to be able to provide the same benefit for present-day workers that we are going  that present-day retirees have today. Were going to have to sit down across the table, Republican and Democrat, as we did in 1983 between Ronald Reagan and Tip ONeill. I know how to do that. I have a clear record of reaching across the aisle, whether it be Joe Lieberman or Russ Feingold or Ted Kennedy or others. Thats my clear record. We can work on nuclear power plants. Build a whole bunch of them, create millions of new jobs. We have to have all of the above, alternative fuels, wind, tide, solar, natural gas, clean coal technology. All of these things we can do as Americans and we can take on this mission and we can overcome it.",2008-10-07,Republican
Mccain,"My friends, some of this $700 billion ends up in the hands of terrorist organizations. As far as health care is concerned, obviously, everyone is struggling to make sure that they can afford their premiums and that they can have affordable and available health care. Thats the next issue. But we can do them all at once. Theres no  and we have to do them all at once. All three you mentioned are compelling national security requirements.",2008-10-07,Republican
Brokaw,"Im trying to play by the rules that you all established. One minute for discussion. Senator Obama, if you would give us your list of priorities, there are some real questions about whether everything can be done at once.",2008-10-07,Moderator
Obama,"Were going to have to prioritize, just like a family has to prioritize. Now, Ive listed the things that I think have to be at the top of the list. Energy we have to deal with today, because youre paying $3.80 here in Nashville for gasoline, and it could go up. And its a strain on your family budget, but its also bad for our national security, because countries like Russia and Venezuela and, you know, in some cases, countries like Iran, are benefiting from higher oil prices. So weve got to deal with that right away. Thats why Ive called for an investment of $15 billion a year over 10 years. Our goal should be, in 10 years time, we are free of dependence on Middle Eastern oil. And we can do it. Now, when JFK said were going to the Moon in 10 years, nobody was sure how to do it, but we understood that, if the American people make a decision to do something, it gets done. So that would be priority number one. Health care is priority number two, because that broken health care system is bad not only for families, but its making our businesses less competitive. And, number three, weve got to deal with education so that our young people are competitive in a global economy. But just one point I want to make, Tom. Senator McCain mentioned looking at our records. We do need to look at our records. Senator McCain likes to talk about earmarks a lot. And thats important. I want to go line by line through every item in the federal budget and eliminate programs that dont work and make sure that those that do work, work better and cheaper. But understand this: We also have to look at where some of our tax revenues are going. So when Senator McCain proposes a $300 billion tax cut, a continuation not only of the Bush tax cuts, but an additional $200 billion that hes going to give to big corporations, including big oil companies, $4 billion worth, thats money out of the system. And so weve got to prioritize both our spending side and our tax policies to make sure that theyre working for you. Thats what Im going to do as president of the United States.",2008-10-07,Democrat
Brokaw,"All right, gentlemen, I want to just remind you one more time about time. Were going to have a larger deficit than the federal government does if we dont get this under control here before too long. Senator McCain, for you, we have our first question from the Internet tonight. A child of the Depression, 78-year-old Fiora (ph) from Chicago.",2008-10-07,Moderator
Mccain,"Well, Fiora (ph), Im going to ask the American people to understand that there are some programs that we may have to eliminate. I first proposed a long time ago that we would have to examine every agency and every bureaucracy of government. And were going to have to eliminate those that arent working. I know a lot of them that arent working. One of them is in defense spending, because Ive taken on some of the defense contractors. I saved the taxpayers $6.8 billion in a deal for an Air Force tanker that was done in a corrupt fashion. I believe that we have to eliminate the earmarks. And sometimes those projects, not  not the overhead projector that Senator Obama asked for, but some of them that are really good projects, will have  will have to be eliminated, as well. And theyll have to undergo the same scrutiny that all projects should in competition with others. So were going to have to tell the American people that spending is going to have to be cut in America. And I recommend a spending freeze that  except for defense, Veterans Affairs, and some other vital programs, well just have to have across-the-board freeze. And some of those programs may not grow as much as we would like for them to, but we can establish priorities with full transparency, with full knowledge of the American people, and full consultation, not done behind closed doors and shoving earmarks in the middle of the night into programs that we dont even  sometimes we dont even know about until months later. And, by the way, I want to go back a second.",2008-10-07,Republican
Mccain,"Look, we can attack health care and energy at the same time. Were not  were not  were not rifle shots here. We are Americans. We can, with the participation of all Americans, work together and solve these problems together. Frankly, Im not going to tell that person without health insurance that, Im sorry, youll have to wait. Im going to tell you Americans well get to work right away and well get to work together, and we can get them all done, because thats what America has been doing.",2008-10-07,Republican
Brokaw,"Senator McCain, thank you very much.",2008-10-07,Moderator
Obama,"You know, a lot of you remember the tragedy of 9/11 and where you were on that day and, you know, how all of the country was ready to come together and make enormous changes to make us not only safer, but to make us a better country and a more unified country. And President Bush did some smart things at the outset, but one of the opportunities that was missed was, when he spoke to the American people, he said, Go out and shop. That wasnt the kind of call to service that I think the American people were looking for. And so its important to understand that the  I think the American people are hungry for the kind of leadership that is going to tackle these problems not just in government, but outside of government. And lets take the example of energy, which we already spoke about. There is going to be the need for each and every one of us to start thinking about how we use energy. I believe in the need for increased oil production. Were going to have to explore new ways to get more oil, and that includes offshore drilling. It includes telling the oil companies, that currently have 68 million acres that theyre not using, that either you use them or you lose them. Were going to have to develop clean coal technology and safe ways to store nuclear energy. But each and every one of us can start thinking about how can we save energy in our homes, in our buildings. And one of the things I want to do is make sure that were providing incentives so that you can buy a fuel efficient car thats made right here in the United States of America, not in Japan or South Korea, making sure that you are able to weatherize your home or make your business more fuel efficient. And thats going to require effort from each and every one of us. And the last point I just want to make. I think the young people of America are especially interested in how they can serve, and thats one of the reasons why Im interested in doubling the Peace Corps, making sure that we are creating a volunteer corps all across this country that can be involved in their community, involved in military service, so that military families and our troops are not the only ones bearing the burden of renewing America. Thats something that all of us have to be involved with and that requires some leadership from Washington.",2008-10-07,Democrat
Brokaw,"Senator Obama, as we begin, very quickly, our discussion period, President Bush, youll remember, last summer, said that Wall Street got drunk. A lot of people now look back and think the federal government got drunk and, in fact, the American consumers got drunk.",2008-10-07,Moderator
Obama,"Well, I think it starts with Washington. Weve got to show that weve got good habits, because if were running up trillion dollar debts that were passing on to the next generation, then a lot of people are going to think, Well, you know what? Theres easy money out there. It means  and I have to, again, repeat this. It means looking (ph) at the spending side, but also at the revenue side. I mean, Senator McCain has been talking tough about earmarks, and thats good, but earmarks account for about $18 billion of our budget. Now, when Senator McCain is proposing tax cuts that would give the average Fortune 500 CEO an additional $700,000 in tax cuts, thats not sharing a burden. And so part of the problem, I think, for a lot of people who are listening here tonight is they dont feel as if they are sharing the burden with other folks. I mean, you know, its tough to ask a teacher whos making $30,000 or $35,000 a year to tighten her belt when people who are making much more than her are living pretty high on the hog. And thats why I think its important for the president to set a tone that says all of us are going to contribute, all of us are going to make sacrifices, and it means that, yes, we may have to cut some spending, although I disagree with Senator McCain about an across-the- board freeze. Thats an example of an unfair burden sharing. Thats using a hatchet to cut the federal budget.",2008-10-07,Democrat

Brokaw,Senator McCain?,2008-10-07,Moderator
Mccain,"Well, you know, nailing down Senator Obamas various tax proposals is like nailing Jell-O to the wall. There has been five or six of them and if you wait long enough, there will probably be another one. But he wants to raise taxes. My friends, the last president to raise taxes during tough economic times was Herbert Hoover, and he practiced protectionism as well, which Im sure well get to at some point. You know, last year up to this time, weve lost 700,000 jobs in America. The only bright spot is that over 300,000 jobs have been created by small businesses. Senator Obamas secret that you dont know is that his tax increases will increase taxes on 50 percent of small business revenue. Small businesses across America will have to cut jobs and will have their taxes increase and wont be able to hire because of Senator Obamas tax policies. You know, he said some time ago, he said he would forgo his tax increases if the economy was bad. Ive got some news, Senator Obama, the news is bad. So lets not raise anybodys taxes, my friends, and make it be very clear to you I am not in favor of tax cuts for the wealthy. I am in favor of leaving the tax rates alone and reducing the tax burden on middle-income Americans by doubling your tax exemption for every child from $3,500 to $7,000. To giving every American a $5,000 refundable tax credit and go out and get the health insurance you want rather than mandates and fines for small businesses, as Senator Obamas plan calls for.

Brokaw,"There are lots of issues that we are going to be dealing with here tonight. And we have a question from Langdon (ph) in Ballston Spa, New York, and thats about huge unfunded obligations for Social Security, Medicare, and other entitlement programs that will soon eat up all of the revenue thats in place and then go into a deficit position. Since the rules are pretty loose here, Im going to add my own to this one. Instead of having a discussion, let me ask you as a coda to that. Would you give Congress a date certain to reform Social Security and Medicare within two years after you take office? Because in a bipartisan way, everyone agrees, thats a big ticking time bomb that will eat us up maybe even more than the mortgage crisis.",2008-10-07,Moderator
Obama,"Well, Tom, were going to have to take on entitlements and I think weve got to do it quickly. Were going to have a lot of work to do, so I cant guarantee that were going to do it in the next two years, but Id like to do in the my first term as president. But I think its important to understand, were not going to solve Social Security and Medicare unless we understand the rest of our tax policies. And you know, Senator McCain, I think the Straight Talk Express lost a wheel on that one. So lets be clear about my tax plan and Senator McCains, because were not going to be able to deal with entitlements unless we understand the revenues coming in. I want to provide a tax cut for 95 percent of Americans, 95 percent. If you make less than a quarter of a million dollars a year, you will not see a single dime of your taxes go up. If you make $200,000 a year or less, your taxes will go down. Now, Senator McCain talks about small businesses. Only a few percent of small businesses make more than $250,000 a year. So the vast majority of small businesses would get a tax cut under my plan. And we provide a 50 percent tax credit so that they can buy health insurance for their workers, because there are an awful lot of small businesses that I meet across America that want to do right by their workers but they just cant afford it. Some small business owners, a lot of them, cant even afford health insurance for themselves. Now, in contrast, Senator McCain wants to give a $300 billion tax cut, $200 billion of it to the largest corporations and a hundred thousand of it  a hundred billion of it going to people like CEOs on Wall Street. He wants to give average Fortune 500 CEO an additional $700,000 in tax cuts. That is not fair. And it doesnt work.",2008-10-07,Democrat
Obama,"Now, if we get our tax policies right so that theyre good for the middle class, if we reverse the policies of the last eight years that got us into this fix in the first place and that Senator McCain supported, then we are going to be in a position to deal with Social Security and deal with Medicare, because we will have a health care plan that actually works for you, reduces spending and costs over the long term, and Social Security that is stable and solvent for all Americans and not just some.",2008-10-07,Democrat

Brokaw,And Medicare.,2008-10-07,Moderator
Mccain," tough decisions. I want to get to Medicare in a second. Social Security is not that tough. We know what the problems are, my friends, and we know what the fixes are. Weve got to sit down together across the table. Its been done before. I saw it done with our  our wonderful Ronald Reagan, a conservative from California, and the liberal Democrat Tip ONeill from Massachusetts. Thats what we need more of, and thats what Ive done in Washington. Senator Obama has never taken on his party leaders on a single major issue. Ive taken them on. Im not too popular sometimes with my own party, much less his. So Medicare, its going to be a little tougher. Its going to be a little tougher because were talking about very complex and difficult issues. My friends, what we have to do with Medicare is have a commission, have the smartest people in America come together, come up with recommendations, and then, like the base-closing commission idea we had, then we should have Congress vote up or down. Lets not let them fool with it anymore. Theres too much special interests and too many lobbyists working there. So lets have  and lets have the American people say, Fix it for us. Now, just back on this  on this tax, you know, again, its back to our first question here about rhetoric and record. Senator Obama has voted 94 times to either increase your taxes or against tax cuts. Thats his record. So lets look at our record. Ive fought higher taxes. I have fought excess spending. I have fought to reform government. Lets look at our records, my friends, and then listen to my vision for the future of America. And well get our economy going again. And our best days are ahead of us.",2008-10-07,Republican

Mccain,"Well, thank you. Look, we are in tough economic times; we all know that. And lets keep  never forget the struggle that Americans are in today. But when we can  when we have an issue that we may hand our children and our grandchildren a damaged planet, I have disagreed strongly with the Bush administration on this issue. I traveled all over the world looking at the effects of greenhouse gas emissions, Joe Lieberman and I. And I introduced the first legislation, and we forced votes on it. Thats the good news, my friends. The bad news is we lost. But we kept the debate going, and we kept this issue to  to posing to Americans the danger that climate change opposes. Now, how  whats  whats the best way of fixing it? Nuclear power. Senator Obama says that it has to be safe or disposable or something like that. Look, I  I was on Navy ships that had nuclear power plants. Nuclear power is safe, and its clean, and it creates hundreds of thousands of jobs. And  and I know that we can reprocess the spent nuclear fuel. The Japanese, the British, the French do it. And we can do it, too. Senator Obama has opposed that. We can move forward, and clean up our climate, and develop green technologies, and alternate  alternative energies for  for hybrid, for hydrogen, for battery-powered cars, so that we can clean up our environment and at the same time get our economy going by creating millions of jobs. We can do that, we as Americans, because were the best innovators, were the best producers, and 95 percent of the people who are our market live outside of the United States of America.",2008-10-07,Republican
Brokaw,Senator Obama?,2008-10-07,Moderator
Obama,This is one of the biggest challenges of our times.,2008-10-07,Democrat
Obama,"And it is absolutely critical that we understand this is not just a challenge, its an opportunity, because if we create a new energy economy, we can create five million new jobs, easily, here in the United States. It can be an engine that drives us into the future the same way the computer was the engine for economic growth over the last couple of decades. And we can do it, but were going to have to make an investment. The same way the computer was originally invented by a bunch of government scientists who were trying to figure out, for defense purposes, how to communicate, weve got to understand that this is a national security issue, as well. And thats why weve got to make some investments and Ive called for investments in solar, wind, geothermal. Contrary to what Senator McCain keeps on saying, I favor nuclear power as one component of our overall energy mix. But this is another example where I think it is important to look at the record. Senator McCain and I actually agree on something. He said a while back that the big problem with energy is that for 30 years, politicians in Washington havent done anything. What Senator McCain doesnt mention is hes been there 26 of them. And during that time, he voted 23 times against alternative fuels, 23 times. So its easy to talk about this stuff during a campaign, but its important for us to understand that it requires a sustained effort from the next president. One last point I want to make on energy. Senator McCain talks a lot about drilling, and thats important, but we have three percent of the worlds oil reserves and we use 25 percent of the worlds oil. So what that means is that we cant simply drill our way out of the problem. And were not going to be able to deal with the climate crisis if our only solution is to use more fossil fuels that create global warming. Were going to have to come up with alternatives, and that means that the United States government is working with the private sector to fund the kind of innovation that we can then export to countries like China that also need energy and are setting up one coal power plant a week. Weve got to make sure that were giving them the energy that they need or helping them to create the energy that they need.",2008-10-07,Democrat

Mccain,"I think pure research and development investment on the part of the United States government is certainly appropriate. I think once it gets into productive stages, that we ought to, obviously, turn it over to the private sector. By the way, my friends, I know you grow a little weary with this back-and-forth. It was an energy bill on the floor of the Senate loaded down with goodies, billions for the oil companies, and it was sponsored by Bush and Cheney. You know who voted for it? You might never know. That one. You know who voted against it? Me. I have fought time after time against these pork barrel  these bills that come to the floor and they have all kinds of goodies and all kinds of things in them for everybody and they buy off the votes. I vote against them, my friends. I vote against them. But the point is, also, on oil drilling, oil drilling offshore now is vital so that we can bridge the gap. We can bridge the gap between imported oil, which is a national security issue, as well as any other, and it will reduce the price of a barrel of oil, because when people know theres a greater supply, then the cost of that will go down. Thats fundamental economics. Weve got to drill offshore, my friends, and weve got to do it now, and we can do it. And as far as nuclear power is concerned, again, look at the record. Senator Obama has approved storage and reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel. And Ill stop, Tom, and you didnt even wave. Thanks.",2008-10-07,Republican
Brokaw,"Thank you very much, Senator. Next question for you, Senator Obama, and it comes from the E section over here and its from Lindsey Trellow (ph).",2008-10-07,Moderator
Obama,"Well, you know, as I travel around the country, this is one of the single most frequently asked issues that I get, is the issue of health care. It is breaking family budgets. I cant tell you how many people I meet who dont have health insurance. If youve got health insurance, most of you have seen your premiums double over the last eight years. And your co-payments and deductibles have gone up 30 percent just in the last year alone. If youre a small business, its a crushing burden. So one of the things that I have said from the start of this campaign is that we have a moral commitment as well as an economic imperative to do something about the health care crisis that so many families are facing. So heres what I would do. If youve got health care already, and probably the majority of you do, then you can keep your plan if you are satisfied with it. You can keep your choice of doctor. Were going to work with your employer to lower the cost of your premiums by up to $2,500 a year. And were going to do it by investing in prevention. Were going to do it by making sure that we use information technology so that medical records are actually on computers instead of you filling forms out in triplicate when you go to the hospital. That will reduce medical errors and reduce costs. If you dont have health insurance, youre going to be able to buy the same kind of insurance that Senator McCain and I enjoy as federal employees. Because theres a huge pool, we can drop the costs. And nobody will be excluded for pre-existing conditions, which is a huge problem. Now, Senator McCain has a different kind of approach. He says that hes going to give you a $5,000 tax credit. What he doesnt tell you is that he is going to tax your employer-based health care benefits for the first time ever. So what one hand giveth, the other hand taketh away. He would also strip away the ability of states to provide some of the regulations on insurance companies to make sure youre not excluded for pre-existing conditions or your mammograms are covered or your maternity is covered. And that is fundamentally the wrong way to go. In fact, just today business organizations like the United States Chamber of Commerce, which generally are pretty supportive of Republicans, said that this would lead to the unraveling of the employer-based health care system. That, I dont think, is the kind of change that we need. Weve got to have somebody who is fighting for patients and making sure that you get decent, affordable health care. And thats something that Im committed to doing as president.",2008-10-07,Democrat
Brokaw,Senator McCain?,2008-10-07,Moderator
Mccain,"Well, thank you for the question. You really identified one of the really major challenges that America faces. Co-payments go up, costs go up, skyrocketing costs, which make people less and less able to afford health insurance in America. And we need to do all of the things that are necessary to make it more efficient. Lets put health records online, that will reduce medical errors, as they call them. Lets have community health centers. Lets have walk-in clinics. Lets do a lot of things to impose efficiencies. But what is at stake here in this health care issue is the fundamental difference between myself and Senator Obama. As you notice, he starts talking about government. He starts saying, government will do this and government will do that, and then government will, and hell impose mandates. If youre a small business person and you dont insure your employees, Senator Obama will fine you. Will fine you. Thats remarkable. If youre a parent and youre struggling to get health insurance for your children, Senator Obama will fine you. I want to give every American a $5,000 refundable tax credit. They can take it anywhere, across state lines. Why not? Dont we go across state lines when we purchase other things in America? Of course its OK to go across state lines because in Arizona they may offer a better plan that suits you best than it does here in Tennessee. And if you do the math, those people who have employer-based health benefits, if you put the tax on it and you have whats left over and you add $5,000 that youre going to get as a refundable tax credit, do the math, 95 percent of the American people will have increased funds to go out and buy the insurance of their choice and to shop around and to get  all of those people will be covered except for those who have these gold-plated Cadillac kinds of policies. You know, like hair transplants, I might need one of those myself. But the point is that we have got to give people choice in America and not mandate things on them and give them the ability. Every parent I know would acquire health insurance for their children if they could. Obviously small business people want to give their employees health insurance. Of course they all want to do that. Weve got to give them the wherewithal to do it. We can do it by giving them, as a start, a $5,000 refundable tax credit to go around and get the health insurance policy of their choice.",2008-10-07,Republican
Brokaw,"Quick discussion. Is health care in America a privilege, a right, or a responsibility?",2008-10-07,Moderator
Mccain,"I think its a responsibility, in this respect, in that we should have available and affordable health care to every American citizen, to every family member. And with the plan that  that I have, that will do that. But government mandates I  Im always a little nervous about. But it is certainly my responsibility. It is certainly small-business people and others, and they understand that responsibility. American citizens understand that. Employers understand that. But they certainly are a little nervous when Senator Obama says, if you dont get the health care policy that I think you should have, then youre going to get fined. And, by the way, Senator Obama has never mentioned how much that fine might be. Perhaps we might find that out tonight.",2008-10-07,Republican
Obama,"Well, why dont  why dont  lets talk about this, Tom, because there was just a lot of stuff out there.",2008-10-07,Democrat
Brokaw,"Privilege, right or responsibility. Lets start with that.",2008-10-07,Moderator
Obama,"Well, I think it should be a right for every American. In a country as wealthy as ours, for us to have people who are going bankrupt because they cant pay their medical bills  for my mother to die of cancer at the age of 53 and have to spend the last months of her life in the hospital room arguing with insurance companies because theyre saying that this may be a pre-existing condition and they dont have to pay her treatment, theres something fundamentally wrong about that. So let me  let me just talk about this fundamental difference. And, Tom, I know that were under time constraints, but Senator McCain through a lot of stuff out there. Number one, let me just repeat, if youve got a health care plan that you like, you can keep it. All Im going to do is help you to lower the premiums on it. Youll still have choice of doctor. Theres no mandate involved. Small businesses are not going to have a mandate. What were going to give you is a 50 percent tax credit to help provide health care for those that you need. Now, its true that I say that you are going to have to make sure that your child has health care, because children are relatively cheap to insure and we dont want them going to the emergency room for treatable illnesses like asthma. And when Senator McCain says that he wants to provide children health care, what he doesnt mention is he voted against the expansion of the Childrens Health Insurance Program that is responsible for making sure that so many children who didnt have previously health insurance have it now. Now, the final point Ill make on this whole issue of government intrusion and mandates  it is absolutely true that I think it is important for government to crack down on insurance companies that are cheating their customers, that dont give you the fine print, so you end up thinking that youre paying for something and, when you finally get sick and you need it, youre not getting it. And the reason that its a problem to go shopping state by state, you know what insurance companies will do? They will find a state  maybe Arizona, maybe another state  where there are no requirements for you to get cancer screenings, where there are no requirements for you to have to get pre-existing conditions, and they will all set up shop there. Thats how in banking it works. Everybody goes to Delaware, because theyve got very  pretty loose laws when it comes to things like credit cards. And in that situation, what happens is, is that the protections you have, the consumer protections that you need, youre not going to have available to you. That is a fundamental difference that I have with Senator McCain. He believes in deregulation in every circumstance. Thats what weve been going through for the last eight years. It hasnt worked, and we need fundamental change.",2008-10-07,Democrat

And that is one of the challenges that America faces. But having said that, America  and well hear a lot of criticism. Ive heard a lot of criticism about America, and our national security policy, and all that, and much of that criticism is justified. But the fact is, America is the greatest force for good in the history of the world. My friends, we have gone to all four corners of the Earth and shed American blood in defense, usually, of somebody elses freedom and our own.",2008-10-07,Republican
Mccain,"So we are peacemakers and were peacekeepers. But the challenge is to know when the United States of American can beneficially effect the outcome of a crisis, when to go in and when not, when American military power is worth the expenditure of our most precious treasure. And that question can only be answered by someone with the knowledge and experience and the judgment, the judgment to know when our national security is not only at risk, but where the United States of America can make a difference in preventing genocide, in preventing the spread of terrorism, in doing the things that the United States has done, not always well, but weve done because were a nation of good. And I am convinced that my record, going back to my opposition from sending the Marines to Lebanon, to supporting our efforts in Kosovo and Bosnia and the first Gulf War, and my judgment, I think, is something that Im  a record that Im willing to stand on. Senator Obama was wrong about Iraq and the surge. He was wrong about Russia when they committed aggression against Georgia. And in his short career, he does not understand our national security challenges. We dont have time for on-the-job training, my friends.",2008-10-07,Republican

Obama,"Well, you know, Senator McCain, in the last debate and today, again, suggested that I dont understand. Its true. There are some things I dont understand. I dont understand how we ended up invading a country that had nothing to do with 9/11, while Osama Bin Laden and Al Qaeda are setting up base camps and safe havens to train terrorists to attack us. That was Senator McCains judgment and it was the wrong judgment. When Senator McCain was cheerleading the president to go into Iraq, he suggested it was going to be quick and easy, wed be greeted as liberators. That was the wrong judgment, and its been costly to us. So one of the difficulties with Iraq is that it has put an enormous strain, first of all, on our troops, obviously, and they have performed heroically and honorably and we owe them an extraordinary debt of gratitude. But its also put an enormous strain on our budget. Weve spent, so far, close to $700 billion and if we continue on the path that were on, as Senator McCain is suggesting, its going to go well over $1 trillion. Were spending $10 billion a month in Iraq at a time when the Iraqis have a $79 billion surplus, $79 billion. And we need that $10 billion a month here in the United States to put people back to work, to do all these wonderful things that Senator McCain suggested we should be doing, but has not yet explained how he would pay for. Now, Senator McCain and I do agree, this is the greatest nation on earth. We are a force of good in the world. But there has never been a nation in the history of the world that saw its economy decline and maintained its military superiority. And the strains that have been placed on our alliances around the world and the respect thats been diminished over the last eight years has constrained us being able to act on something like the genocide in Darfur, because we dont have the resources or the allies to do everything that we should be doing. Thats going to change when Im president, but we cant change it unless we fundamentally change Senator McCains and George Bushs foreign policy. It has not worked for America.",2008-10-07,Democrat
Brokaw,"Senator Obama, let me ask you if  lets see if we can establish tonight the Obama doctrine and the McCain doctrine for the use of United States combat forces in situations where theres a humanitarian crisis, but it does not affect our national security. Take the Congo, where 4.5 million people have died since 1998, or take Rwanda in the earlier dreadful days, or Somalia.",2008-10-07,Moderator
Obama,"Well, we may not always have national security issues at stake, but we have moral issues at stake.

So when genocide is happening, when ethnic cleansing is happening somewhere around the world and we stand idly by, that diminishes us.",2008-10-07,Democrat
Obama,"And so I do believe that we have to consider it as part of our interests, our national interests, in intervening where possible. But understand that theres a lot of cruelty around the world. Were not going to be able to be everywhere all the time. Thats why its so important for us to be able to work in concert with our allies. Lets take the example of Darfur just for a moment. Right now theres a peacekeeping force that has been set up and we have African Union troops in Darfur to stop a genocide that has killed hundreds of thousands of people. We could be providing logistical support, setting up a no-fly zone at relatively little cost to us, but we can only do it if we can help mobilize the international community and lead. And thats what I intend to do when Im president.",2008-10-07,Democrat
Brokaw,"Senator McCain, the McCain Doctrine, if you will.",2008-10-07,Moderator
Mccain,"Well, let me just follow up, my friends. If we had done what Senator Obama wanted done in Iraq, and that was set a date for withdrawal, which General Petraeus, our chief  chairman of our Joint Chiefs of Staff said would be a very dangerous course to take for America, then we would have had a wider war, we would have been back, Iranian influence would have increased, al Qaeda would have re- established a base. There was a lot at stake there, my friends. And I can tell you right now that Senator Obama would have brought our troops home in defeat. Ill bring them home with victory and with honor and that is a fundamental difference. The United States of America, Tom, is the greatest force for good, as I said. And we must do whatever we can to prevent genocide, whatever we can to prevent these terrible calamities that we have said never again. But it also has to be tempered with our ability to beneficially affect the situation. That requires a cool hand at the tiller. This requires a person who understands what our  the limits of our capability are. We went in to Somalia as a peacemaking organization, we ended up trying to be  excuse me, as a peacekeeping organization, we ended up trying to be peacemakers and we ended up having to withdraw in humiliation. In Lebanon, I stood up to President Reagan, my hero, and said, if we send Marines in there, how can we possibly beneficially affect this situation? And said we shouldnt. Unfortunately, almost 300 brave young Marines were killed. So you have to temper your decisions with the ability to beneficially affect the situation and realize youre sending Americas most precious asset, American blood, into harms way. And, again, I know those situations. Ive been in them all my life. And I can tell you right now the security of your young men and women who are serving in the military are my first priority right after our nations security. And I may have to make those tough decisions. But I wont take them lightly. And I understand that we have to say never again to a Holocaust and never again to Rwanda. But we had also better be darn sure we dont leave and make the situation worse, thereby exacerbating our reputation and our ability to address crises in other parts of the world.",2008-10-07,Republican

Obama,"Katie, its a terrific question and we have a difficult situation in Pakistan. I believe that part of the reason we have a difficult situation is because we made a bad judgment going into Iraq in the first place when we hadnt finished the job of hunting down bin Laden and crushing al Qaeda. So what happened was we got distracted, we diverted resources, and ultimately bin Laden escaped, set up base camps in the mountains of Pakistan in the northwest provinces there. They are now raiding our troops in Afghanistan, destabilizing the situation. Theyre stronger now than at any time since 2001. And thats why I think its so important for us to reverse course, because thats the central front on terrorism. They are plotting to kill Americans right now. As Secretary Gates, the defense secretary, said, the war against terrorism began in that region and thats where it will end. So part of the reason I think its so important for us to end the war in Iraq is to be able to get more troops into Afghanistan, put more pressure on the Afghan government to do what it needs to do, eliminate some of the drug trafficking thats funding terrorism. But I do believe that we have to change our policies with Pakistan. We cant coddle, as we did, a dictator, give him billions of dollars and then hes making peace treaties with the Taliban and militants.",2008-10-07,Democrat

Mccain,"Well, Katie (ph), thank you. You know, my hero is a guy named Teddy Roosevelt. Teddy Roosevelt used to say walk softly  talk softly, but carry a big stick. Senator Obama likes to talk loudly. In fact, he said he wants to announce that hes going to attack Pakistan. Remarkable. You know, if you are a country and youre trying to gain the support of another country, then you want to do everything you can that they would act in a cooperative fashion. When you announce that youre going to launch an attack into another country, its pretty obvious that you have the effect that it had in Pakistan: It turns public opinion against us. Now, let me just go back with you very briefly. We drove the Russians out with  the Afghan freedom fighters drove the Russians out of Afghanistan, and then we made a most serious mistake. We washed our hands of Afghanistan. The Taliban came back in, Al Qaida, we then had the situation that required us to conduct the Afghan war. Now, our relations with Pakistan are critical, because the border areas are being used as safe havens by the Taliban and Al Qaida and other extremist organizations, and we have to get their support. Now, General Petraeus had a strategy, the same strategy  very, very different, because of the conditions and the situation  but the same fundamental strategy that succeeded in Iraq. And that is to get the support of the people. We need to help the Pakistani government go into Waziristan, where I visited, a very rough country, and  and get the support of the people, and get them to work with us and turn against the cruel Taliban and others. And by working and coordinating our efforts together, not threatening to attack them, but working with them, and where necessary use force, but talk softly, but carry a big stick.",2008-10-07,Republican

We have to double the size of the Afghan army. We have to have a streamlined NATO command structure. We have to do a lot of things. We have to work much more closely with the Pakistanis. But most importantly, we have to have the same strategy, which Senator Obama said wouldnt work, couldnt work, still fails to admit that he was wrong about Iraq. He still will not admit that he was wrong about the strategy of the surge in Iraq, and thats the same kind of strategy of go out and secure and hold and allow people to live normal lives.

But have no doubt that Russias behavior is certainly outside the norms of behavior that we would expect for nations which are very wealthy, as Russia has become, because of their petro dollars. Now, long ago, I warned about Vladimir Putin. I said I looked into his eyes and saw three letters, a K, a G and a B. He has surrounded himself with former KGB apparatchiks. He has gradually repressed most of the liberties that we would expect for nations to observe, and he has exhibited most aggressive behavior, obviously, in Georgia. I said before, watch Ukraine.

Now, the G-8 is one of those, but there are many others.

Obama,"Well, the resurgence of Russia is one of the central issues that were going to have to deal with in the next presidency. And for the most part I agree with Senator McCain on many of the steps that have to be taken. But we cant just provide moral support. Weve got to provide moral support to the Poles and Estonia and Latvia and all of the nations that were former Soviet satellites. But weve also got to provide them with financial and concrete assistance to help rebuild their economies. Georgia in particular is now on the brink of enormous economic challenges. And some say that thats what Putin intended in the first place. The other thing we have to do, though, is weve got to see around the corners. Weve got to anticipate some of these problems ahead of time. You know, back in April, I put out a statement saying that the situation in Georgia was unsustainable because you had Russian peacekeepers in these territories that were under dispute. And you knew that if the Russians themselves were trying to obtain some of these territories or push back against Georgia, that that was not a stable situation. So part of the job of the next commander-in-chief, in keeping all of you safe, is making sure that we can see some of the 21st Century challenges and anticipate them before they happen. We havent been doing enough of that. We tend to be reactive. Thats what weve been doing over the last eight years and that has actually made us more safe. Thats part of what happened in Afghanistan, where we rushed into Iraq and Senator McCain and President Bush suggested that it wasnt that important to catch bin Laden right now and that we could muddle through, and that has cost us dearly. Weve got to be much more strategic if were going to be able to deal with all of the challenges that we face out there. And one last point I want to make about Russia. Energy is going to be key in dealing with Russia. If we can reduce our energy consumption, that reduces the amount of petro dollars that they have to make mischief around the world.

I think the realities are that both Russia and China would probably pose significant obstacles. And our challenge right now is the Iranians continue on the path to acquiring nuclear weapons, and its a great threat. Its not just a threat  threat to the state of Israel. Its a threat to the stability of the entire Middle East. If Iran acquires nuclear weapons, all the other countries will acquire them, too. The tensions will be ratcheted up. Now, Senator Obama without precondition wants to sit down and negotiate with them, without preconditions. Thats what he stated, again, a matter of record. I want to make sure that the Iranians are put enough  that we put enough pressure on the Iranians by joining with our allies, imposing significant, tough sanctions to modify their behavior. And I think we can do that. I think, joining with our allies and friends in a league of democracies, that we can effectively abridge their behavior, and hopefully they would abandon this quest that they are on for nuclear weapons.

Obama,"Well, Terry, first of all, we honor your service, and were grateful for it. We cannot allow Iran to get a nuclear weapon. It would be a game-changer in the region. Not only would it threaten Israel, our strongest ally in the region and one of our strongest allies in the world, but it would also create a possibility of nuclear weapons falling into the hands of terrorists. And so its unacceptable. And I will do everything thats required to prevent it. And we will never take military options off the table. And it is important that we dont provide veto power to the United Nations or anyone else in acting in our interests. It is important, though, for us to use all the tools at our disposal to prevent the scenario where weve got to make those kinds of choices. And thats why I have consistently said that, if we can work more effectively with other countries diplomatically to tighten sanctions on Iran, if we can reduce our energy consumption through alternative energy, so that Iran has less money, if we can impose the kinds of sanctions that, say, for example, Iran right now imports gasoline, even though its an oil-producer, because its oil infrastructure has broken down, if we can prevent them from importing the gasoline that they need and the refined petroleum products, that starts changing their cost-benefit analysis. That starts putting the squeeze on them. Now, it is true, though, that I believe that we should have direct talks  not just with our friends, but also with our enemies  to deliver a tough, direct message to Iran that, if you dont change your behavior, then there will be dire consequences. If you do change your behavior, then it is possible for you to re-join the community of nations. Now, it may not work. But one of the things weve learned is, is that when we take that approach, whether its in North Korea or in Iran, then we have a better chance at better outcomes. When President Bush decided were not going to talk to Iran, were not going to talk to North Korea, you know what happened? Iran went from zero centrifuges to develop nuclear weapons to 4,000. North Korea quadrupled its nuclear capability. Weve got to try to have talks, understanding that were not taking military options off the table.",2008-10-07,Democrat
Brokaw,"All right, gentlemen, weve come to the last question. And youll both be interested to know this comes from the Internet and its from a state that youre strongly contesting, both of you. Its from Peggy (ph) in Amherst, New Hampshire. And it has a certain Zen-like quality, Ill give you a fair warning. Senator Obama, you get first crack at that.",2008-10-07,Moderator
Obama,"My wife, Michelle, is there and she could give you a much longer list than I do. And most of the time, I learn it by asking her. But, look, the nature of the challenges that were going to face are immense and one of the things that we know about the presidency is that its never the challenges that you expect. Its the challenges that you dont that end up consuming most of your time. But heres what I do know. I know that I wouldnt be standing here if it werent for the fact that this country gave me opportunity. I came from very modest means. I had a single mom and my grandparents raised me and it was because of the help of scholarships and my grandmother scrimping on things that she might have wanted to purchase and my mom, at one point, getting food stamps in order for us to put food on the table. Despite all that, I was able to go to the best schools on earth and I was able to succeed in a way that I could not have succeeded anywhere else in this country. The same is true for Michelle and Im sure the same is true for a lot of you. And the question in this election is: are we going to pass on that same American dream to the next generation? Over the last eight years, weve seen that dream diminish. Wages and incomes have gone down. People have lost their health care or are going bankrupt because they get sick. Weve got young people who have got the grades and the will and the drive to go to college, but they just dont have the money. And we cant expect that if we do the same things that weve been doing over the last eight years, that somehow we are going to have a different outcome. We need fundamental change. Thats whats at stake in this election. Thats the reason I decided to run for president, and Im hopeful that all of you are prepared to continue this extraordinary journey that we call America. But were going to have to have the courage and the sacrifice, the nerve to move in a new direction. Thank you. BROKAW: Senator McCain, you get the last word. Senator Obama had the opening. Youre last up.",2008-10-07,Democrat
Mccain,"Well, thank you, Tom. And I think what I dont know is what all of us dont know, and thats whats going to happen both here at home and abroad. The challenges that we face are unprecedented. Americans are hurting tonight in a way they have not in our generation. There are challenges around the world that are new and different and there will be different  we will be talking about countries sometime in the future that we hardly know where they are on the map, some Americans. So what I dont know is what the unexpected will be. But I have spent my whole life serving this country. I grew up in a family where my father was gone most of the time because he was at sea and doing our countrys business. My mother basically raised our family. I know what its like in dark times. I know what its like to have to fight to keep ones hope going through difficult times. I know what its like to rely on others for support and courage and love in tough times. I know what its like to have your comrades reach out to you and your neighbors and your fellow citizens and pick you up and put you back in the fight. Thats what Americas all about. I believe in this country. I believe in its future. I believe in its greatness. Its been my great honor to serve it for many, many years. And Im asking the American people to give me another opportunity and Ill rest on my record, but Ill also tell you, when times are tough, we need a steady hand at the tiller and the great honor of my life was to always put my country first.

Lehrer,"Good evening from the Mahaffey Theater at the Bayfront Center in St. Petersburg, Florida. Im Jim Lehrer of the News Hour on PBS. Welcome to the 1996 Vice Presidential Debate between Vice President Al Gore, the democratic nominee, and Jack Kemp, the republican nominee. This event is sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates. The rules and format, as drawn and agreed to by the two campaigns are almost identical to those of the presidential debate last Sunday night in Hartford. It is 90 minutes long. The candidates are not permitted to question each other directly. I will ask the questions with no limitations on the subjects. There will be a 90-second answer, a 60-second rebuttal, and a 30-second response to each question. And with the help of some lights, I will help the candidates abide by those time limits. The order for everything was determined by a coin toss. There will be three-minute closing statements, but no opening statements. So, we go now to the first question and to Mr. Kemp. Some supporters of Senator Dole have expressed disappointment over his unwillingness in Hartford Sunday night to draw personal and ethical differences between him and President Clinton. How do you feel about it?",1996-10-09,Moderator
Kemp,"Wow, in 90 seconds? I cant clear my throat in 90 seconds. Jim, Bob Dole and myself do not see Al Gore and Bill Clinton as our enemy. We see them as our opponents. This is the greatest democracy in the world. People are watching not only throughout this country, but all over the world as to how this democracy can function with civility and respect, and decency and integrity. Bob Dole, um, is one of those men who served in the United States Senate, his public life is a public record. He fought on the battlefield. He has worked with Democrats and Republicans. In my opinion, it is beneath Bob Dole to go after anyone personally. Clearly, Abraham Lincoln put it best when he said you serve your party best by serving the nation first. And I cant think of a better way of serving this nation in 1996 than by electing Bob Dole as the President of the United States of America. These issues are fully capable of being understood and reflected upon by the American people. This is a democracy in which we have the freest press and the greatest First Amendment rights in the history of mankind. And Bob and I respect that. These issues will be aired, but theyll be aired with dignity and respect, and, ultimately, leave it to the American people to make up their minds about who should be the leader of this country into the 21st Century.",1996-10-09,Republican

Gore,"Thank you, Mr. Lehrer. And I would like to thank the people of St. Petersburg for being such wonderful hosts. My family and I are very glad to be here and I would like to thank Jack Kemp for the answer that he just gave. I think we have an opportunity tonight to have a positive debate about this countrys future. Id like to start by offering you a deal, Jack. If you wont use any football stories, I wont tell any of my warm and humorous stories about chlorofluorocarbon abatement.",1996-10-09,Democrat
Kemp,Its a deal. I cant even pronounce it.,1996-10-09,Republican
Gore,"What I do want to talk about tonight is Bill Clintons positive plan for Americas future. We have a plan to balance the budget while protecting Medicare, Medicaid, education and the environment. Creating millions of new jobs, including one million new jobs in Americas inner cities. Im excited about the chance to talk about this plan and even more excited about the chance to work on it, if you, the people of this country, will give Bill Clinton and me the privilege of doing so for four more years.",1996-10-09,Democrat
Lehrer,Mr. Kemp?,1996-10-09,Moderator
Kemp,"I really got only two differences with Bill Clinton   President Clinton and Mr. Gore, foreign policy and domestic policy. Our foreign policy is ambivalent, confusing, it is sending strong signals to the wrong people, and we have learned over the years that weakness is provocative, but domestic economy is not doing what it can do. This President believes we are at our capacity. Bob Dole and I believe we can do a lot better. It is about the potential of the American people to lift themselves up and not have their lives controlled by the United States Government and Washington.",1996-10-09,Republican
Lehrer,"Mr. Vice President, what do you see as the political philosophy differences in a general way between you and President Clinton on the one hand, Mr. Kemp and Senator Dole on the other?",1996-10-09,Moderator
Gore,"The differences are very clear. We have a positive plan based on three principles. We want to provide opportunity for all Americans. We insist on responsibility being accepted in turn by everyone, and we want to strengthen our communities and their ability to support families and individuals in our common effort to create a bright future. Heres how we plan to do that: We have a balanced budget plan that has targeted tax cuts for middle-income families. Weve already given tax cuts to 15 million of the hardest pressed working families in America. Our plan for the next four years features a $1,500 tax credit, called a Hope Scholarship, for tuition at community college, junior college or college. A $10,000 tax deduction for college tuition for those who go further, so that, in essence, no American family will ever be taxed on the money they spend for college tuition. Also, tax relief for first-time home buyers, tax encouragement for savings and help in paying health care expenses, and a tax break, actually, the elimination of capital gains taxes on the  on the profits from the sale of a home. All of this is within a balanced budget plan, which protects Medicare, Medicaid, education and the environment.",1996-10-09,Democrat
Kemp,"Jim, this economy is overtaxed, overregulated, too many people suing each other, theres too much litigation. Our education is not up to the standards that the American family and the American people want for their children. And, clearly, the welfare system is a disgrace to our Judeo-Christian principles. It is not the values of the poor that should be called into question, it is the values of the welfare system from Washington and uh that prevent people from climbing out of poverty. Our biggest debate with this administration on domestic policy is that they think were at our fullest capacity, that weve reached our potential and 2.5 percent growth is enough for America. Frankly, that is not good enough for this country. We can not just run the clock out on the 20th Century. It, clearly, we need to lower the tax rate across the board on working and saving and investing. I know my friend, Al, will suggest that is trickle-down economics. Well, Al, if its trickle-down economics, ask Van Woods, a young entrepreneur who owns a restaurant in Harlem, if its trickle down. He said he would hire 60 more people if we cut the Capital Gains Tax.",1996-10-09,Republican
Gore,"I talked about our positive agenda for the future a moment ago. Your original answer was about the contrast. The plan from Senator Dole and Mr. Kemp is a risky, $550-billion tax scheme that actually raises taxes on 9 million of the hardest pressed working families. It would blow a hole in the deficit, cause much deeper cuts in Medicare, Medicaid, education and the environment and knock our economy off track, raising interest rates, mortgage rates and car payments. We stopped that plan before. We will stop it again. We want a positive plan for growth and more jobs.",1996-10-09,Democrat
Lehrer,"Mr. Kemp, back to the philosophy question. Do you think theres a basic philosophy difference between these two tickets, or is it about specifics, which both of you have talked about?",1996-10-09,Moderator
Kemp,"Well, this is a perfect example. Bob Dole and I want to cut the tax rates across the board on each and every American, working, saving, investing and taking risks in America. All wealth is created, and all growth is generated by risk-taking entrepreneurs. The tax rate on capital in America is way too high. Its too high on the family and its particularly too high on working men and women. The average family in America, at median level of income, probably is spending 25 to 26 percent of their income sent to the federal government. Thats more than shelter, food, clothing, and energy. Thats just not right. When I was growing up in Los Angeles, my parents were a one working family, one breadwinner per family was all that was necessary. Now if a woman wants to go to work or a man wants to go to work, it ought to be their choice, not the choice of the Washington, D.C. establishment. Bill Clinton, the President, and Al Gore, suggest that theyll give us a tax cut, but only if we do exactly what they want us to do. That isnt America. Thats social engineering. The tax code should reflect our values in a Judeo-Christian sense, that work, honesty and integrity and contracts and property and investment and savings should be rewarded, and Bob Dole and Jack Kemp are not only going to cut the tax rates across the board and lower the Capital Gain Tax. Ill be glad to talk about it a little later, because theres not enough time, but we are going to repeal the 83-year-old code and replace the seven and a half million words with a flatter, fairer, simpler code that will take this country roaring in the 21st Century.",1996-10-09,Republican
Gore,"This risky tax scheme would blow a hole in the deficit. You dont have to take my word for it. Time, Newsweek, U.S. News & World Report, Business Week, 83 percent of hundreds of economists in a random survey just recently all said it would blow a hole in the deficit. Theres another feature I would like to hear Mr. Kemp speak about. Just before he joined Senator Dole on the ticket, he said that the plan  the part of the plan that raises taxes on 9 million of the hardest working families in America was unconscionable, that means its wrong and it shouldnt happen. I agree, it is still part of the plan. We believe that taxes should not be increased on those families. We have a plan to cut taxes on middle income families within a balanced budget plan, eliminating the deficit and protecting Medicare, Medicaid, education and the environment.",1996-10-09,Democrat
Lehrer,Mr. Kemp?,1996-10-09,Moderator
Kemp,"Every time this country in the 20th Century has cut tax rates across the board, revenues went up, the economy grew, and I am surprised at this point in his career that Vice President Gore and the President cannot understand that you get more revenue from a bigger pie, and clearly, creating more jobs reduces the social welfare drain, clearly makes more opportunity for capital to be invested in our inner cities. And frankly, Al, we shouldnt just tinker with the Capital Gain Tax, we should eliminate it in the inner cities of America to put capital to work to make democratic capitalism and jobs available in our inner cities of the United States.",1996-10-09,Republican
Lehrer,"Mr. Vice President, should federal government Affirmative Action programs be continued?",1996-10-09,Moderator
Gore,"Yes. President Clinton addressed this issue when he said, Mend it, dont end it. Diversity is a great strength in America. Look around the world at other places where they have not paid attention to the necessity of promoting harmony of, between different ethnic, racial and religious, and cultural groups. We ought to be very proud in our country, as most Americans are, that weve made tremendous progress, but we ought to recognize that we have more work to do. Now, the first thing that we are trying to do is to create a million new jobs in the inner cities of this country, with tax credits for employers who hire people who are now unemployed. We are seeking to have vigorous enforcement of the laws that bar discrimination. Now, I want to congratulate Mr. Kemp for being a lonely voice in the Republican party over the years on this question. It is  it is with some sadness that I refer to the fact that the day after he joined Senator Doles ticket, he announced that he was changing his position and was hereto, thereafter going to adopt Senator Doles position to end all affirmative action. Thats not good for our country. Bill Clinton and I believe that the United States of America has its brightest days ahead, and we will see them even brighter if we promote diversity and harmony among all our people.",1996-10-09,Democrat
Lehrer,Mr. Kemp?,1996-10-09,Moderator
Kemp,"Jim, my position on Affirmative Action has been clear ever since I left the professional football career for Congress in 1970. Some people think I quit playing a few years earlier, but I retired in 1970. My life has been dedicated to equality of opportunity and our democracy should provide that, not equality of reward. Uh, Affirmative Action should be predicated upon need, not equality of reward, not equality of outcome. Quotas have always been against the American ideal. We should promote diversity and we should do it the way Bob Dole has been talking about, with a new civil rights agenda, based upon expanding access to credit and capital, job opportunities, educational choice in our inner cities for a young urban mother who cant get the type of an education she wants for her child, and, ultimately, the type of ownership and entrepreneurship from public housing in, D.C. to Nickerson Gardens in Watts, Los Angeles. People need to own. And thats what Abraham Lincoln believed. That when people own something, they have a stake in the American dream. That is Affirmative Action in America.",1996-10-09,Republican
Lehrer,Mr. Vice President.,1996-10-09,Moderator
Gore,"With all due respect, I do not believe that Abraham Lincoln would have adopted Bob Doles position to end all affirmative action. There is a specific measure on the ballot in California. It was embodied in legislation, introduced by Senator Dole, to apply to the whole nation. Mr. Kemp campaigned against it, spoke against it, wrote letters against it, went to California to fight against it, and now has endorsed it. I dont think its a minor matter. I think this is one of the most important challenges that our country has to face in the future, and I hope that Mr. Kemp will try to persuade Senator Dole to adopt Mr. Kemps position, instead of the other way around.",1996-10-09,Democrat
Lehrer,"Mr. Kemp, what is your position?",1996-10-09,Moderator
Kemp,That red light means were supposed to stop?,1996-10-09,Republican

Lehrer,"Mr. Kemp, do we have a serious race problem in the United States right now?",1996-10-09,Moderator
Kemp,"Yeah, we really do. Um, this country has yet to deal with the type of inclusionary policies. It is so very important for Americans, white and black, Jew and Christian, immigrant and native-born, to sit down and talk and listen and begin to understand what its like to come from that different perspective. Our country is as the Kerner Commission Report suggested a number of years ago was being split, but they said between white and black. I think its being split, Jim, not so much between white and black, although thats still a very serious problem. We really have two economies. Our general economy, our national economy, our mainstream economy is democratic, is based on incentives, a small d Al, its capitalism and incentives for working and saving and investing and producing, and families and the things that really lead to progress up that ladder that we call The American Dream, but is what is really universal. But unfortunately, in urban America, and I was glad to hear the Vice President talk a little bit about it, uh there  they have abandoned the inner cities. Theres a socialist economy. Theres no private housing. Theres mostly public housing. Youre told where to go to school, youre told what to buy with food stamps. It is a welfare system that is more like a third-world socialist country than what we would expect from the worlds greatest democratic free-enterprise system. That must change, and it will under Bob Dole and Jack Kemp.",1996-10-09,Republican
Gore,"Remember what I said just a moment ago. If it were not so, he would have told you. The problems between races in America must be addressed. The good news is were making progress. Weve seen 10.5 million new jobs created in the last four years. Weve seen the unemployment rate come down dramatically. Weve seen the African-American unemployment rate go below double digits for the first time in 25 years and it stayed below for 25 months in a row. We have empowerment zones and enterprise communities, 105 of them in communities all across the United States of America. Let me tell you a story about Joann Crowder in Detroit. She was on welfare for eight years until the empowerment zone was created there. She just got a job in the new business that  that launched its enterprise right in that empowerment zone. We want to do that for millions more all across the country.",1996-10-09,Democrat
Kemp,"Well, with all due respect, Jim, there are nine empowerment zones, a few little tinkering with tax credits around the country for inner cities. Los Angeles, after the riots, did not even get an empowerment zone, believe it or not. That is just unconscionable in America to have left Watts, South Central and East L.A. out. Earl Graves of Black Enterprise magazine said the single greatest deterrent to black advancement is the lack of access to capital, the credit and ownership. That will change. We will green-line every city in the United States where there is unemployment and welfare and we will eliminate the Capital Gains Tax, eliminate the tax on a welfare mother that takes a job. That is the answer. Give ownership and entrepreneurship to low income people based on need, not the color of their skin.",1996-10-09,Republican
Lehrer,"Mr. Vice President, if re-elected, what would, what could we look forward to in the way of an inner city policy from a Clinton/Gore second term?",1996-10-09,Moderator
Gore,"Before I answer that specific question, let me say that we did put an empowerment zone in South Central, Los Angeles. It is in the form of the largest community development financial institution ever created in the United States or in any other country and it is creating jobs in South Central, Los Angeles right now. The Congress passed uh an enterprise zone after the Los Angeles riots five years ago. It was vetoed by the prior administration. Now, to your question. We have a specific plan to create 1 million new jobs in the inner cities of America with tax credits for employers who hire people coming off welfare, cause weve passed welfare reform now, we promised to end welfare as we know it. And we are implementing this new legislation. We have moved 1.9 million people off of the welfare rolls and into good jobs in the last four years. Our new plan is to have 1 million more jobs in the inner cities, but thats not all. We are also implementing the plan to put 100,000 community police officers in our cities. Weve already got 20,000 out there. Were ahead of our six-year schedule. As a matter of fact, therere 8 here in St. Petersburg, already on the beat, you may run into one of them leaving this auditorium tonight. St. Petersburg is safer because of this urban agenda that were following. We want the focus to be on millions more jobs, and were very optimistic that its gonna happen.",1996-10-09,Democrat
Kemp,"Well, weve had four years and theres no enterprise zone. There are empowerment zones, but you have to do what Bill Clinton and Al Gore want you to do. You get a $5,000 tax credit if you hire somebody thats unemployed, but youve already got to have an existing business. The answer is to say, once again, green-line any area in America that has been red-lined for lack of mortgage money, lack of credit and capital. Just say that area qualifies for no Capital Gains Tax, zero, nada. Thats what Eleanor Holmes Norton wants to do in the District of Columbia and this administration said to D.C., Drop dead. Drop dead. We dont want to change the legislation that would lower the tax rate in D.C., allow welfare mothers to take a job without any tax on the first 90 percent of her income and no Capital Gain Tax that should be done in every urban area of America that would make capital flow back, and you cant have capitalism, Al, without capital. You may want to give a tax credit, but it wont work.",1996-10-09,Republican
Gore,"Well, we have 105 empowerment zones and enterprise communities all across the United States of America, and with all due respect, thats 105 more than were there when we came into the White House. We have been implementing them in a determined way. They are making a difference. You know, that empowerment zone that I mentioned in Detroit is creating jobs not only for Joann Crowder, who feels proud that shes off of welfare now, and were proud of her. Its creating jobs for hundreds of others, and similar initiatives are working in the other empowerment zones.",1996-10-09,Democrat
Lehrer,"Mr. Kemp, you said recently that one of the problems related to this was that all the capital was in the hands of the white people. What did you mean by that?",1996-10-09,Moderator
Kemp,"The single greatest problem in our opinion, domestic  in the domestic economy, is that this tax code, 83 years old, a relic of the Cold War and Hot War, inflation and depression, seven-and-a-half million words long, overtaxes capital, overtaxes working men and women and families. Clearly, the Gordian knot needs to be broken in one fell swoop. Bob Dole and Jack Kemp, as soon as we get through this first step of cutting tax rates across the board, are going to repeal the whole code while Bill Clinton and my friend, Al Gore, defend the status quo. Were going to repeal the seven-and-a-half million words of the U.S.tax code, make it tax income once, not twice, three, four, and if you die, it confiscates your estate. We must have a tax code going into the 21st Century that does not protect the establishment and this tax code does. And by cutting and eliminating the Capital Gains, by cutting and eliminating the Estate Tax, by bringing the top tax rate down to something reasonable, like  here he goes again  I think in peacetime, it shouldnt be higher, Bob, and I dont think it should be higher than 25 percent, phased in. But capital would flow out into the economy. We have people getting access to capital. Small businessmen and women, African-American, Asian Americans, Latino Americans, female Americans would be able to start their businesses. Dana Crist of Lancaster said the day the tax bill is passed in Congress, she will open a new factory with 40 or 50 or 60 employees in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. Hell call that trickle down. Ill call it Niagara Falls.",1996-10-09,Republican
Gore,"The problem with this version of Niagara Falls is that Senator Dole and Mr. Kemp would put the economy in a barrel and send it over the falls. [ Laughter ] It is a risky, $550-billion tax scheme that actually raises taxes on 9 million of the hardest working families. Again, Mr. Kemp opposed that and called it unconscionable. Now, it is part of the plan that he is supporting. Not only that, though, it would blow a hole in the deficit, it would raise interest rates. That means higher mortgage payments, particularly those with the variable rate mortgages, higher car payments, he would also lead to much deeper cuts in Medicare, Medicaid, education and the environment. It is extremely risky. And as for these harsh words, I dont take them personally. He said much worse about Bob Dole when he said Bob Dole never met a tax that he didnt hike. He wrote about 450 separate provisions in that code. You better check with him before you eliminate it completely. He may be getting royalties.",1996-10-09,Democrat
Kemp,"Jim, a $550-billion tax cut, this is something that Al does not want to mention, has to be viewed against the context of a $50-trillion U.S. economy output of goods and services over the next six years. A $550-billion tax cut in a $50-trillion economy over six years is one-and-a-half percent, and the only hole it would blow is a hole in the plans of this administration to try to tinker with the tax code and defend the indefensible. It would blow up the bureaucracy, but you would expand the economy. Thats important for America.",1996-10-09,Republican
Lehrer,"Mr. Vice President, what about Mr. Kemps point that hes made a couple of times that what we need is to throw away the current  the present tax code and write a whole new tax system. Do you agree with that?",1996-10-09,Moderator
Gore,"Weve passed the Taxpayer Bill of Rights. We have fought for new provisions that now make it possible to file over the telephone. We are fighting for tax reforms across-the-board, and most importantly, we have a plan on the table right now to cut taxes on middle income families with several specific provisions. We already cut taxes on 15 million working families in this county, with an average of about $1,000 in tax relief to those making $25,000 a year or less. And for the last two years, we have had middle-income tax cuts on the table in the Congress and they would not  they werent accepted by Bob Dole and Newt Gingrich, because they said they would not pass them without cutting deeply into Medicare, Medicaid, education and the environment. We are determined to move forward during these next four years, with the tax cuts that president Bill Clinton has proposed. Here they are again: A $1500 tax credit for tuition, a $10,000 tax deduction so that no family pays taxes on the money for college tuition, capital gains eliminated for the sale of a home, a tax break for first-time home buyers and for health care expenses and a $500 child tax credit.",1996-10-09,Democrat
Kemp,"You only get a tax cut in the Clinton administration if you do exactly what Al Gore and Bill Clinton want you to do. Thats not America. When John F. Kennedy cut tax rates, the economy grew, unemployment went down and we balanced the budget, and revenues went up. Indeed, the Secretary of Treasury under John F. Kennedy and the Deputy Secretary of Treasury under John F. Kennedy endorsed Bob Doles plan to cut rates, cut the Capital Gains Tax, balance the budget, provide a $500 tax credit, and, clearly, the plan should be to lift the economy, to get more revenues. Medicare will be saved because it will be put into a commission where both Bill Clinton and Bob Dole recognize it has to be studied by the same people that would study  or did study, I should say, the Social Security System and saved it in 1983 and 84. Look, we can bring down government  the growth of government spending, but we have to grow the economy. And in Bob Dole and Jack Kemps opinion, we should aim at doubling the size of the American economy in the next 15 years. Under their policies, it will take 30 to 40 years. Thats not acceptable.",1996-10-09,Republican
Gore,"The chairman of their national campaign steering committee, Senator DAmato, said that Bob Dole would have to cut into Medicare in order to pay for this proposal, but that he would wait until after the election to do it. The proposal to cut Medicare that Senator Dole pushed before, and shut down the government to try to enact, would have already raised by $268, the fees paid by the average couple now on Medicare. He tried to double the deductibles and give people less in return. We have a balanced budget plan that protects Medicare and gives tax cuts.",1996-10-09,Democrat

The amount of money being spent to try to mislead the American people is demagoguery, and only in the Clinton White House and in Al Gores mind could an increase in spending per capita on a senior citizen from $4800 in 1996 to $7200 over the next five years be considered a cut. Does anybody think that Bob Dole, who almost gave his life for his country, who has served in the Senate, who helped save Social Security, crawled out of a fox hole on Riva Ridge in Northern Italy in 1945 to save a wounded radioman? Does anybody think in this country that he could possibly want to move our country ahead and leave anybody behind? Of course, we can balance the budget. Of course, we have to hold down the growth in entitlement spending. But clearly, you cannot balance the budget, Jim, without growing this economy. Its only growing at about two-and-a-half percent. We should double the rate of growth and double the size of American economy. This means more jobs, more wealth, more income and more capital, particularly for our nations poor and those left behind.",1996-10-09,Republican

A commission is fine, but a commission would not do any good if we adopted this risky $550-billion tax scheme. The word scary has been used. A couple of days ago I went with Governor Lawton Chiles, who was here, to Sarasota to the Friendship Senior Center. I talked with a woman there named Dorothy Wornell and she said, You know, we may not be as sophisticated as some of those people in Washington, but we can add and subtract. Here are the numbers shes adding and subtracting. Bob Doles plan would have already imposed an extra $268 on the average Medicare receiving couple, and his plan would have doubled deductibles. It would have cost an extra $1,700 over the lifetime of his plan and eliminated nursing home standards and guarantees of nursing home care for seniors. Bill Clinton prevented it from happening. We will never allow that to happen.",1996-10-09,Democrat

By the Presidents own trustees of Medicare, three members of which serve in his cabinet, it will be losing $23 billion a year by 1998. Something must be done. Bob Dole is  has suggested a commission, but, clearly, you cannot save Medicare, Social Security, or any program for the social welfare net of American people, under which they should not be allowed to fall, unless we grow this economy at least twice the rate it is growing today.

He said just two years ago that the Bob Dole tax increase of 1982 was the largest tax increase in the history of the world, but lets get to the point. Medicare has been adjusted 23 times since it was created in 1965. Bob Dole, incidentally, just bragged this year that he was one of only 12 people who voted against the creation of Medicare in the first place. I dont think hes  he didnt believe in it then, and the plan that he promoted last year would have certainly been devastating to Medicare. Again, dont take my word for it. The American Hospital Association said it could have closed 700 hospitals. The Catholic Health Association, the AARP, and many other groups who pay careful attention to Medicare said that the Dole/Gingrich plan on Medicare would have led to deep cuts, possibly set up a two-tiered system, and would have ended the kind of Medicare system that we have. Our plan extends Medicare ten years into the future. We will always protect Medicare within the context of a balanced budget plan.",1996-10-09,Democrat

The President himself suggested that the reduction in the growth of Medicare over the next five or six years ought to be held to 6 percent under the Republican plan, irrespective of the numbers, it will grow at 7 or even more percent, but that is beside the point. What has to be discussed is how we, as a nation, are going to create the size of an economy, create a national wealth that would at least double this 6 or 7 trillion economy. We would have $6 trillion in 15 years extra wealth for the American people. Another trillion dollars of revenue, with which to save Medicare and Social Security. And you cant do it with a tax code and a regulatory code and people suing each other with frivolous suits, as this administration is allowing to happen. That has to change, and it will under Bob Dole and Jack Kemp.",1996-10-09,Republican

Putting that aside, the  we recognize theres no consensus in America. This country is split between those who call themselves pro-choice, and Im sure, very sincerely, and those of us who call ourselves pro-life, this is a very emotional issue. Im sure it is for a woman. It certainly is for those of us like my wife and myself who have three adopted grandchildren. We thank God every night of our life that a young woman was given a choice, was given the opportunity to choose life. This country should not be torn asunder over this debate, it has to be carried out with civility and respect, and Bob and I believe it can be. But we should recognize that every human life is precious and there should be all of the protection that we can give for an unborn human being. And to think that in this country, for every three births, there is one abortion. But even worse than that, as ugly as that might be  and I know its a tragedy to many people both on the pro-choice and pro-life position  we have a President who vetoed a congressional ban on the ugly and gruesome practice of snatching life away from a child just moments before he or she enters the world.

What is really at stake here is whether or not women will have the right to choose. The platform on which Mr. Kemp and Senator Dole are running pledges a constitutional amendment to take away a womans right to choose and to have the government come in and order that woman to do what the government says, no matter what the circumstances.

We hope that it will stay over with. Elections having just been held. There is great progress towards peace and reconciliation in Bosnia. We ought to be very proud of our soldiers who have played such a critical role in bringing about this peace in Bosnia. Its not the only case where Bill Clinton has provided such leadership. We have restored democracy to Haiti, with scarcely a shot being fired. We have seen movement towards reconciliation in Northern Ireland and in the Middle East. The Bible says there will always be wars and rumors of wars. As the President said the other night, there will always be troubles in this ol world, but the United States of America can be counted on to provide the vision that the world looks for from the United States of America.

To think that Sam Nunn of Georgia or Colin Powell helped put together the coalition in the Persian Gulf were not even consulted. It was not only precipitous, it was a sign, not of strength, but of weakness. Whats worse, they declared victory. Theyve declared victory in every deployment. Weve had more deployments in four years than any previous four years I can think of, and Im 61 years of age. Its unbelievable that ambiguity can be called foreign policy.

Clearly, uh it was maybe the right thing to do, but we did not go in with enough information. We caused problems in the first place by denying Caribbean countries and third-world countries a chance to trade freely in the United States. It causes economic problems and turmoil, and then we turn around, as we did in Mexico, having to bail them out. We caused the problem in the first place, and it cost us 20 to 50 billion to bail them out. Haiti is very ambiguous at best. We pray that democracy comes to Haiti, but so far, the message from Haiti is quite ambiguous, notwithstanding the declaration of victory by this administration.",1996-10-09,Republican

The planes were in the air and our negotiators were talking with the dictator down there. And when that dictator got the news from his spies outside the gate that all these planes were taking off, he said, lets get out of here. Thats how it was done. It was one of the most deft uses of diplomacy and military force in combination that you will find anywhere in the annals of the history of this country.

That used to be an integral part of this so-called Supply Side Economics, but it may be something else that he now agrees with Bob Dole on, because Bob Dole voted to take us off the gold standard, a wise vote in my opinion. Most  all economists say that if we did that, it would throw us into a deep recession or depression and put millions out of work, but let me come directly to this question. No, when there was a crisis involving the Mexican peso, again, President Bill Clinton showed bold and dynamic leadership. I want to hasten to add that Senator Bob Dole gave critical bipartisan support at the time. He agreed with the President. He supported the President. He said this is a wise move. He could not get a majority in the Senate, and Speaker Gingrich could not get a majority in the house to go on record in support of it. So, the President, as presidents often have to do, went alone and did the right thing. You know, people said it was a big risk at that time. Weve ended up making a $500 million profit.

Thats dangerous and its provocative. And the mixed message, the ambiguities of U.S. foreign policy, uh are  I believe, and Bob Dole believes, is causing not only problems for this country throughout the world, but particularly here at home. And the type of changes that were made overnight in California caused very severe dislocations. And then, of course, the President ran out to California and announced, well, maybe well have another B-1or B-2 Bomber. But that is not the way policy should be made.

Theyre very, very similar. There is a huge difference in our economic plan. This risky $550-billion tax scheme that I talked about earlier is said by the Concord Coalition, including Republicans like Pete Peterson and Warren Rudman, to pose a threat to our nations ability to have a sensible defense budget in the future. Theyve gone on record as saying that this tax scheme would not only raise taxes on 9 million hard-working American families, but would also lead, almost inevitably, to deep cuts in Medicare and in defense.

Now, if the purpose of the tax code is to raise revenue. We ought to think, as John F. Kennedy did, about lowering the rates. We cant go to zero. They cant go too low, because theres not enough revenue, but President Clinton apologized in Houston for saying, whoops, I raised your taxes and theyre too high.

He was one of those who voted against John F. Kennedys tax cut. The environment faces dire threats from the kind of legislation that Senator Dole and Speaker Newt Gingrich tried to pass by shutting down the government and attempting to force President Clinton to accept it. They invited the lobbyists for the biggest polluters in America to come into the Congress and literally rewrite the Clean Water Act and the Clean Air Act. President Clinton stopped them dead in their tracks. We have a positive agenda on the environment because we believe very deeply that its about our children and our future. Clean air and clean water, cleaning up toxic waste sites, when millions of children live within one mile of them. Thats important. We have a plan to clean up two-thirds of the toxic waste sites in America over the next four years. Weve already cleaned up more in the last three years than the previous two administrations did in 12. The President just set aside the Utah National Monument. He is protecting the Everglades here in Florida. Bob Dole is opposed to that plan. President Bill Clinton will protect our environment and prevent the kind of attacks on it that we saw in the last Congress and are included in the Republican platform.",1996-10-09,Democrat

Fear of the environment, fear of the climate, fear of Medicare, fear of Newt, fear of Republicans, fear of Bob, and probably fear of cutting tax rates. They aint seen nothing yet. Look, we recognize that this country has to live in balance with our environment. Every one of us who have children and grandchildren recognize how we have to reach a balance. It is not jobs versus our environment. Both are important. This is the most overregulated, overly litigated economy in our nations history. And to call a businessman or woman who sits down and has a chance to express his or her interest in how to make these laws work and call them a polluter is just outrageous. It is typical of the anti-capitalistic mentality of this administration. That will change, because we believe in democratic capitalism for everybody.",1996-10-09,Republican

Kemp,"Well, exactly just what I said. Regulations that take property or reduce the value of some farmer or rancher or homeowners property for wetlands or endangered species and take that property or reduce its value without compensating the owner. That is a reign of terror. Its happening. In Oregon, not too long ago, a farmer took 25 percent of his property and declared it a wetland. It had the runoff of snow that allowed it to be declared a wetland, but he did it himself voluntarily. He found within a couple of years that the Bald Eagle began to use it as a habitat. The Corporations of Engineers, the Bureau of Wildlife and Fisheries, all of the federal agencies came onto his property, declared it a federal wetland and said he couldnt drive. They took away the road, he couldnt mend his fences and they wouldnt pay the value of the loss of the  they wouldnt pay  or compensate, I should say, for the loss of value to that property. How can we, as a free society, turn people into enemies or adversaries of the United States government? OSHA does it, EPA does it, ERDA does it. And you name it. We should recognize that this country lives in such a way as to build an alliance with our free enterprise system that can build a better America for our children and our grandchildren. We can do it. But its got to take new leadership in Washington.",1996-10-09,Republican

We have been taking a new approach, protecting the environment, but getting rid of unnecessary regulations. Were eliminating 16,000 pages of regulations. Weve entered a  into a new project called project XL. This is at the EPA. Where we enter into a bargain with businesses. When they say well exceed the standards, we give the EPA a way to measure the progress and throw away the rulebook all together. Now this is the kind of common sense approach that can clean up the environment while eliminating unnecessary red tape. Make no mistake about it, though, there are those who would like to go much further. Some have even proposed and this bill he cites would do it, that polluters ought to be paid if they agree to stop dumping poisons into the river. The pay polluters provision is wrong.

We said change that rule. Its being changed now. Its under consideration by the FDA right now and it will be changed. There are thousands of other examples. We believe that there is a new approach. Let me give you an example from OSHA. Were reinventing the way OSHA does its job. Some people would like to eliminate OSHA. We think that the protection of job safety in the workplace is very, very important, but what weve said is look, start, start measuring the results. We found that the inspectors were being rewarded on the basis of how many fines they issued. We changed that completely. They used to go in and give somebody a fine if they didnt have a poster on the wall informing employees of their rights. To use this as an example of our new approach, now if they go in and see that poster is not there, they go out to the trunk of the car and give them a poster.

As long as a woman or man wants to go to work it ought to be their choice, but in America today that woman or man must work in a family to, one to pay the tax and the other to help the family. Thats not America. It doesnt leave enough time for the children. It doesnt leave enough time for people to enjoy their families. It doesnt allow people to save. The family is the most overtaxed institution in the United States of America. When I was growing up in Los Angeles, a family that median level of income might have sent four or five percent of their income to the federal government. Today, its close to 30, or at least 27 or 28%. Thats just unacceptable, and for Al Gore to keep suggesting that we cant afford to reduce the tax rates across-the-board on the American people and on the formation of the capital necessary to create the new jobs for America is just totally at odds with the experience of both Ronald Reagan, John F. Kennedy and other times in this century. One other thing thats very, very important. To call it a risky scheme reminds me of the fact that this administration is suggesting that theyre going to give you a tax cut if youll do what they want you to do. They want to cut the Capital Gain Tax, but only for home owners. How about the small businessmen and women of America that create 91% of all the new jobs?

How can we trust an administration that, all of a sudden, four years into or the last year of its four years tells us that now theyre going to follow through on the promise they made four years ago? This economy is not growing fast enough. The haves are doing well, but Jim the have-nots are not doing well. Theres people hurting, therere families that cant stay together.

He promised to end welfare as we know it. He passed and signed the Welfare Reform Law. He has already moved 1.9 million people off the welfare rolls into good jobs. Weve got a plan to move 1 million more off welfare during the next four years. He promised to implement the death penalty. We passed an anti-crime Bill that has 60 new death penalty provisions. He promised to pass a plan that would put 100,000 new police officers on the streets. It is law, over the opposition of Senator Dole, and 20,000 of them are already on the streets, 2,000 of them have been funded already for here in Florida. Were ahead of schedule and were going to get the additional 80,000 new police officers on the streets in the coming four years, 45,000 of them are now already funded. That is a record of promises made and promises kept. He promised middle-income tax cuts.

In the next four years, we will pass it.",1996-10-09,Democrat

But irrespective of whether he thinks it is or not means less than fact that this country cannot morally and socially and economically accept an economy running out the clock on the 20th Century. Were treading water. We have families that are hurting. We have people who are unemployed. We have people with no property. We have an administration that is demolishing public housing in our inner cities and not providing anything else but more public housing. Their solution to the inner city is more  excuse the expression but its true, socialism. It is not for the people. It is for the government to tell them where to live, where to go to school. We need school choice.

How in the name of American democracy can we say to eastern Europe that democratic capitalism will work there if we cant make it work in East L.A. or East Harlem or East Palo Alto, California? How can we tell South Africa and the new Mandela government that democracy and private property and limited government and the rule of law and civility will work there if its not working in our own backyard here at home or the South Bronx? How can America go into the next century and leave so many people behind? USA Today, just few weeks ago did a study. They said the affluent are doing very well in America, the haves, the have-nots and the poor are being left behind. It is a giant, in my opinion, zero sum game. Kind of like musical chairs when we were young boys and girls growing up. And it seemed like when the music stopped the big guy elbowed out the little guy from that last chair. Thats not America folks. We need more chairs, we need a bigger table, we need a greater banquet. We need to create more wealth.

I think its an extremely valuable service to have a voice within the Republican party who says we ought to be one nation. We ought to cross all of the racial and ethnic and cultural barriers. I think that is a very important message to deliver. And we ought to speak out against these violations of civility when they do occur. You asked about the incident involving Roberto Alomar. I wont hesitate to tell you what I think. I think he should have been severely disciplined, suspended perhaps, immediately. I dont understand why that action was not taken, but the same could be said of so many incidents in all kinds of institutions in our society, but I compliment Mr. Kemp for the leadership he has shown in moving us away from that kind of attitude.",1996-10-09,Democrat

That civility cannot return to our country unless every person feels that they have an equal shot at the American dream. That if youre born in this country to be a mezzo-soprano or a master carpenter or a school teacher, like my daughter, or a professional football quarterback, nothing should be in your way. And removing those barriers is what Bob Dole is all about, moving our country forward and leaving no one behind.",1996-10-09,Republican

Gore,"I think that economics is one of the single most important parts of this problem. Thats why were focusing on tax credits, to hire 1 million more people coming off welfare in the inner city. Thats why were focusing on an economic policy that has already created ten and a half million new jobs and is going to create millions more within the context, again, of a balanced budget that protects important programs. We have focused especially on the most distressed areas, because we cannot leave anyone behind. Our empowerment zones and enterprise communities, the tax credits that will encourage the formation of new businesses, the new approach by the small business administration to get more loans out to individuals that have not had equal access to capital in the past. These are parts of the plan. Another part of it is the community development financial institutions. And the  and the law that says deposits that are made in a community, in the inner cities say, should be kept in the community, not entirely, but some percentage of them should be kept there. That prevents that money being taken from the community and invested in some go-go investment on the other side of the world. And when they invest in the community, they find that theres a better payback rate, more small businesses are created and the community improves. Thats happening in America today, not fast enough, but faster than before and we think we can accelerate it with our plan.",1996-10-09,Democrat
Kemp,"There really is no separation between a strong community and a strong economy. And you cant have a strong economy without strong communities and strong families. The word economics in Greek came from the word family, or law or custom of the family. A family without a job where both breadwinners are away from home and cannot spend time with their children or cant send the child to the school of their choice rather than just the choice of the federal bureaucracy, cannot possibly be as strong as a family that has the nurture, the love, the dignity and the justice that goes along with one breadwinner, a strong job, and if that man or woman wants to work, its their choice, not just to pay taxes. So we need both. We need strong commun  we need strong schools, we need schools that nurture the type of discipline and respect from teachers and parents. And Bob Dole wants to empower the public school districts and the teachers, not the federal bureaucracy at the Department of Education.",1996-10-09,Republican

He vigorously opposed the Family and Medical Leave Act, which was the first law that President Clinton signed as president.

If there arent a lot of jobs, if there isnt the types of policies that will enhance the formation of the seed corn and the oxygen and the capital that would allow that company not only retain that profit but invest it. As I said earlier, Dana Crist of Lancaster, Pennsylvania who runs a small little manufacturing or distribution center in Lancaster, said that she as an entrepreneur, would start a whole new factory if the federal government would cut the cost of capital. She wants the capital gains rate reduced. And if, to Al Gore and Bill Clinton that is somehow, trickle-down economics. Tell that to Dana Crist, tell it to Van Woods, tell it to the men and women I met in South Central. Tell it to anybody who understands how to makes democratic capitalism work. I want to say it one more time. The real excitement of a Dole/Kemp Administration would be to get out of this current tax code that redistributes wealth and create a brand new system for the 21st Century thats pro-family, pro-growth and stops the double, triple and quadruple taxation of income from work, savings, investment and entrepreneurial risk taking in America.",1996-10-09,Republican

If you have a child who is critically ill or has been seriously injured and you have to stay with that child in the hospital, some employers, have said you cant take too much time off in spite of these circumstances. I personally know people who have been fired because they made the choice to be with their child. Dont tell me this doesnt happen. It happens all across the United States. But since Bill Clinton made this the first law he signed, it has been use 12 million times by American families to reconcile the demands of work with the responsibilities to the family.

I think this is the most exciting time in the history of the world to be alive. We have lived through what Jean Kirpatrick called the bloodiest century in mankinds history. We have defeated in this system of ours fascism, Nazism, communism, socialism is defunct or debunked around the world, the evil of apartheid has ended. There is only one last question remaining for the next century, indeed the next millennium. Can we, in America, make the worlds greatest liberal democracy, this democratic experiment in private property, limited government, the rule of law, respect for families and traditional Judeo-Christian values work, so it can be a blessing to our country and a blessing to the rest of the world? With all due respect to this administration, theyve got a foreign policy in disarray. They have a lack of credibility around the world. Weakness, I said earlier, is provocative and clearly, this economy is not performing up to the standards that we would expect from this great nation going into the most exciting global economy the world has ever known. Theres something amiss. Our culture seems to be weakening all around us. Families are under tremendous pressure. People do not  do not feel safe in their homes. A mother doesnt feel safe sending her child to school. Our schools are not educating. Its not the problem of the teachers. They are overworked and my daughter will tell you, they are underpaid and we know that, they need to be empowered. We need to reform education. We need to reform welfare. We need to reform litigation and regulation. And we certainly need to reform this tax code that is a product of this terrible century of war and recession and inflations. It can be done. We need somebody who understands the potential of the American people, who are not just doing well for ourselves, we need to do well for the rest of the world, because theyre looking at us. And we need to make it work in every neighborhood and community in America and for every family, so that no one as Bob Dole said in his San Diego acceptance speech is left behind. Bob Dole, as I said earlier, is a man of courage, a man of principles, a man who crawled out of a fox hole on Riva Ridge in 1945 to save a wounded brethren. The bible says no greater love hath a man than he gave his life. Well, Bob Dole did, just about, hed been through the valley of the shadow and he as Commander-in-Chief can take this country with the courage of Churchill.

Gore,"Thank you very much, Mr. Lehrer. Thanks again to the people of St. Petersburg and thanks again to Jack Kemp. I have enormous respect for Jack Kemp and for Bob Dole. Theyre good men. I dont agree with their plan. Ive tried to make that clear tonight. And one reason Ive tried to make it clear is that in just 27 days, the United States of America has an important choice to make. Between two approaches to the future of this country. We have a plan that will create millions more jobs, bring the deficits down further and balance the budget, while protecting Medicare, protecting Medicaid, protecting and preserving the environment, our air, our water, the Everglades, the Tongas, the Mojave Desert in California, the Utah-Red Rocks area, all of which have been protected by President Bill Clinton. We also have a plan to expand access to education. Theres a family in the audience tonight, the McNeil family, who lives right here in St. Petersburg. Both parents are teachers, theyre not rich in money, but they have strong values and they value education. Theyre oldest son is a freshman at St. Petersburg Junior High  Junior College. Their younger son, Roderick, is a sophomore in the same high school that Don McNeil teaches at. Roderick is concerned that he may not be able to get the tuition he needs to go to college when the time comes. Our plan gives a $1500 tax credit to make that junior college essentially free. And a $10,000 tax deduction to make it so that no American family, or almost no family, will have to pay taxes on the money they pay for college tuition. This plan also gives tax breaks on the sale of a home, up to $500,000 in profit tax free. It gives the new break for first-time home buyers, and, again, all in the context of a balanced budget. We have seen progress during the last four years because policies like these have been working. This risky scheme that Ive described tonight has been said by many objective observers to not add up, it would be a serious risk. Our plan, by contrast, has been working and will work more. We want to build a bridge to the 21st Century and we want it to be strong enough and broad enough for all families to cross and we want it to lead to a brighter future for America, cause our best days are ahead.",1996-10-09,Democrat

Moyers,your time is up. Ms. Loomis?,1980-09-21,Moderator
Loomis,"Governor Reagan, repeating the question, and I would ask you, again, to engage in as many specifics as you possibly can. What politically unpopular measures are you willing to endorse, push and stay with that might provide real progress in reducing inflation? GOV. RONALD REAGAN: I believe that the only unpopular measures, actually, that could be, or would be applied, would be unpopular with the government, and with those. perhaps, some special interest groups who are tied closely to government. I believe that inflation today is caused by government simply spending more than government takes in, at the same time that government has imposed upon business and industry, from the shopkeeper on the corner to the biggest industrial plant in America, countless harassing regulations and punitive taxes that have reduced productivity at the same time they have increased the cost of production. And when you are reducing productivity at the same time that you are turning out printing-press money in excessive amounts, youre causing inflation. And it isnt really higher prices, its just, you are reducing the value of the money. You are robbing the American people of their savings. And so, the plan that I have proposed  and contrary to what John says, my plan is for a phased-in tax cut over a three-year period, tax increase and depreciation allowances for business and industry to give them the capital to refurbish plant and equipment, research and development, improved technology  all of which we see our foreign competitors having, and we have the greatest percentage of outmoded industrial plant and equipment of any of the industrial nations  produce more, have stable money supply, and give the people of this country a greater share of their own savings. Now, I know that this has been called inflationary by my opponent and by the man who isnt here tonight. But I dont see where it is inflationary to have people keep more of their earnings and spend it, and it isnt inflationary for government to take that money away from them and spend it on the things it wants to spend it on. I believe we need incentive for the individual, and for business and industry, and I believe the plan that I have submitted, with detailed backing, and which has been approved by a number of our leading economists in the country, is based on projections. conservative projections out for the next five years, that indicates that this plan would, by 1983, result in a balanced budget. We have to remember, when we talk a tax cut, were only talking about reducing a tax increase, because this Administration has left us with a built-in tax increase that will amount to $86 billion next year.",1980-09-21,Moderator

Anderson,"Mr. Movers, in addition to saying that this is no time for a tax cut, in view of the incipient signs of renewed inflation, in addition to calling for restraint in Federal spending, 15 months ago, I also suggested we ought to have an emergency excise tax on gasoline. I say that because I think, this year, we will send $90 billion out of this country to pay for imported oil, even though that. those imports have been reduced. And since I first made that proposal 15 months ago, the price of gasoline, which was then $.80, has gone up to about $1.30. In other words, weve had a huge increase of about $.50 a gallon since that time, and all of that increase has gone out of this country  or much of it  into the pockets of OPEC oil producers. Whereas I have proposed we ought to take. put that tax on here at home, reduce our consumption of that imported oil. Recycle those proceeds, then, back into the pockets of the American workers by reducing their tax payments. their Social Security tax payments by 50%. That, I think, in addition, would be an anti-inflationary measure that would strengthen the economy of this country.",1980-09-21,Independent

It would still have gone up as much as it has, and the $.50 would be added on top of that. And it would be a tax paid by the consumers, and then were asked to believe that some way, they would get this back to the consumers. But why? Why take it in the first place if youre going to give it back? Why not leave it with them? And John spoke about 15 years ago, on the position that he. or 15 months ago, on what he believed in. Fifteen months ago, he was a cosigner and advocating the very tax cut that I am proposing, and said that that would be a forward step in fighting inflation, and that it would be beneficial to the working people of this country.",1980-09-21,Republican
Moyers,The next question goes to Mr. Reagan from Daniel Greenberg.,1980-09-21,Moderator
Reagan,"Well, I believe that conservation, at course, is worthy in and of itself. Anything that would preserve, or help us use less energy, that would be fine, and Im for it. But I do not believe that conservation alone is the answer to the present energy problem, because all youre doing then is staving off, by a short time, the day when you would come to the end of the energy supply. To say that we are limited, and at a dangerous point in this country with regard to energy, I think, is to ignore the fact. The fact is, that in todays oil wells, there is more oil still there than we have so far taken out and used. But it would require what is known as secondary or tertiary efforts to bring it out of the ground. And this is known oil reserves, known supplies. There are hundreds of millions of acres of land that have been taken out of circulation by the Government for whatever reason they have, that is believed by the most knowledgeable oil geologists to contain probably more oil and natural gas than we have used so far since we drilled that first well 121 years ago. We have a coal supply that is equal to 50% of the worlds coal supply, good for centuries, in this country. I grant you that prices may go up, because as you go further and have to go deeper, you are adding to the cost of production. We have nuclear power, which, I believe, with the safest. the most stringent of safety requirements, could meet our energy needs for the next couple of decades while we go forward exploring the areas of solar power and other forms of energy that might be renewable and that would not be exhaustible. All of these things can be done. When you stop and think that we are only drilling on 2%. have leased only 2% of the possible. possibility for oil of the continental shelf around the United States; when you stop to think that the government has taken over 100 million acres of land out of circulation in Alaska, alone, that is believed by geologists to contain much in the line of minerals and energy sources, then I think it is the Government, and the Government with its own restrictions and regulations, that is creating the energy crisis. That we are, indeed, an energy-rich nation.",1980-09-21,Republican
Moyers,"I would like to say at this point that the candidates requested the same questions to be repeated, for the sake of precision, on the part of the interrogator. So, Mr. Greenberg, you may address Mr. Anderson.",1980-09-21,Moderator
Greenberg,"Mr. Anderson, Id like to know specifically, what changes you would encourage and require in American lifestyles in automobile use, housing, land use and consumption, to meet problems that arent going to respond to campaign lullabies about minor conservation efforts and more production?",1980-09-21,Moderator
Anderson,"Well, Mr. Greenberg, I simply cannot allow to go unpassed the statements that have just been made by Mr. Reagan, who once again, has demonstrated, I think, a total misunderstanding of the energy crisis that confronts, not only this country, but the world, when he suggests that we have 27 years supply of natural gas, 47 years supply of oil, and all the rest, and that we really. all we have to do is to get the Government off the back of the oil industry, and thats going to be enough. I agree with what I think is the major premise of your question, sir, that we are going to have to create a new conservation ethic in the minds of the American people. and thats simply why I proposed, 15 months ago, the emergency excise tax on gasoline that I did. I did it as a security measure to be sure, because I would rather see us reduce the consumption of imported oil than have to send American boys to fight in the Persian Gulf. But at the same time, I think its going to take a dramatic measure of that kind to convince the American people that we will have to reduce the use of the private automobile. We simply cannot have people sitting one behind the wheel of a car in these long traffic jams going in and out of our great cities. We are going to have to resort to van pooling, to car pooling. Were going to have to develop better community transportation systems, so that with buses and light rail, we can replace the private automobile in those places where it clearly is not energy-efficient. I think that, with respect to housing, when we are consuming, even though our per capita income today is about the same as that of the Federal Republic of Germany, we are consuming about, by a factor of two, the amount of energy that they consume in that country. Surely, there are things that we can do in the retrofitting, ;n the redesign of our homes, not only of our houses, but of our commercial structures, as well, that will make it possible for us to achieve. According to one study that was published a short time ago  the Harvard Business School study  indicated that just in the commercial sector alone of the economy, we could save between 30% and 40% of the energy that we consume in this country today. So I think, yes, we will have to change in a very appreciable way, some of the lifestyles that we now enjoy.",1980-09-21,Independent

Reagan,"Well, as Ive said, I am not an enemy of conservation. I wouldnt be called a conservative if I were. But, when my figures are challenged, as the President himself challenged them after I made them, I think it should be called to the attention of John and the others here that my figures are the figures of the Department of Energy, which has not been overly optimistic in recent years as to how much supply we have left. That is the same Government that, in 1920, told us we only had enough oil left for 13 years, and 19 years later, told us we only had enough left for another 15 years. As for saving energy and conserving, the American people havent been doing badly at that. Because in industry today, were producing more, over the last several years, and at 12% less use of energy than we were back in about 1973. And motorists are using 8% less than they were back at that time of the oil embargo. So, I think we are proving that we can go forward with conservation and benefit from that. But also, I think it is safe to say that we do have sources of energy that have not yet been used or found.",1980-09-21,Republican
Moyers,Mr. Anderson.,1980-09-21,Moderator
Anderson,"Mr. Greenberg, I think my opponent in this debate tonight is overlooking one other very important fact. And that is, that we cannot look at this as simply a national problem. Even though its true that, perhaps, between now and the end of the decade, our total consumption of oil may not increase by more than, perhaps, a million or 2 million barrels of oil a day. The rest of the Western world, we are told, may see its consumption increase from 51 million barrels to about 66 million. And that additional 15 million barrels is going to cause scarcity. It is going to cause scarcity in world markets because there are at least five reputable studies, one even by the American Petroleum Institute itself, that, I think, clearly indicate that somewhere along around the end of the present decade, total world demand for oil is simply going to exceed total available supplies. I think that conservation  I think that a change in lifestyles  is necessary, and we had better begin to plan for that now rather than later.",1980-09-21,Independent
Moyers,"This question goes to you, Mr. Anderson, from Charles Corddry.",1980-09-21,Moderator
Anderson,"Mr. Corddry, I am well aware of the present deficiencies in the Armed Forces of this country. When you have a report, as we did recently, that six out of 10 CONUS Divisions in this country  Continental United States Army Divisions  simply could not pass a readiness test: that two out of three divisions that were to be allocated to the so-called Rapid Deployment Force could not meet a readiness test. And in most cases, that failure to meet the test was because of a lack of manning requirements, an inability to fill many of the slots in those divisions. Yes, I have seen figures that indicate that perhaps as of September, 1980  this very month  that there is a shortage of about 104,000 in the ranks between E-4 and E-9. And there were reports. public reports not long ago about ships that could not leave American ports because of a lack of crews. I talked to one of the leading former chiefs of Naval operations in my office a few weeks ago, who told me about 25,000 Chief Petty Officers being short. But, I think that that is clearly related to the fact that, going back to the time when the all-volunteer Army was created in 1973  and I worked hard for it and supported it  we simply have failed to keep pace with the cost of living. And today, on the average, the average serviceman is at least 15%  and I happen to think thats a very modest estimate  15% below what has happened to the cost of living over that period of time. And as a result, the families of some of our young servicemen are on food stamps today. And I think thats shocking; its shameful. So, yes, I told the American Legion National! Convention, the VFW National Convention  when I spoke to each of those bodies  I outlined a very specific program of increasing pay and allowances, reenlistment bonuses. That only makes sense. But I would leave you with this thought, sir, to be quite specific in my answer to your question: that, of course, to protect the vital interests of this country, if that became impossible; if I could not, despite the very best efforts that I asked the Congress to put forward, to raise those pay and incentives and allowances, of course, I would not leave this country go undefended.",1980-09-21,Independent

Reagan,"Mr. Corddry, its a shame now that there are only two of us here debating, because the two that are here are in more agreement than disagreement on this particular issue, and the only one who would be disagreeing with us is the President, if he were present. I. too, believe in the voluntary military. As a matter of fact, today the shortages of non-commissioned officers that John mentioned are such that if we tried to have a draft today, we wouldnt have the non-commissioned officers to train the draftees. I believe the answer lies in just recognizing human nature and how we make everything else work in this country, when we want it to work. Recognize that we have a voluntary military. We are asking for men and women to join the military as a career, and were asking them to deal with the most sophisticated of equipment. And a young man is out there on a $1 billion carrier in charge of the maintenance of a $20 million aircraft, working 100 hours a week at times, and hes earning less for himself and his family, while hes away from his family, than he could earn if he were in one of the most menial jobs, working 40 hours a week here at home. As an aid to enlistment. we had an aid  46% of the people who enlisted in the voluntary military up until 1977 said they did so for one particular reason, the G.I. Bill of Rights  the fact that, by serving in the military, they could provide for a future college education. In 1977, we took that away from the military. That meant immediately 46% of your people that were signing up had no reason for signing up. So I think it is a case of pay scale, of recognizing that if were going to have young men and women responsible for our security, dealing with this sophisticated equipment, then for heavens sakes, lets go out and have a pay scale that is commensurate with the sacrifice that were asking of them. Along with this, I think we need something else that has been allowed to deteriorate. We need a million-man active reserve that could be called up on an instants notice, and that would be also trained, ready to use that type of equipment. Both of these, I think, would respond to the proper kind of incentives that we could offer these people. The other day, I just  Ill hasten  I just saw one example. Down in Texas. I saw a high school that is military.",1980-09-21,Republican

Anderson,"Mr. Moyers. I must say that I think I have better opportunity, however, of finding the necessary funds to pay what, admittedly, will be very, very substantial sums of money. We signed one bill. or we passed one bill, just a couple of weeks ago in the House of Representatives for $500 million  a half a billion dollars. That is just a downpayment, in my opinion. But, unlike Governor Reagan, I do not support a boondoggle like the MX missile. Ive just gotten a report from the Air Force that indicates that the 30-year lifecycle cost of that system is going to be $100 billion. The initial cost is about $54 billion, and then when you add in the additional costs  not only the construction of the system, the missiles and the personnel, and so on  when you add in the additional costs over the lifecycle of that system, over $100 billion. I would propose to save the taxpayers of this country from that kind of costly boondoggle.",1980-09-21,Independent
Moyers,Mr. Reagan?,1980-09-21,Moderator
Reagan,"Well, let me just say that, with regard to that same missile system, I happen to support and believe in the missile, itself. But thats not the $54 billion cost that John is talking about. Hes talking about that fantastic plan of the Administration to take thousands and thousands of square miles out in the Western states. And first, he was going to dig a racetrack and have it going around in the racetrack so it would meet the requirements of SALT II treaty, and now hes decided itll have a straight up and down thing, so it can he both verifiable and yet hideable from the Soviet Union. We need the missile, I think, because we are so out of balance strategically that we lack a deterrent to a possible first assault. But I am not in favor of the plan that is so costly. And therefore, if I only had another second left, Id say that that high school class in a military training  40 of its 80 graduates last year entered the United States service academies; West Point, Annapolis and the Air Force Academy, and to see those young men made me very proud to realize that there are young people in this country that are prepared to go into that kind of a career in service of their country.",1980-09-21,Republican
Moyers,"This question comes to you, Mr. Reagan, from my colleague, Lee May.",1980-09-21,Moderator
Reagan,"I dont think Id have to go against that pledge. I think one of the problems today with the cities is Federal aid. The mayors that Ive talked to in some of our leading cities tell! me that the Federal grants that come with. for a specific cause or a specific objective, come with such red tape, such priorities established by a bureaucracy in Washington, that the local governments hands are tied with regard to using that money as they feel could best be used, and for what they think might be the top priority. If they had that money without those government restrictions, every one of them has told me they could make great savings and make far greater use of the money. What I have been advocating is, why dont we start with the Federal Government turning back tax sources to states and local governments, as well as the responsibilities for those programs? Seventy-five percent of the people live in the cities. I dont know of a city in America that doesnt have the kind of problems youre talking about. But, where are we getting the money that the Federal Government is putting out to help them? New York is being taxed for money that will then go to Detroit. But Detroit is being taxed for money that, lets say, will go to Chicago, while Chicago is being taxed to help with the problems in Philadelphia. Wouldnt it make a lot more sense if the government let them keep their own money there in the first place? But there are other things that we can do with the inner cities, and Ive believed. I have talked of having zones in those cities that are run down, where there is a high percentage of people on welfare, and offer tax incentives. The government isnt getting a tax now from businesses there because they arent there, or from individuals who are on welfare rather than working. And why dont we offer incentives for business and industry to start up in those zones? Give them a tax moratorium for a period if they build and develop there. The individuals that would then get jobs  give them a break that encourages them to leave the social welfare programs and go to work. We could have an urban homestead act. Weve got thousands and thousands of homes owned by government boarded up, being vandalized, that have been taken in mortgage foreclosures. What if we had a homestead act, and said to the people, for $1 we sell you this house. All have to do is agree to refurbish it, make it habitable, and live in it  just as 100 or more years ago, we did with the open land in this country  urban . or country homesteading.",1980-09-21,Republican
Moyers,Mr. May?,1980-09-21,Moderator
May,"Mr. Anderson, let me ask you, what specific plans do you have for Federal involvement in saving cities from the physical and emotional crises that confront them, and how would you carry out those plans, in addition to raising military pay, without going against your pledge of fiscal restraint?",1980-09-21,Moderator
Anderson,"Mr. May, I recently saw a Princeton University study that indicated that the cities of America  the large cities of this country  are in worse shape today than they were in 1960. It seems to totally belie the claim that I heard President Carter make a few days ago, that he was the first President that had come forth with a real urban strategy to meet the problems of urban America. Incidentally, just this past week, the crown jewel in that program that he had devised was stolen, I guess, because a conference committee turned down the ambitious plan that he had to increase the amount of money that would be available to the Economic Development Administration for loan guarantees and direct loans and credits. Im happy to say that, in contrast to that, the Anderson-Lucey platform for America, program for the 80s, has devoted considerable time, and in very specific detail, we have talked about two things that ought to be done to aid urban America. We call, first of all, for the creation of a $4 billion urban reinvestment trust fund to do exactly what you spoke about in your question  to rebuild the streets, to rebuild the cities, the leaking water mains. I was in North Pittsburgh  I think it was a few weeks ago, on my campaign  the water mains in that city had begun to leak, and literally, there wasnt money available to fix them. And until we can begin to recreate the basic infrastructure of the great cities of America, particularly in the upper Midwest and in the Northeast, they simply are not going to provide the kind of economic climate that will enable them to retain industry, enable them to retain the kind of solid industrial base that they need, so that they can provide jobs. We have also provided in our program for a $4 billion Community Trust Fund, and weve told you where the money is coming from. Its going to come from the dedication, by 1984, of the excise revenues that today are being collected by the Federal Government on alcohol and tobacco. That money, I think, ought to be put into rebuilding the base of our cities. In addition to that, jobs programs to re-employ the youth in our cities would be very high on my priority list, both the Youth Opportunities Act of 1980 and a billion-dollar program that I would recommend to put youth to work in energy projects, in conservation projects, in projects that would carry out some of the great national goals of our country.",1980-09-21,Independent
Moyers,"Mr. Reagan, your response.",1980-09-21,Moderator
Reagan,"Yes. Government claims. John claims that he is making plain where the money will come from. It will come from the pockets of the people. It will come from the pockets of the people who are living in those very areas. And the problem is, with Governments  Federal, State and Local  taking $.44 out of every dollar earned, that the Federal Government has pre-empted too many of the tax sources, and that the cities. if Pittsburgh does not have the money to fix the leaking water mains, its because the Federal Government has pre-empted. Now, the Federal Government is going to turn around and say, well you have this problem; we will now hand you the money to do it. But the Federal Government doesnt make money. It just takes  from the people. And in my view, this is not the answer to the problem. Stand in the South Bronx as I did, in the spot where Jimmy Carter made his promise that he was going to, with multi-billion dollar programs, refurbish that area that looks like bombed-out London in World War II. I stood there, and I met the people. And I heard them ask just for something that would give them hope. And I believe that, while all of the promises have been broken, theyve never been carried out. But I believe that my plan might offer an opportunity for that, if we would move into those areas and let, encourage  with the tax incentive  the private sector, to develop and to create the jobs for the people.",1980-09-21,Republican
Moyers,Mr. Anderson.,1980-09-21,Moderator
Anderson,"Well, of course, where has the private sector been, Governor Reagan, during the years that our cities have been deteriorating? It seems to me that to deny the responsibility of the Federal Government to do something about our crumbling cities is to deny the opportunity for one thing: To 55% of the black population of our country that is locked within the inner cities of the metropolitan areas of our country. We simply cannot ignore the fact that, in those cities today, we have 55% youth unemployment among black and Hispanic youth. And why is that? Its because they have lost their industry. And why have they lost their industry? Its because they no longer present the kind of viable economic climate that makes it possible for industry to remain there, or to locate there. I think Government has a responsibility to find jobs for the youth of this country, and that the place to start is to assist in the very important and necessary task of helping cities rebuild.",1980-09-21,Independent
Moyers,"Jane Bryant Quinn has the next question, for you, Mr. Anderson. JANE BRYANT QUINN, CBS NEWS/NEWSWEEK/WASHINGTON POST: Mr. Anderson, many voters are very worried that tax cuts, nice as they are, will actually add to inflation. And many eminent conservatives have testified that even business tax cuts, as you have proposed, can be inflationary as long as we have a budget deficit. Now, Mr. Reagan has mentioned that he put out a five-year economic forecast, which indeed he did, but it contained no inflation number. You have published a detailed program, but it too does not have any hard numbers on it about how these things work with inflation. So I would like to ask you, if you will commit to publish specific forecasts within two weeks, so that the voters can absorb them and understand them and analyze them, showing exactly what al these problems youve mentioned tonight  on energy, on defense, on the cities  how these impact on inflation, and what inflations actually going to be over five years.",1980-09-21,Moderator
Anderson,"Miss Quinn, I would be very happy to accept the challenge of your question tonight, to tell the voters of this country exactly what I think its going to cost, because I believe that all too often in past elections, politicians have simply been promising people things that they cannot deliver. When these Presidential Debates were held just four years ago, I remember the incumbent President, who was willing to debate, President Ford, telling the American people that they simply ought not to vote for somebody who promised more than they could deliver. Well, weve seen what has happened. We havent gotten either the economies in Government that were promised; we havent gotten the 4% inflation that we were supposed to get at the end of Mr. Carters first term. Instead we had, I think, in the second quarter, a Consumer Price Index registering around 12%. And nobody really knows, with the latest increase in the Wholesale Price Index  thats about 18% on an annualized basis  what its going to be. Let me say this. I think my programs are far less inflationary than those of Governor Reagan. His own running mate, when he was running for the Presidency, said that they would cost 30% inflation inside of two years, and he cited his leading economic advisor, a very distinguished economist, Paul Macavoy, as the source of that information. He went so far as to call it brutal economics. Ive been very careful  I have been very careful in saying that what Im going to do is to bring Federal spending under control first. I would like to stand here and promise the American people a tax cut, as Governor Reagan has done. But, you know, its gotten to be about $122 difference. Somebody worked it out. And they figured out that between the tax cut that Governor Reagan is promising the American people, and the tax cut that Jimmy Carter is promising in 198I, his is worth about $122 more. So you, dear voters, are out there on the auction block, and these two candidates are bidding for your votes. And one is going to give you $122 more if you happen to be in that range of about a $20,000-a-year income. Im going to wait until I see that that inflation rate is going down, before I even begin to phase in the business tax cuts that Ive talked about. But I think, by improving productivity, they would be far less inflationary than the consumption-oriented tax cut that Governor Reagan is recommending.",1980-09-21,Independent
Moyers,Ms. Quinn.,1980-09-21,Moderator
Quinn,"Mr. Anderson, Ill call you for that forecast. Mr. Reagan, will you publish specific forecasts within two weeks, so that the voters can have time to analyze and absorb them before the election, showing exactly what all these things youve discussed tonight  for energy, cities and defense  mean for inflation over the next five years?",1980-09-21,Moderator
Reagan,"Miss Quinn, I dont have to. Ive done it. We have a back-up paper to my economic speech of a couple of weeks ago in Chicago, that gives all of the figures. And we used  yes, we used  the Senate Budget Committees projections for five years, which are based on an average inflation rate of 7.5%  which, I think, that under our plan, can be eliminated. And eliminated probably more quickly than our plan, but we wanted to be so conservative with it, that people would see how. how well it could be done. Now, Johns been in the Congress for 20 years. And John tells us that first, weve got to reduce spending before we can reduce taxes. Well, if youve got a kid thats extravagant, you can lecture him all you want to about his extravagance. Or you can cut his allowance and achieve the same end much quicker. But Government has never reduced Government does not tax to get the money it needs. Government always needs the money it gets. And when John talks about his non-inflationary plan, as far as I have been able to learn, there are 88 proposals in it that call for additional Government spending programs. Now, I speak with some confidence of our plan, because I took over a state  California  10% of the population of this nation  a state that, if it were a nation, would be the seventh-ranking economic power in the world. And that state we controlled spending. We cut the rate of increase in spending in half. But at the same time, we gave back to the people of California  in tax rebates, tax credits, tax cuts  $5.7 billion. I vetoed 993 measures without having a veto overturned. And among those vetoes, I stopped $16 billion in additional spending. And the funny thing was that California, which is normally above the national average in inflation and unemployment, for those six years for the first time, was below the national average in both inflation and unemployment. We have considered inflation in our figures. We deliberately took figures that we, ourselves, believed were too conservative. I believe the budget can be balanced by 1982 or 1983, and it is a combination of planned reduction of the tax increase that Carter has built into the economy, and thats what hes counting on for his plan. But hes going to get a half-a-trillion dollars more over the next five years that he can use for additional programs, or hopefully, someplace down the line, balancing the budget. We believe that thats too much additional money to take out of the pockets of the people.",1980-09-21,Republican
Moyers,Mr. Anderson.,1980-09-21,Moderator
Anderson,"Mr. Moyers, Im not here to debate Governor Reagans record as Governor. This is 1980 and not 1966. But I do know that, despite his pledge to reduce state Government spending, that it rose from $4.6 billion when he took office in 1967, to $10.2 billion during his eight years in office. Spending, in other words. more than doubled, and it rose at a faster rate than spending was rising in the Federal Government. But on his very optimistic figures about his tax cut producing a balanced budget by 1983, and the fact that he is using, he says, the figures of the Senate Budget Committee, that Senate Budget Committee Report does not accommodate all of the Reagan defense plans. It doesnt accommodate the expenditures that he calls for, for accelerated development and deployment of a new manned strategic bomber, for a permanent fleet in the Indian Ocean, for the restoration of the fleet to 600 ships, to the development and deployment of a dedicated modern aircraft interceptor. In other words, I have seen his program costed out to the point where it would amount to more than $300 million a year, just for the military. And I think the figures that he has given are simply not going to stand up.",1980-09-21,Independent
Moyers,"Would would you have a comment, Mr. Reagan?",1980-09-21,Moderator
Reagan,"Well, some people look up figures, and some people make up figures. And John has just made up some very interesting figures. We took the Senate report, of course. But we did factor in our own ideas with regard to increases in the projected military spending that we believe would, over a period of time, do what is necessary. Now also, with regard to the figures about California. The truth of the matter is, we did cut the increase in spending in half. It at the John doesnt quite realize  hes never held an executive position of that kind. And I think being Governor of California is probably the closest thing to the Presidency, if thats possible, of any executive job in America today  because it is the most populous state. And I can only tell him that we reduced, in proportion of other states, the per capita spending, the per capita size of Government  we only increased the size of Government one-twelfth what it had increased in the preceding eight years. And one journal, the San Francisco Chronicle, a respected newspaper, said there was no question about the fact that Governor Reagan had prevented the State of California from going bankrupt.",1980-09-21,Republican

Golden,Mr. Reagan.,1980-09-21,Moderator
Reagan,"Oh, Im its my question. But whether I agree or disagree with some individual, or what he may say, or how he may say it, I dont think theres any way that we can suggest that because people believe in God and go to church, that they should not want reflected in those people and those causes they support, their own belief in morality, and in the high traditions and principles which weve abandoned so much in this country. Going around this country, I think that I have found a great hunger in America for a spiritual revival. For a belief that law must be based on a higher law. For a return to traditions and values that we once had. Our Government, in its most sacred documents  the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence and all  speak of man being created, of a Creator. That were a nation under God. Now, I have thought for a long time that too many of our churches have been too reluctant to speak up in behalf of what they believe is proper in Government, and they have been too too lax in interfering, in recent years, with Governments invasion of the family itself, putting itself between parent and child. I vetoed a number of bills of that kind myself, when I was in California. Now, whether it is rightful, on a single issue, for anyone to advocate that someone should not be elected or not, I wont take a position on that. But I do believe that no one in this country should be denied the right to express themselves, or to even try to persuade others to follow their leader. Thats what elections are all about.",1980-09-21,Republican

Golden,"Okay. I would point out that churches are tax-exempt institutions, and Ill repeat my question. Do you approve the Churchs action this week in Boston, and should a President be guided by organized religion on issues like abortion, equal rights and defense spending?",1980-09-21,Moderator
Anderson,"Ms. Golden, certainly the church has the right to take a position on moral issues. But to try, as occurred in the case that you mentioned  that specific case  to try to tell the parishioners of any church, of any denomination, how they should vote, or for whom they should vote, I think violates the principle of separation of church and state. Now, Governor Reagan is running on a platform that calls for a Constitutional amendment banning abortion. I think that is a moral issue that ought to be left to the freedom of conscience of the individual. And for the state to interfere with a Constitutional amendment, and tell a woman that she must carry that pregnancy to term, regardless of her personal belief, that, I think, violates freedom of conscience as much as anything that I can think of. And he is also running on a platform that suggests a litmus test for the selection of judges  that only judges that hold a certain, quote, view, on the sanctity of family life, ought to be appointed to the Federal Judiciary, one of the three great independent branches of our Government. No. I believe in freedom of choice. I dont believe in Constitutional Amendments that would interfere with that. I dont believe in trying to legislate new tests for the selection of the Federal Judiciary. On the Amendment that you mentioned, I abandoned it 15 years ago. And I have said freely, all over this country, that it was a mistake for me or anyone to ever try to put the Judeo-Christian heritage of this country, important as it is, and important as my religious faith is to me  its a very deeply personal matter. But for me to try, in this very pluralistic society of ours, to try to frame any definition, whatever, of what that belief should be, is wrong. And so, not once, but twice  in 1971  I voted on the floor of the House of Representatives against a Constitutional amendment that tried to bring prayer back into the public schools. I think mother ought to whisper to Johnny and to Susie, as they button their coats in the morning and leave for the classroom, Be sure to say a prayer before you start your days work. But I dont think that the state, the Board of Regents, a Board of Education, or any state official, should try to compose that prayer for a child to recite.",1980-09-21,Independent

Reagan,"The litmus test that John says is in the Republican platform, says no more than the judges to be appointed should have a respect for innocent life. Now, I dont think thats a bad idea. I think all of us should have a respect for innocent life. With regard to the freedom of the individual for choice with regard to abortion, theres one individual whos not being considered at all. Thats the one who is being aborted. And Ive noticed that everybody that is for abortion has already been born. I I think that, technically, I know this is a difficult and an emotional problem, and many people sincerely feel on both sides of this, but I do believe that maybe we could find the answer through medical evidence, if we would determine once and for all, is an unborn child a human being? I happen to believe it is.",1980-09-21,Republican

And for the state to interfere in that decision, under whatever guise, and with whatever rationale, for the state to try to take over in that situation, and by edict, command what the individual shall do, and substitute itself for that individuals conscience, for her right to consult her rabbi, her minister, her priest, her doctor  any other counselor of her choice  I think goes beyond what we want to ever see accomplished in this country, if we really believe in the First Amendment: if we really believe in freedom of choice and the right of the individual.",1980-09-21,Independent

And there might be some feeling of unfairness about this because he was not here to respond. But I believe it would have been much more unfair to have had John Anderson denied the right to participate in this debate. And I want to express my appreciation to the League of Women Voters for adopting a course with which I believe the great majority of Americans are in agreement. Now, as to my closing remarks: Ive always believed that this land was placed here between the two great oceans by some divine plan. That it was placed here to be found by a special kind of people  people who had a special love for freedom and who had the courage to uproot themselves and leave hearth and homeland, and came to what, in the beginning, was the most undeveloped wilderness possible. We came from 100 different corners of the earth. We spoke a multitude of tongues. We landed on this Eastern shore and then went out over the mountains and the prairies and the deserts and the far western mountains to the Pacific, building cities and towns and farms, and schools and churches. If wind, water or fire destroyed them, we built them again. And in so doing, at the same time, we built a new breed of human called an American  a proud, an independent., and a most compassionate individual, for the most part. Two hundred years ago, Tom Paine, when the 13 tiny colonies were trying to become a nation, said, we have it in our power to begin the world over again. Today. were confronted with the horrendous problems that weve discussed here tonight. And some people in high positions of leadership, tell us that the answer is to retreat. That the best is over. That we must cut back. That we must share in an ever-increasing scarcity. That we must, in the failure to be able to protect our national security as it is today, we must not be provocative to any possible adversary. Well, we, the living Americans, have gone through four wars. Weve gone through a Great Depression in our lifetime that literally was worldwide and almost brought us to our knees. But we came through all of those things and we achieved even new heights and new greatness. The living Americans today have fought harder, paid a higher price for freedom, and done more to advance the dignity of man than any people who ever lived on this earth. For 200 years, weve lived in the future, believing that tomorrow would be better than today, and today would be better than yesterday. I still believe that. Im not running for the Presidency because I believe that I can solve the problems weve discussed tonight. I believe the people of this country can, and together, we can begin the world over again. We can meet our destiny  and that destiny to build a land here that will be, for all mankind, a shining city on a hill. I think we ought to get at it.",1980-09-21,Republican

Anderson,"Mr. Movers, President Carter was not right a few weeks ago when he said that the American people were confronted with only two choices, with only two men, and with only two parties. I think youve seen tonight in this debate that Governor Reagan and I have agreed on exactly one thing  we are both against the reimposition of a peacetime draft. We have disagreed, I believe, on virtually every other issue. I respect him for showing tonight  for appearing here, and I thank the League of Women Voters for the opportunity that they have given me. I am running for President as an Independent because I believe our country is in trouble. I believe that all of us are going to have to begin to work together to solve our problems. If you think that I am a spoiler, consider these facts: Do you really think that our economy is healthy? Do you really think that 8 million Americans being out of work and the 50% unemployment among the youth of our country are acceptable? Do you really think that our armed forces are really acceptably strong in those areas of conventional capability where they should be? Do you think that our political institutions are working the way they should when literally only half of our citizens vote? I dont think you do think that. And therefore, I think you ought to consider doing something about it, and voting for an Independent in 1980. You know, a generation of office seekers has tried to tell the American people that they could get something for nothing. Its been a time, therefore, of illusion and false hopes, and the longer it continues, the more dangerous it becomes. Weve got to stop drifting. What I wish tonight so desperately is that we had had more time to talk about some of the other issues that are so fundamentally important. A great historian, Henry Steele Commager, said that in their lust for victory, neither traditional party is looking beyond November. And he went on to cite three issues that their platforms totally ignore: atomic warfare, Presidential Directive 59 notwithstanding. If we dont resolve that issue, all others become irrelevant. The issue of our natural resources; the right of posterity to inherit the earth, and what kind of earth will it be? The issue of nationalism  the recognition, he says, that every major problem confronting us is global, and cannot be solved by nationalism here or elsewhere  that is chauvinistic, that is parochial, that is as anachronistic as states rights was in the days of Jefferson Davis. Those are some of the great issues  atomic warfare, the use of our natural resources, and the issue of nationalism  that I intend to be talking about in the remaining six weeks of this campaign, and I dare hope that the American people will be listening and that they will see that an Independent government of John Anderson and Patrick Lucey can give us the kind of coalition government that we need in 1980 to begin to solve our problems.

Schieffer,"Good evening from Arizona State University in Tempe, Arizona. Im Bob Schieffer of CBS News. I want to welcome you to the third and last of the 2004 debates between President George Bush and Senator John Kerry. As Jim Lehrer told you before the first one, these debates are sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates. Tonight the topic will be domestic affairs, but the format will be the same as that first debate. Ill moderate our discussion under detailed rules agreed to by the candidates, but the questions and the areas to be covered were chosen by me. I have not told the candidates or anyone else what they are. To refresh your memory on the rules, I will ask a question. The candidate is allowed two minutes to answer. His opponent then has a minute and a half to offer a rebuttal. At my discretion, I can extend the discussion by offering each candidate an additional 30 seconds. A green light will come on to signal the candidate has 30 seconds left. A yellow light signals 15 seconds left. A red light means five seconds left. There is also a buzzer, if it is needed. The candidates may not question each other directly. There are no opening statements, but there will be two-minute closing statements. There is an audience here tonight, but they have agreed to remain silent, except for right now, when they join me in welcoming President George Bush and Senator John Kerry. Gentlemen, welcome to you both. By coin toss, the first question goes to Senator Kerry. Senator, I want to set the stage for this discussion by asking the question that I think hangs over all of our politics today and is probably on the minds of many people watching this debate tonight.",2004-10-13,Moderator
Kerry,"Well, first of all, Bob, thank you for moderating tonight. Thank you, Arizona State, for welcoming us. And thank you to the Presidential Commission for undertaking this enormous task. Were proud to be here. Mr. President, Im glad to be here with you again to share similarities and differences with the American people. Will we ever be safe and secure again? Yes. We absolutely must be. Thats the goal. Now, how do we achieve it is the most critical component of it. I believe that this president, regrettably, rushed us into a war, made decisions about foreign policy, pushed alliances away. And, as a result, America is now bearing this extraordinary burden where we are not as safe as we ought to be. The measurement is not: Are we safer? The measurement is: Are we as safe as we ought to be? And there are a host of options that this president had available to him, like making sure that at all our ports in America containers are inspected. Only 95 percent of them  95 percent come in today uninspected. Thats not good enough. People who fly on airplanes today, the cargo hold is not X-rayed, but the baggage is. Thats not good enough. Firehouses dont have enough firefighters in them. Police officers are being cut from the streets of America because the president decided to cut the COPS program. So we can do a better job of homeland security. I can do a better job of waging a smarter, more effective war on terror and guarantee that we will go after the terrorists. I will hunt them down, and well kill them, well capture them. Well do whatever is necessary to be safe. But I pledge this to you, America: I will do it in the way that Franklin Roosevelt and Ronald Reagan and John Kennedy and others did, where we build the strongest alliances, where the world joins together, where we have the best intelligence and where we are able, ultimately, to be more safe and secure.",2004-10-13,Democrat
Schieffer,"Mr. President, you have 90 seconds.",2004-10-13,Moderator
Bush,"Bob, thank you very much. I want to thank Arizona State as well. Yes, we can be safe and secure, if we stay on the offense against the terrorists and if we spread freedom and liberty around the world. I have got a comprehensive strategy to not only chase down the Al Qaida, wherever it exists  and were making progress; three-quarters of Al Qaida leaders have been brought to justice  but to make sure that countries that harbor terrorists are held to account. As a result of securing ourselves and ridding the Taliban out of Afghanistan, the Afghan people had elections this weekend. And the first voter was a 19-year-old woman. Think about that. Freedom is on the march. We held to account a terrorist regime in Saddam Hussein. In other words, in order to make sure were secure, there must be a comprehensive plan. My opponent just this weekend talked about how terrorism could be reduced to a nuisance, comparing it to prostitution, illegal gambling. I think that attitude and that point of view is dangerous. I dont think you can secure America for the long run if you dont have a comprehensive view as to how to defeat these people. At home, well do everything we can to protect the homeland. I signed the homeland security bill to better align our assets and resources. My opponent voted against it. Were doing everything we can to protect our borders and ports. But absolutely we can be secure in the long run. It just takes good, strong leadership.",2004-10-13,Republican
Schieffer,"Anything to add, Senator Kerry?",2004-10-13,Moderator
Kerry,"Yes. When the president had an opportunity to capture or kill Osama bin Laden, he took his focus off of them, outsourced the job to Afghan warlords, and Osama bin Laden escaped. Six months after he said Osama bin Laden must be caught dead or alive, this president was asked, Where is Osama bin Laden?  He said, I dont know. I dont really think about him very much. Im not that concerned. We need a president who stays deadly focused on the real war on terror.",2004-10-13,Democrat
Schieffer,Mr. President?,2004-10-13,Moderator
Bush,"Gosh, I just dont think I ever said Im not worried about Osama bin Laden. Its kind of one of those exaggerations. Of course were worried about Osama bin Laden. Were on the hunt after Osama bin Laden. Were using every asset at our disposal to get Osama bin Laden. My opponent said this war is a matter of intelligence and law enforcement. No, this war is a matter of using every asset at our disposal to keep the American people protected.",2004-10-13,Republican
Schieffer,"New question, Mr. President, to you. We are talking about protecting ourselves from the unexpected, but the flu season is suddenly upon us. Flu kills thousands of people every year.",2004-10-13,Moderator
Bush,"Bob, we relied upon a company out of England to provide about half of the flu vaccines for the United States citizen, and it turned out that the vaccine they were producing was contaminated. And so we took the right action and didnt allow contaminated medicine into our country. Were working with Canada to hopefully  that theyll produce a  help us realize the vaccine necessary to make sure our citizens have got flu vaccinations during this upcoming season. My call to our fellow Americans is if youre healthy, if youre younger, dont get a flu shot this year. Help us prioritize those who need to get the flu shot, the elderly and the young. The CDC, responsible for health in the United States, is setting those priorities and is allocating the flu vaccine accordingly. I havent gotten a flu shot, and I dont intend to because I want to make sure those who are most vulnerable get treated. We have a problem with litigation in the United States of America. Vaccine manufacturers are worried about getting sued, and therefore they have backed off from providing this kind of vaccine. One of the reasons Im such a strong believer in legal reform is so that people arent afraid of producing a product that is necessary for the health of our citizens and then end up getting sued in a court of law. But the best thing we can do now, Bob, given the circumstances with the company in England is for those of us who are younger and healthy, dont get a flu shot.",2004-10-13,Republican
Schieffer,Senator Kerry?,2004-10-13,Moderator
Kerry,"This really underscores the problem with the American health-care system. Its not working for the American family. And its gotten worse under President Bush over the course of the last years. Five million Americans have lost their health insurance in this country. Youve got about a million right here in Arizona, just shy, 950,000, who have no health insurance at all. 82,000 Arizonians lost their health insurance under President Bushs watch. 223,000 kids in Arizona have no health insurance at all. All across our country  go to Ohio, 1. 4 million Ohioans have no health insurance, 114,000 of them lost it under President Bush; Wisconsin, 82,000 Wisconsinites lost it under President Bush. This president has turned his back on the wellness of America. And there is no system. In fact, its starting to fall apart not because of lawsuits  though they are a problem, and John Edwards and I are committed to fixing them  but because of the larger issue that we dont cover Americans. Children across our country dont have health care. Were the richest country on the face of the planet, the only industrialized nation in the world not to do it. I have a plan to cover all Americans. Were going to make it affordable and accessible. Were going to let everybody buy into the same health-care plan senators and congressmen give themselves.",2004-10-13,Democrat
Schieffer,"Mr. President, would you like to add something?",2004-10-13,Moderator
Bush,"I would. Thank you. I want to remind people listening tonight that a plan is not a litany of complaints, and a plan is not to lay out programs that you cant pay for. He just said he wants everybody to be able to buy in to the same plan that senators and congressmen get. That costs the government $7,700 per family. If every family in America signed up, like the senator suggested, if would cost us $5 trillion over 10 years. Its an empty promise. Its called bait and switch.",2004-10-13,Republican

Bush,Thank you.,2004-10-13,Republican
Kerry,"Actually, its not an empty promise. Its really interesting, because the president used that very plan as a reason for seniors to accept his prescription drug plan. He said, if its good enough for the congressmen and senators to have choice, seniors ought to have choice. What we do is we have choice. I choose Blue Cross/Blue Shield. Other senators, other congressmen choose other programs. But the fact is, were going to help Americans be able to buy into it. Those that can afford it are going to buy in themselves. Were not giving this away for nothing.",2004-10-13,Democrat
Schieffer,"All right. Senator Kerry, a new question. Lets talk about economic security. You pledged during the last debate that you would not raise taxes on those making less than $200,000 a year. But the price of everything is going up, and we all know it. Health-care costs, as you are talking about, is skyrocketing, the cost of the war.",2004-10-13,Moderator
Kerry,"Ill tell you exactly how I can do it: by reinstating what President Bush took away, which is called pay as you go. During the 1990s, we had pay-as-you-go rules. If you were going to pass something in the Congress, you had to show where you are going to pay for it and how. President Bush has taken  hes the only president in history to do this. Hes also the only president in 72 years to lose jobs  1. 6 million jobs lost. Hes the only president to have incomes of families go down for the last three years; the only president to see exports go down; the only president to see the lowest level of business investment in our country as it is today. Now, Im going to reverse that. Im going to change that. Were going to restore the fiscal discipline we had in the 1990s. Every plan that I have laid out  my health-care plan, my plan for education, my plan for kids to be able to get better college loans  Ive shown exactly how Im going to pay for those. And we start  we dont do it exclusively  but we start by rolling back George Bushs unaffordable tax cut for the wealthiest people, people earning more than $200,000 a year, and we pass, hopefully, the McCain-Kerry Commission which identified some $60 billion that we can get. We shut the loophole which has American workers actually subsidizing the loss of their own job. They just passed an expansion of that loophole in the last few days: $43 billion of giveaways, including favors to the oil and gas industry and the people importing ceiling fans from China. Im going to stand up and fight for the American worker. And I am going to do it in a way thats fiscally sound. I show how I pay for the health care, how we pay for the education. I have a manufacturing jobs credit. We pay for it by shutting that loophole overseas. We raise the student loans. I pay for it by changing the relationship with the banks. This president has never once vetoed one bill; the first president in a hundred years not to do that.",2004-10-13,Democrat
Schieffer,Mr. President?,2004-10-13,Moderator
Bush,"Well, his rhetoric doesnt match his record. He been a senator for 20 years. He voted to increase taxes 98 times. When they tried to reduce taxes, he voted against that 127 times. He talks about being a fiscal conservative, or fiscally sound, but he voted over  he voted 277 times to waive the budget caps, which would have cost the taxpayers $4. 2 trillion. He talks about PAYGO. Ill tell you what PAYGO means, when youre a senator from Massachusetts, when youre a colleague of Ted Kennedy, pay go means: You pay, and he goes ahead and spends. Hes proposed $2. 2 trillion of new spending, and yet the so-called tax on the rich, which is also a tax on many small-business owners in America, raises $600 million by our account  billion, $800 billion by his account. There is a tax gap. And guess who usually ends up filling the tax gap? The middle class. I propose a detailed budget, Bob. I sent up my budget man to the Congress, and he says, heres how were going to reduce the deficit in half by five years. It requires pro-growth policies that grow our economy and fiscal sanity in the halls of Congress.",2004-10-13,Republican
Schieffer,"Lets go to a new question, Mr. President. Two minutes. And lets continue on jobs. You know, there are all kind of statistics out there, but I want to bring it down to an individual.",2004-10-13,Moderator
Bush,"Id say, Bob, Ive got policies to continue to grow our economy and create the jobs of the 21st century. And heres some help for you to go get an education. Heres some help for you to go to a community college. Weve expanded trade adjustment assistance. We want to help pay for you to gain the skills necessary to fill the jobs of the 21st century. You know, theres a lot of talk about how to keep the economy growing. We talk about fiscal matters. But perhaps the best way to keep jobs here in America and to keep this economy growing is to make sure our education system works. I went to Washington to solve problems. And I saw a problem in the public education system in America. They were just shuffling too many kids through the system, year after year, grade after grade, without learning the basics. And so we said: Lets raise the standards. Were spending more money, but lets raise the standards and measure early and solve problems now, before its too late. No, education is how to help the person whos lost a job. Education is how to make sure weve got a workforce thats productive and competitive. Got four more years, Ive got more to do to continue to raise standards, to continue to reward teachers and school districts that are working, to emphasize math and science in the classrooms, to continue to expand Pell Grants to make sure that people have an opportunity to start their career with a college diploma. And so the person you talked to, I say, heres some help, heres some trade adjustment assistance money for you to go a community college in your neighborhood, a community college which is providing the skills necessary to fill the jobs of the 21st century. And thats what I would say to that person.",2004-10-13,Republican
Schieffer,Senator Kerry?,2004-10-13,Moderator
Kerry,"I want you to notice how the president switched away from jobs and started talking about education principally. Let me come back in one moment to that, but I want to speak for a second, if I can, to what the president said about fiscal responsibility. Being lectured by the president on fiscal responsibility is a little bit like Tony Soprano talking to me about law and order in this country. This president has taken a $5. 6 trillion surplus and turned it into deficits as far as the eye can see. Health-care costs for the average American have gone up 64 percent; tuitions have gone up 35 percent; gasoline prices up 30 percent; Medicare premiums went up 17 percent a few days ago; prescription drugs are up 12 percent a year. But guess what, America? The wages of Americans have gone down. The jobs that are being created in Arizona right now are paying about $13,700 less than the jobs that were losing. And the president just walks on by this problem. The fact is that hes cut job-training money. $1 billion was cut. They only added a little bit back this year because its an election year. Theyve cut the Pell Grants and the Perkins loans to help kids be able to go to college. Theyve cut the training money. Theyve wound up not even extending unemployment benefits and not even extending health care to those people who are unemployed. Im going to do those things, because thats whats right in America: Help workers to transition in every respect.",2004-10-13,Democrat
Schieffer,"New question to you, Senator Kerry, two minutes. And its still on jobs. You know, many experts say that a president really doesnt have much control over jobs. For example, if someone invents a machine that does the work of five people, thats progress. Thats not the presidents fault.",2004-10-13,Moderator
Kerry,"I dont blame them entirely for it. I blame the president for the things the president could do that has an impact on it. Outsourcing is going to happen. Ive acknowledged that in union halls across the country. Ive had shop stewards stand up and say, Will you promise me youre going to stop all this outsourcing? And Ive looked them in the eye and Ive said, No, I cant do that. What I can promise you is that I will make the playing field as fair as possible, that I will, for instance, make certain that with respect to the tax system that you as a worker in America are not subsidizing the loss of your job. Today, if youre an American business, you actually get a benefit for going overseas. You get to defer your taxes. So if youre looking at a competitive world, you say to yourself, Hey, I do better overseas than I do here in America. Thats not smart. I dont want American workers subsidizing the loss of their own job. And when Im president, were going to shut that loophole in a nanosecond and were going to use that money to lower corporate tax rates in America for all corporations, 5 percent. And were going to have a manufacturing jobs credit and a job hiring credit so we actually help people be able to hire here. The second thing that we can do is provide a fair trade playing field. This president didnt stand up for Boeing when Airbus was violating international rules and subsidies. He discovered Boeing during the course of this campaign after Id been talking about it for months. The fact is that the president had an opportunity to stand up and take on China for currency manipulation. There are companies that wanted to petition the administration. They were told: Dont even bother; were not going to listen to it. The fact is that there have been markets shut to us that we havent stood up and fought for. Im going to fight for a fair trade playing field for the American worker. And I will fight for the American worker just as hard as I fight for my own job. Thats what the American worker wants. And if we do that, we can have an impact. Plus, we need fiscal discipline. Restore fiscal discipline, well do a lot better.",2004-10-13,Democrat
Schieffer,Mr. President?,2004-10-13,Moderator
Bush,"Whew! Let me start with the Pell Grants. In his last litany of misstatements. He said we cut Pell Grants. Weve increased Pell Grants by a million students. Thats a fact. You know, he talks to the workers. Let me talk to the workers. Youve got more money in your pocket as a result of the tax relief we passed and he opposed. If you have a child, you got a $1,000 child credit. Thats money in your pocket. If youre married, we reduced the marriage penalty. The code ought to encourage marriage, not discourage marriage. We created a 10 percent bracket to help lower-income Americans. A family of four making $40,000 received about $1,700 in tax relief. Its your money. The way my opponent talks, he said, Were going to spend the governments money. No, were spending your money. And when you have more money in your pocket, youre able to better afford things you want. I believe the role of government is to stand side by side with our citizens to help them realize their dreams, not tell citizens how to live their lives. My opponent talks about fiscal sanity. His record in the United States Senate does not match his rhetoric. He voted to increase taxes 98 times and to bust the budget 277 times.",2004-10-13,Republican
Schieffer,Senator Kerry?,2004-10-13,Moderator
Kerry,"Bob, anybody can play with these votes. Everybody knows that. I have supported or voted for tax cuts over 600 times. I broke with my party in order to balance the budget, and Ronald Reagan signed into law the tax cut that we voted for. I voted for IRA tax cuts. I voted for small-business tax cuts. But you know why the Pell Grants have gone up in their numbers? Because more people qualify for them because they dont have money. But theyre not getting the $5,100 the president promised them. Theyre getting less money. We have more people who qualify. Thats not what we want.",2004-10-13,Democrat
Bush,"Senator, no ones playing with your votes. You voted to increase taxes 98 times. When they voted  when they proposed reducing taxes, you voted against it 126 times. He voted to violate the budget cap 277 times. You know, theres a main stream in American politics and you sit right on the far left bank. As a matter of fact, your record is such that Ted Kennedy, your colleague, is the conservative senator from Massachusetts.",2004-10-13,Republican
Schieffer,"Mr. President, lets get back to economic issues. But lets shift to some other questions here.",2004-10-13,Moderator
Bush,"You know, Bob, I dont know. I just dont know. I do know that we have a choice to make in America and that is to treat people with tolerance and respect and dignity. Its important that we do that. And I also know in a free society people, consenting adults can live the way they want to live. And thats to be honored. But as we respect someones rights, and as we profess tolerance, we shouldnt change  or have to change  our basic views on the sanctity of marriage. I believe in the sanctity of marriage. I think its very important that we protect marriage as an institution, between a man and a woman. I proposed a constitutional amendment. The reason I did so was because I was worried that activist judges are actually defining the definition of marriage, and the surest way to protect marriage between a man and woman is to amend the Constitution. It has also the benefit of allowing citizens to participate in the process. After all, when you amend the Constitution, state legislatures must participate in the ratification of the Constitution. Im deeply concerned that judges are making those decisions and not the citizenry of the United States. You know, Congress passed a law called DOMA, the Defense of Marriage Act. My opponent was against it. It basically protected states from the action of one state to another. It also defined marriage as between a man and woman. But Im concerned that that will get overturned. And if it gets overturned, then well end up with marriage being defined by courts, and I dont think thats in our nations interests.",2004-10-13,Republican

Kerry,"Were all Gods children, Bob. And I think if you were to talk to Dick Cheneys daughter, who is a lesbian, she would tell you that shes being who she was, shes being who she was born as. I think if you talk to anybody, its not choice. Ive met people who struggled with this for years, people who were in a marriage because they were living a sort of convention, and they struggled with it. And Ive met wives who are supportive of their husbands or vice versa when they finally sort of broke out and allowed themselves to live who they were, who they felt God had made them. I think we have to respect that. The president and I share the belief that marriage is between a man and a woman. I believe that. I believe marriage is between a man and a woman. But I also believe that because we are the United States of America, were a country with a great, unbelievable Constitution, with rights that we afford people, that you cant discriminate in the workplace. You cant discriminate in the rights that you afford people. You cant disallow someone the right to visit their partner in a hospital. You have to allow people to transfer property, which is why Im for partnership rights and so forth. Now, with respect to DOMA and the marriage laws, the states have always been able to manage those laws. And theyre proving today, every state, that they can manage them adequately.",2004-10-13,Democrat
Schieffer,"Senator Kerry, a new question for you. The New York Times reports that some Catholic archbishops are telling their church members that it would be a sin to vote for a candidate like you because you support a womans right to choose an abortion and unlimited stem-cell research.",2004-10-13,Moderator
Kerry,"I respect their views. I completely respect their views. I am a Catholic. And I grew up learning how to respect those views. But I disagree with them, as do many. I believe that I cant legislate or transfer to another American citizen my article of faith. What is an article of faith for me is not something that I can legislate on somebody who doesnt share that article of faith. I believe that choice is a womans choice. Its between a woman, God and her doctor. And thats why I support that. Now, I will not allow somebody to come in and change Roe v. Wade. The president has never said whether or not he would do that. But we know from the people hes tried to appoint to the court he wants to. I will not. I will defend the right of Roe v. Wade. Now, with respect to religion, you know, as I said, I grew up a Catholic. I was an altar boy. I know that throughout my life this has made a difference to me. And as President Kennedy said when he ran for president, he said, Im not running to be a Catholic president. Im running to be a president who happens to be Catholic. My faith affects everything that I do, in truth. Theres a great passage of the Bible that says, What does it mean, my brother, to say you have faith if there are no deeds? Faith without works is dead. And I think that everything you do in public life has to be guided by your faith, affected by your faith, but without transferring it in any official way to other people. Thats why I fight against poverty. Thats why I fight to clean up the environment and protect this earth. Thats why I fight for equality and justice. All of those things come out of that fundamental teaching and belief of faith. But I know this, that President Kennedy in his inaugural address told all of us that here on Earth, Gods work must truly be our own. And thats what we have to  I think thats the test of public service.",2004-10-13,Democrat

Bush,"I think its important to promote a culture of life. I think a hospitable society is a society where every being counts and every person matters. I believe the ideal world is one in which every child is protected in law and welcomed to life. I understand theres great differences on this issue of abortion, but I believe reasonable people can come together and put good law in place that will help reduce the number of abortions. Take, for example, the ban on partial birth abortion. Its a brutal practice. People from both political parties came together in the halls of Congress and voted overwhelmingly to ban that practice. It made a lot of sense. My opponent, in that hes out of the mainstream, voted against that law. What Im saying is, is that as we promote life and promote a culture of life, surely there are ways we can work together to reduce the number of abortions: continue to promote adoption laws  its a great alternative to abortion  continue to fund and promote maternity group homes; I will continue to promote abstinence programs. The last debate, my opponent said his wife was involved with those programs. Thats great. I appreciate that very much. All of us ought to be involved with programs that provide a viable alternative to abortion.",2004-10-13,Republican
Schieffer,"Mr. President, lets have a new question. It goes to you. And lets get back to economic issues. Health insurance costs have risen over 36 percent over the last four years according to The Washington Post. Were paying more. Were getting less.",2004-10-13,Moderator
Bush,"Gosh, I sure hope its not the administration. Theres a  no, look, theres a systemic problem. Health-care costs are on the rise because the consumers are not involved in the decision-making process. Most health-care costs are covered by third parties. And therefore, the actual user of health care is not the purchaser of health care. And theres no market forces involved with health care. Its one of the reasons Im a strong believer in what they call health savings accounts. These are accounts that allow somebody to buy a low-premium, high-deductible catastrophic plan and couple it with tax-free savings. Businesses can contribute, employees can contribute on a contractual basis. But this is a way to make sure people are actually involved with the decision-making process on health care. Secondly, I do believe the lawsuits  I dont believe, I know  that the lawsuits are causing health-care costs to rise in America. Thats why Im such a strong believer in medical liability reform. In the last debate, my opponent said those lawsuits only caused the cost to go up by 1 percent. Well, he didnt include the defensive practice of medicine that costs the federal government some $28 billion a year and costs our society between $60 billion and $100 billion a year. Thirdly, one of the reasons why theres still high cost in medicine is because this is  they dont use any information technology. Its like if you looked at the  its the equivalent of the buggy and horse days, compared to other industries here in America. And so, weve got to introduce high technology into health care. Were beginning to do it. Were changing the language. We want there to be electronic medical records to cut down on error, as well as reduce cost. People tell me that when the health-care field is fully integrated with information technology, itll wring some 20 percent of the cost out of the system. And finally, moving generic drugs to the market quicker. And so, those are four ways to help control the costs in health care.",2004-10-13,Republican
Schieffer,Senator Kerry?,2004-10-13,Moderator
Kerry,"The reason health-care costs are getting higher, one of the principal reasons is that this administration has stood in the way of common-sense efforts that would have reduced the costs. Let me give you a prime example. In the Senate we passed the right of Americans to import drugs from Canada. But the president and his friends took it out in the House, and now you dont have that right. The president blocked you from the right to have less expensive drugs from Canada. We also wanted Medicare to be able to negotiate bulk purchasing. The VA does that. The VA provides lower-cost drugs to our veterans. We could have done that in Medicare. Medicare is paid for by the American taxpayer. Medicare belongs to you. Medicare is for seniors, who many of them are on fixed income, to lift them out of poverty. But rather than help you, the taxpayer, have lower cost, rather than help seniors have less expensive drugs, the president made it illegal  illegal  for Medicare to actually go out and bargain for lower prices.",2004-10-13,Democrat

He introduced some 300 bills and hes passed five. No record of leadership. I came to Washington to solve problems.

Ive actually passed 56 individual bills that Ive personally written and, in addition to that, and not always under my name, there is amendments on certain bills. But more importantly, with respect to the question of no record, I helped write  I did write, I was one of the original authors of the early childhood health care and the expansion of health care that we did in the middle of the 1990s. And Im very proud of that. So the presidents wrong.",2004-10-13,Democrat
Schieffer,"Let me direct the next question to you, Senator Kerry, and again, lets stay on health care. You have, as you have proposed and as the president has commented on tonight, proposed a massive plan to extend health-care coverage to children. Youre also talking about the government picking up a big part of the catastrophic bills that people get at the hospital. And you have said that you can pay for this by rolling back the presidents tax cut on the upper 2 percent. You heard the president say earlier tonight that its going to cost a whole lot more money than that.",2004-10-13,Moderator
Kerry,"Well, two leading national news networks have both said the presidents characterization of my health-care plan is incorrect. One called it fiction. The other called it untrue. The fact is that my health-care plan, America, is very simple. It gives you the choice. I dont force you to do anything. Its not a government plan. The government doesnt require you to do anything. You choose your doctor. You choose your plan. If you dont want to take the offer of the plan that I want to put forward, you dont have do. You can keep what you have today, keep a high deductible, keep high premiums, keep a high co-pay, keep low benefits. But I got a better plan. And I dont think a lot of people are going to want to keep what they have today. Heres what I do: We take over Medicaid children from the states so that every child in America is covered. And in exchange, if the states want to  theyre not forced to, they can choose to  they cover individuals up to 300 percent of poverty. Its their choice. I think theyll choose it, because its a net plus of $5 billion to them. We allow you  if you choose to, you dont have to  but we give you broader competition to allow you to buy into the same health care plan that senators and congressmen give themselves. If its good enough for us, its good enough for every American. I believe that your health care is just as important as any politician in Washington, D. C. You want to buy into it, you can. We give you broader competition. That helps lower prices. In addition to that, were going to allow people 55 to 64 to buy into Medicare early. And most importantly, we give small business a 50 percent tax credit so that after we lower the costs of health care, they also get, whether theyre self-employed or a small business, a lower cost to be able to cover their employees. Now, what happens is when you begin to get people covered like that  for instance in diabetes, if you diagnose diabetes early, you could save $50 billion in the health care system of America by avoiding surgery and dialysis. It works. And Im going to offer it to America.",2004-10-13,Democrat

Bush,"In all due respect, Im not so sure its credible to quote leading news organizations about  oh, never mind. Anyway, let me quote the Lewin report. The Lewin report is a group of folks who are not politically affiliated. They analyzed the senators plan. It cost $1.2 trillion. The Lewin report accurately noted that there are going to be 20 million people, over 20 million people added to government-controlled health care. It would be the largest increase in government health care ever. Its estimated that 8 million people will go from private insurance to government insurance. We have a fundamental difference of opinion. I think government- run health will lead to poor-quality health, will lead to rationing, will lead to less choice. Once a health-care program ends up in a line item in the federal government budget, it leads to more controls. And just look at other countries that have tried to have federally controlled health care. They have poor-quality health care. Our health-care system is the envy of the world because we believe in making sure that the decisions are made by doctors and patients, not by officials in the nations capital.",2004-10-13,Republican
Schieffer,Senator?,2004-10-13,Moderator
Kerry,"The president just said that government-run health care results in poor quality. Now, maybe that explains why he hasnt fully funded the VA and the VA hospital is having trouble and veterans are complaining. Maybe that explains why Medicare patients are complaining about being pushed off of Medicare. He doesnt adequately fund it. But let me just say to America: I am not proposing a government-run program. Thats not what I have. I have Blue Cross/Blue Shield. Senators and congressmen have a wide choice. Americans ought to have it too.",2004-10-13,Democrat

Bush,"Talk about the VA: Weve increased VA funding by $22 billion in the four years since Ive been president. Thats twice the amount that my predecessor increased VA funding. Of course were meeting our obligation to our veterans, and the veterans know that. Were expanding veterans health care throughout the country. Were aligning facilities where the veterans live now. Veterans are getting very good health care under my administration, and they will continue to do so during the next four years.",2004-10-13,Republican
Schieffer,"Mr. President, the next question is to you. We all know that Social Security is running out of money, and it has to be fixed. You have proposed to fix it by letting people put some of the money collected to pay benefits into private savings accounts. But the critics are saying thats going to mean finding $1 trillion over the next 10 years to continue paying benefits as those accounts are being set up.",2004-10-13,Moderator
Bush,"First, let me make sure that every senior listening today understands that when were talking about reforming Social Security, that theyll still get their checks. I remember the 2000 campaign, people said if George W. gets elected, your check will be taken away. Well, people got their checks, and theyll continue to get their checks. There is a problem for our youngsters, a real problem. And if we dont act today, the problem will be valued in the trillions. And so I think we need to think differently. Well honor our commitment to our seniors. But for our children and our grandchildren, we need to have a different strategy. And recognizing that, I called together a group of our fellow citizens to study the issue. It was a committee chaired by the late Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, a Democrat. And they came up with a variety of ideas for people to look at. I believe that younger workers ought to be allowed to take some of their own money and put it in a personal savings account, because I understand that they need to get better rates of return than the rates of return being given in the current Social Security trust. And the compounding rate of interest effect will make it more likely that the Social Security system is solvent for our children and our grandchildren. I will work with Republicans and Democrats. Itll be a vital issue in my second term. It is an issue that I am willing to take on, and so Ill bring Republicans and Democrats together. And were of course going to have to consider the costs. But I want to warn my fellow citizens: The cost of doing nothing, the cost of saying the current system is OK, far exceeds the costs of trying to make sure we save the system for our children.",2004-10-13,Republican
Schieffer,Senator Kerry?,2004-10-13,Moderator
Kerry,"You just heard the president say that young people ought to be able to take money out of Social Security and put it in their own accounts. Now, my fellow Americans, thats an invitation to disaster. The CBO said very clearly that if you were to adopt the presidents plan, there would be a $2 trillion hole in Social Security, because todays workers pay in to the system for todays retirees. And the CBO said  thats the Congressional Budget Office; its bipartisan  they said that there would have to be a cut in benefits of 25 percent to 40 percent. Hes already got $3 trillion, according to The Washington Post, of expenses that hes put on the line from his convention and the promises of this campaign, none of which are paid for. Not one of them are paid for. The fact is that the president is driving the largest deficits in American history. Hes broken the pay-as-you-go rules. I have a record of fighting for fiscal responsibility. In 1985, I was one of the first Democrats  broke with my party. We balanced the budget in the 90s. We paid down the debt for two years. And thats what were going to do. Were going to protect Social Security. I will not privatize it. I will not cut the benefits. And were going to be fiscally responsible. And we will take care of Social Security.",2004-10-13,Democrat
Schieffer,"Let me just stay on Social Security with a new question for Senator Kerry, because, Senator Kerry, you have just said you will not cut benefits. Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, says theres no way that Social Security can pay retirees what we have promised them unless we recalibrate.",2004-10-13,Moderator
Kerry,"Not at all. Absolutely not, Bob. This is the same thing we heard  remember, I appeared on Meet the Press with Tim Russert in 1990-something. We heard the same thing. We fixed it. In fact, we put together a $5. 6 trillion surplus in the 90s that was for the purpose of saving Social Security. If you take the tax cut that the president of the United States has given  President Bush gave to Americans in the top 1 percent of America  just that tax cut that went to the top 1 percent of America would have saved Social Security until the year 2075. The president decided to give it to the wealthiest Americans in a tax cut. Now, Alan Greenspan, who I think has done a terrific job in monetary policy, supports the presidents tax cut. I dont. I support it for the middle class, not that part of it that goes to people earning more than $200,000 a year. And when I roll it back and we invest in the things that I have talked about to move our economy, were going to grow sufficiently, it would begin to cut the deficit in half, and we get back to where we were at the end of the 1990s when we balanced the budget and paid down the debt of this country. Now, we can do that. Now, if later on after a period of time we find that Social Security is in trouble, well pull together the top experts of the country. Well do exactly what we did in the 1990s. And well make whatever adjustment is necessary. But the first and most important thing is to start creating jobs in America. The jobs the president is creating pay $9,000 less than the jobs that were losing. And this is the first president in 72 years to preside over an economy in America that has lost jobs, 1. 6 million jobs. Eleven other presidents  six Democrats and five Republicans  had wars, had recessions, had great difficulties; none of them lost jobs the way this president has. I have a plan to put America back to work. And if were fiscally responsible and put America back to work, were going to fix Social Security.",2004-10-13,Democrat
Schieffer,Mr. President?,2004-10-13,Moderator
Bush,"He forgot to tell you he voted to tax Social Security benefits more than one time. I didnt hear any plan to fix Social Security. I heard more of the same. He talks about middle-class tax cuts. Thats exactly where the tax cuts went. Most of the tax cuts went to low- and middle-income Americans. And now the tax code is more fair. Twenty percent of the upper-income people pay about 80 percent of the taxes in America today because of how we structured the tax cuts. People listening out there know the benefits of the tax cuts we passed. If you have a child, you got tax relief. If youre married, you got tax relief. If you pay any tax at all, you got tax relief. All of which was opposed by my opponent. And the tax relief was important to spur consumption and investment to get us out of this recession. People need to remember: Six months prior to my arrival, the stock market started to go down. And it was one of the largest declines in our history. And then we had a recession and we got attacked, which cost us 1 million jobs. But we acted. I led the Congress. We passed tax relief. And now this economy is growing. We added 1. 9 million new jobs over the last 13 months. Sure, theres more work to do. But the way to make sure our economy grows is not to raise taxes on small-business owners. Its not to increase the scope of the federal government. Its to make sure we have fiscal sanity and keep taxes low.",2004-10-13,Republican
Schieffer,"Lets go to a new question, Mr. President. I got more e-mail this week on this question than any other question. And it is about immigration. Im told that at least 8,000 people cross our borders illegally every day. Some people believe this is a security issue, as you know. Some believe its an economic issue. Some see it as a human-rights issue.",2004-10-13,Moderator
Bush,"I see it as a serious problem. I see it as a security issue, I see it as an economic issue, and I see it as a human-rights issue. Were increasing the border security of the United States. Weve got 1,000 more Border Patrol agents on the southern border. Were using new equipment. Were using unmanned vehicles to spot people coming across. And well continue to do so over the next four years. Its a subject Im very familiar with. After all, I was a border governor for a while. Many people are coming to this country for economic reasons. Theyre coming here to work. If you can make 50 cents in the heart of Mexico, for example, or make $5 here in America, $5. 15, youre going to come here if youre worth your salt, if you want to put food on the table for your families. And thats whats happening. And so in order to take pressure off the borders, in order to make the borders more secure, I believe there ought to be a temporary worker card that allows a willing worker and a willing employer to mate up, so long as theres not an American willing to do that job, to join up in order to be able to fulfill the employers needs. That has the benefit of making sure our employers arent breaking the law as they try to fill their workforce needs. It makes sure that the people coming across the border are humanely treated, that theyre not kept in the shadows of our society, that theyre able to go back and forth to see their families. See, the card, itll have a period of time attached to it. It also means it takes pressure off the border. If somebody is coming here to work with a card, it means theyre not going to have to sneak across the border. It means our border patrol will be more likely to be able to focus on doing their job. Now, its very important for our citizens to also know that I dont believe we ought to have amnesty. I dont think we ought to reward illegal behavior. There are plenty of people standing in line to become a citizen. And we ought not to crowd these people ahead of them in line. If they want to become a citizen, they can stand in line, too. And here is where my opponent and I differ. In September 2003, he supported amnesty for illegal aliens.",2004-10-13,Republican
Schieffer,Times up.,2004-10-13,Moderator
Kerry,"Let me just answer one part of the last question quickly, and then Ill come to immigration. The American middle-class family isnt making it right now, Bob. And what the president said about the tax cuts has been wiped out by the increase in health care, the increase in gasoline, the increase in tuitions, the increase in prescription drugs. The fact is, the take-home pay of a typical American family as a share of national income is lower than its been since 1929. And the take-home pay of the richest . 1 percent of Americans is the highest its been since 1928. Under President Bush, the middle class has seen their tax burden go up and the wealthiests tax burden has gone down. Now thats wrong. Now, with respect to immigration reform, the president broke his promise on immigration reform. He said he would reform it. Four years later he is now promising another plan. Heres what Ill do: Number one, the borders are more leaking today than they were before 9/11. The fact is, we havent done what we need to do to toughen up our borders, and I will. Secondly, we need a guest-worker program, but if its all we have, its not going to solve the problem. The second thing we need is to crack down on illegal hiring. Its against the law in the United States to hire people illegally, and we ought to be enforcing that law properly.",2004-10-13,Democrat
Bush,"Well, to say that the borders are not as protected as they were prior to September the 11th shows he doesnt know the borders. Theyre much better protected today than they were when I was the governor of Texas. We have much more manpower and much more equipment there. He just doesnt understand how the borders work, evidently, to say that. That is an outrageous claim. And well continue to protect our borders.

We can know who the people are, that theyre really the people they say they are when they cross the border. We could speed it up. There are huge delays. The fact is our borders are not as secure as they ought to be, and Ill make them secure.",2004-10-13,Democrat
Schieffer,"Next question to you, Senator Kerry.",2004-10-13,Moderator
Kerry,"Well, Im glad you raised that question. Its long overdue time to raise the minimum wage. And, America, this is one of those issues that separates the president and myself. We have fought to try to raise the minimum wage in the last years. But the Republican leadership of the House and Senate wont even let us have a vote on it. Were not allowed to vote on it. They dont want to raise the minimum wage. The minimum wage is the lowest minimum wage value it has been in our nation in 50 years. If we raise the minimum wage, which I will do over several years to $7 an hour, 9. 2 million women who are trying to raise their families would earn another $3,800 a year. The president has denied 9. 2 million women $3,800 a year, but he doesnt hesitate to fight for $136,000 to a millionaire. One percent of America got $89 billion last year in a tax cut, but people working hard, playing by the rules, trying to take care of their kids, family values, that were supposed to value so much in America  Im tired of politicians who talk about family values and dont value families. What we need to do is raise the minimum wage. We also need to hold on to equal pay. Women work for 76 cents on the dollar for the same work that men do. Thats not right in America. And we had an initiative that we were working on to raise womens pay. Theyve cut it off. Theyve stopped it. They dont enforce these kinds of things. Now, I think that its a matter of fundamental right that if we raise the minimum wage, 15 million Americans would be positively affected. Wed put money into the hands of people who work hard, who obey the rules, who play for the American dream. And if we did that, wed have more consumption ability in America, which is what we need right now in order to kick our economy into gear. I will fight tooth and nail to pass the minimum wage.",2004-10-13,Democrat
Bush,"Actually, Mitch McConnell had a minimum-wage plan that I supported that would have increased the minimum wage. But let me talk about whats really important for the worker youre referring to. And thats to make sure the education system works. Its to make sure we raise standards. Listen, the No Child Left Behind Act is really a jobs act when you think about it. The No Child Left Behind Act says, Well raise standards. Well increase federal spending. But in return for extra spending, we now want people to measure  states and local jurisdictions to measure to show us whether or not a child can read or write or add and subtract. You cannot solve a problem unless you diagnose the problem. And we werent diagnosing problems. And therefore just kids were being shuffled through the school. And guess who would get shuffled through? Children whose parents wouldnt speak English as a first language just move through. Many inner-city kids just move through. Weve stopped that practice now by measuring early. And when we find a problem, we spend extra money to correct it. I remember a lady in Houston, Texas, told me, Reading is the new civil right, and shes right. In order to make sure people have jobs for the 21st century, weve got to get it right in the education system, and were beginning to close a minority achievement gap now. You see, well never be able to compete in the 21st century unless we have an education system that doesnt quit on children, an education system that raises standards, an education that makes sure theres excellence in every classroom.",2004-10-13,Republican

Im not going to appoint a judge to the Court whos going to undo a constitutional right, whether its the First Amendment, or the Fifth Amendment, or some other right thats given under our courts today  under the Constitution. And I believe that the right of choice is a constitutional right. So I dont intend to see it undone. Clearly, the president wants to leave in ambivalence or intends to undo it. But let me go a step further. We have a long distance yet to travel in terms of fairness in America. I dont know how you can govern in this country when you look at New York City and you see that 50 percent of the black males there are unemployed, when you see 40 percent of Hispanic children  of black children in some cities  dropping out of high school. And yet the president who talks about No Child Left Behind refused to fully fund  by $28 billion  that particular program so you can make a difference in the lives of those young people. Now right here in Arizona, that difference would have been $131 million to the state of Arizona to help its kids be able to have better education and to lift the property tax burden from its citizens. The president reneged on his promise to fund No Child Left Behind. Hell tell you hes raised the money, and he has. But he didnt put in what he promised, and that makes a difference in the lives of our children.",2004-10-13,Democrat

Bush,"Two things. One, he clearly has a litmus test for his judges, which I disagree with. And secondly, only a liberal senator from Massachusetts would say that a 49 percent increase in funding for education was not enough. Weve increased funds. But more importantly, weve reformed the system to make sure that we solve problems early, before theyre too late. He talked about the unemployed. Absolutely weve got to make sure they get educated. He talked about children whose parents dont speak English as a first language? Absolutely weve got to make sure they get educated.

Schieffer,"All right, lets go to another question. And it is to Senator Kerry. You have two minutes, sir. Senator, the last debate, President Bush said he did not favor a draft. You agreed with him. But our National Guard and Reserve forces are being severely strained because many of them are being held beyond their enlistments. Some of them say that its a back-door draft.",2004-10-13,Moderator
Kerry,"Well, I think the fact that theyre facing these repeated call-ups, some of them two and three deployments, and theres a stop- loss policy that prevents people from being able to get out when their time was up, is a reflection of the bad judgment this president exercised in how he has engaged in the world and deployed our forces. Our military is overextended. Nine out of 10 active-duty Army divisions are either in Iraq, going to Iraq or have come back from Iraq. One way or the other, theyre wrapped up in it. Now, Ive proposed adding two active-duty divisions to the armed forces of the United States  one combat, one support. In addition, Im going to double the number of Special Forces so that we can fight a more effective war on terror, with less pressure on the National Guard and Reserve. And what I would like to do is see the National Guard and Reserve be deployed differently here in our own country. Theres much we can do with them with respect to homeland security. We ought to be doing that. And that would relieve an enormous amount of pressure. But the most important thing to relieve the pressure on all of the armed forces is frankly to run a foreign policy that recognizes that America is strongest when we are working with real alliances, when we are sharing the burdens of the world by working through our statesmanship at the highest levels and our diplomacy to bring other nations to our side. Ive said it before, I say it again: I believe the president broke faith with the American people in the way that he took this nation to war. He said he would work through a real alliance. He said in Cincinnati we would plan carefully, we would take every precaution. Well, we didnt. And the result is our forces today are overextended. The fact is that he did not choose to go to war as a last result. And America now is paying, already $120 billion, up to $200 billion before were finished and much more probably. And that is the result of this president taking his eye off of Osama bin Laden.",2004-10-13,Democrat

I remember going on an airplane in Bangor, Maine, to say thanks to the reservists and Guard that were headed overseas from Tennessee and North Carolina, Georgia. Some of them had been there before. The people I talked to their spirits were high. They didnt view their service as a back-door draft. They viewed their service as an opportunity to serve their country. My opponent, the senator, talks about foreign policy. In our first debate he proposed America pass a global test. In order to defend ourselves, wed have to get international approval. Thats one of the major differences we have about defending our country. Ill work with allies. Ill work with friends. Well continue to build strong coalitions.

I believe law-abiding citizens ought to be able to own a gun. I believe in background checks at gun shows or anywhere to make sure that guns dont get in the hands of people that shouldnt have them. But the best way to protect our citizens from guns is to prosecute those who commit crimes with guns. And thats why early in my administration I called the attorney general and the U. S. attorneys and said: Put together a task force all around the country to prosecute those who commit crimes with guns. And the prosecutions are up by about 68 percent  I believe  is the number. Neighborhoods are safer when we crack down on people who commit crimes with guns. To me, thats the best way to secure America.",2004-10-13,Republican

And I respect the Second Amendment and I will not tamper with the Second Amendment. But Ill tell you this. Im also a former law enforcement officer. I ran one of the largest district attorneys offices in America, one of the ten largest. I put people behind bars for the rest of their life. Ive broken up organized crime. I know something about prosecuting. And most of the law enforcement agencies in America wanted that assault weapons ban. They dont want to go into a drug bust and be facing an AK-47. I was hunting in Iowa last year with a sheriff from one of the counties there, and he pointed to a house in back of us, and said, See the house over? We just did a drug bust a week earlier, and the guy we arrested had an AK-47 lying on the bed right beside him. Because of the presidents decision today, law enforcement officers will walk into a place that will be more dangerous. Terrorists can now come into America and go to a gun show and, without even a background check, buy an assault weapon today. And thats what Osama bin Ladens handbook said, because we captured it in Afghanistan. It encouraged them to do it. So I believe Americas less safe. If Tom DeLay or someone in the House said to me, Sorry, we dont have the votes, Id have said, Then were going to have a fight.

We used to  you know, we have a goal there for minority set-aside programs, to try to encourage ownership in the country. They dont reach those goals. They dont even fight to reach those goals. Theyve tried to undo them. The fact is that in too many parts of our country, we still have discrimination. And affirmative action is not just something that applies to people of color. Some people have a mistaken view of it in America. It also is with respect to women, its with respect to other efforts to try to reach out and be inclusive in our country. I think that we have a long way to go, regrettably. If you look at whats happened  weve made progress, I want to say that at the same time. During the Clinton years, as you may recall, there was a fight over affirmative action. And there were many people, like myself, who opposed quotas, who felt there were places where it was overreaching. So we had a policy called Mend it, dont end it. We fixed it. And we fixed it for a reason: because there are too many people still in this country who feel the stark resistance of racism, and so we have a distance to travel. As president, I will make certain we travel it. Now, let me just share something. This president is the first president ever, I think, not to meet with the NAACP. This is a president who hasnt met with the Black Congressional Caucus. This is a president who has not met with the civil rights leadership of our country. If a president doesnt reach out and bring people in and be inclusive, then how are we going to get over those barriers? I see that as part of my job as president, and Ill make my best effort to do it.",2004-10-13,Democrat
Schieffer,Mr. President?,2004-10-13,Moderator
Bush,"Well, first of all, it is just not true that I havent met with the Black Congressional Caucus. I met with the Black Congressional Caucus at the White House. And secondly, like my opponent, I dont agree we ought to have quotas. I agree, we shouldnt have quotas. But we ought to have an aggressive effort to make sure people are educated, to make sure when they get out of high school theres Pell Grants available for them, which is what weve done. Weve expanded Pell Grants by a million students. Thats the access I believe is necessary, is to make sure every child learns to read, write, add and subtract early, to be able to build on that education by going to college so they can start their careers with a college diploma. I believe the best way to help our small businesses is not only through small-business loans, which we have increased since Ive been the president of the United States, but to unbundle government contracts so people have a chance to be able to bid and receive a contract to help get their business going. Minority ownership of businesses are up, because we created an environment for the entrepreneurial spirit to be strong. I believe part of a hopeful society is one in which somebody owns something. Today in America more minorities own a home than ever before. And thats hopeful, and thats positive.",2004-10-13,Republican
Schieffer,"Mr. President, lets go to a new question. You were asked before the invasion, or after the invasion, of Iraq if youd checked with your dad. And I believe, I dont remember the quote exactly, but I believe you said you had checked with a higher authority. First, my faith plays a lot  a big part in my life. And thats, when I was answering that question, what I was really saying to the person was that I pray a lot. And I do. And my faith is a very  its very personal. I pray for strength. I pray for wisdom. I pray for our troops in harms way. I pray for my family. I pray for my little girls. But Im mindful in a free society that people can worship if they want to or not. Youre equally an American if you choose to worship an almighty and if you choose not to. If youre a Christian, Jew or Muslim, youre equally an American. Thats the great thing about America, is the right to worship the way you see fit. Prayer and religion sustain me. I receive calmness in the storms of the presidency. I love the fact that people pray for me and my family all around the country. Somebody asked me one time, Well, how do you know? I said, I just feel it. Religion is an important part. I never want to impose my religion on anybody else. But when I make decisions, I stand on principle, and the principles are derived from who I am. I believe we ought to love our neighbor like we love ourself, as manifested in public policy through the faith-based initiative where weve unleashed the armies of compassion to help heal people who hurt. I believe that God wants everybody to be free. Thats what I believe. And thats been part of my foreign policy. In Afghanistan, I believe that the freedom there is a gift from the Almighty. And I cant tell you how encouraged I am to see freedom on the march. And so my principles that I make decisions on are a part of me, and religion is a part of me.",2004-10-13,Moderator
Schieffer,Senator Kerry?,2004-10-13,Moderator
Kerry,"Well, I respect everything that the president has said and certainly respect his faith. I think its important and I share it. I think that he just said that freedom is a gift from the Almighty. Everything is a gift from the Almighty. And as I measure the words of the Bible  and we all do; different people measure different things  the Koran, the Torah, or, you know, Native Americans who gave me a blessing the other day had their own special sense of connectedness to a higher being. And people all find their ways to express it. I was taught  I went to a church school and I was taught that the two greatest commandments are: Love the Lord, your God, with all your mind, your body and your soul, and love your neighbor as yourself. And frankly, I think we have a lot more loving of our neighbor to do in this country and on this planet. We have a separate and unequal school system in the United States of America. Theres one for the people who have, and theres one for the people who dont have. And were struggling with that today. And the president and I have a difference of opinion about how we live out our sense of our faith. I talked about it earlier when I talked about the works and faith without works being dead. I think weve got a lot more work to do. And as president, I will always respect everybodys right to practice religion as they choose  or not to practice  because thats part of America.",2004-10-13,Democrat
Schieffer,"Senator Kerry, after 9/11  and this is a new question for you  it seemed to me that the country came together as Ive never seen it come together since World War II. But some of that seems to have melted away. I think its fair to say weve become pretty polarized, perhaps because of the political season.",2004-10-13,Moderator
Kerry,"Very much so. Let me pay a compliment to the president, if I may. I think in those days after 9/11, I thought the president did a terrific job. And I really was moved, as well as impressed, by the speech that he gave to the Congress. And I think the hug Tom Daschle gave him at that moment was about as genuine a sense of there being no Democrats, no Republicans, we were all just Americans. Thats where we were. Thats not where we are today. I regret to say that the president who called himself a uniter, not a divider, is now presiding over the most divided America in the recent memory of our country. Ive never seen such ideological squabbles in the Congress of the United States. Ive never seen members of a party locked out of meetings the way theyre locked out today. We have to change that. And as president, I am committed to changing that. I dont care if the idea comes from the other side or this side. I think we have to come together and work to change it. And Ive done that. Over 20 years in the United States Senate, Ive worked with John McCain, whos sitting here, Ive worked with other colleagues. Ive reached across the aisle. Ive tried to find the common ground, because thats what makes us strong as Americans. And if Americans trust me with the presidency, I can pledge to you, we will have the most significant effort, openly  not secret meetings in the White House with special interests, not ideologically driven efforts to push people aside  but a genuine effort to try to restore Americas hope and possibilities by bringing people together. And one of the ways were going to do it is, Im going to work with my friend, John McCain, to further campaign finance reform so we get these incredible amounts of money out of the system and open it up to average people, so America is really represented by the people who make up America.",2004-10-13,Democrat

Bush,"My biggest disappointment in Washington is how partisan the town is. I had a record of working with Republicans and Democrats as the governor of Texas, and I was hopeful Id be able to do the same thing. And we made good progress early on. The No Child Left Behind Act, incredibly enough, was good work between me and my administration and people like Senator Ted Kennedy. And we worked together with Democrats to relieve the tax burden on the middle class and all who pay taxes in order to make sure this economy continues to grow. But Washington is a tough town. And the way I view it is theres a lot of entrenched special interests there, people who are, you know, on one side of the issue or another and they spend enormous sums of money and they convince different senators to taut their way or different congressmen to talk about their issue, and they dig in. Ill continue, in the four years, to continue to try to work to do so. My opponent said this is a bitterly divided time. Pretty divided in the 2000 election. So in other words, its pretty divided during the 1990s as well. Were just in a period  weve got to work to bring it  my opponent keeps mentioning John McCain, and Im glad he did. John McCain is for me for president because he understands I have the right view in winning the war on terror and that my plan will succeed in Iraq. And my opponent has got a plan of retreat and defeat in Iraq.",2004-10-13,Republican
Schieffer,"Weve come, gentlemen, to our last question. And it occurred to me as I came to this debate tonight that the three of us share something. All three of us are surrounded by very strong women. Were all married to strong women. Each of us have two daughters that make us very proud.",2004-10-13,Moderator
Bush,"To listen to them. To stand up straight and not scowl. I love the strong women around me. I cant tell you how much I love my wife and our daughters. I am  you know its really interesting. I tell the people on the campaign trail, when I asked Laura to marry me, she said, Fine, just so long as I never have to give a speech. I said, OK, youve got a deal. Fortunately, she didnt hold me to that deal. And shes out campaigning along with our girls. And she speaks English a lot better than I do. I think people understand what shes saying. But they see a compassionate, strong, great first lady in Laura Bush. I cant tell you how lucky I am. When I met her in the backyard at Joe and Jan ONeills in Midland, Texas, it was the classic backyard barbecue. ONeill said, Come on over. I think youll find somebody who might interest you. So I said all right. Bopped over there. There was only four of us there. And not only did she interest me, I guess you would say it was love at first sight.",2004-10-13,Republican
Schieffer,Senator Kerry?,2004-10-13,Moderator
Kerry,"Well, I guess the president and you and I are three examples of lucky people who married up. And some would say maybe me more so than others. But I can take it. Can I say, if I could just say a word about a woman that you didnt ask about, but my mom passed away a couple years ago, just before I was deciding to run. And she was in the hospital, and I went in to talk to her and tell her what I was thinking of doing. And she looked at me from her hospital bed and she just looked at me and she said, Remember: integrity, integrity, integrity. Those are the three words that she left me with. And my daughters and my wife are people who just are filled with that sense of whats right, whats wrong. They also kick me around. They keep me honest. They dont let me get away with anything. I can sometimes take myself too seriously. They surely dont let me do that. And Im blessed, as I think the president is blessed, as I said last time. Ive watched him with the first lady, who I admire a great deal, and his daughters. Hes a great father. And I think were both very lucky.",2004-10-13,Democrat

Kerry,"My fellow Americans, as you heard from Bob Schieffer a moment ago, America is being tested by division. More than ever, we need to be united as a country. And, like Franklin Roosevelt, I dont care whether an idea is a Republican idea or a Democrat idea. I just care whether it works for America and whether its going to make us stronger. These are dangerous times. I believe I offer tested, strong leadership that can calm the waters of the troubled world. And I believe that we can together do things that are within the grasp of Americans. We can lift our schools up. We can create jobs that pay more than the jobs were losing overseas. We can have health care for all Americans. We can further the cause of equality in our nation. Let me just make it clear: I will never allow any country to have a veto over our security. Just as I fought for our country as a young man, with the same passion I will fight to defend this nation that I love. And, with faith in God and with conviction in the mission of America, I believe that we can reach higher. I believe we can do better. I think the greatest possibilities of our country, our dreams and our hopes, are out there just waiting for us to grab onto them. And I ask you to embark on that journey with me. I ask you for your trust. I ask you for your help. I ask you to allow me the privilege of leading this great nation of ours, of helping us to be stronger here at home and to be respected again in the world and, most of all, to be safer forever.

Bush,"In the Oval Office, theres a painting by a friend of Laura and mine named  by Tom Lee. And its a West Texas painting, a painting of a mountain scene. And he said this about it. He said, Sarah and I live on the east side of the mountain. Its the sunrise side, not the sunset side. Its the side to see the day that is coming, not to see the day that is gone. I love the optimism in that painting, because thats how I feel about America. And weve been through a lot together during the last 3 3/4 years. Weve come through a recession, a stock market decline, an attack on our country. And yet, because of the hard work of the American people and good policies, this economy is growing. Over the next four years, well make sure the economy continues to grow. We reformed our school system, and now theres an achievement gap in America thats beginning to close. Over the next four years, well continue to insist on excellence in every classroom in America so that our children have a chance to realize the great promise of America. Over the next four years, well continue to work to make sure health care is available and affordable. Over the next four years, well continue to rally the armies of compassion, to help heal the hurt that exists in some of our countrys neighborhoods. Im optimistic that well win the war on terror, but I understand it requires firm resolve and clear purpose. We must never waver in the face of this enemy that  these ideologues of hate. And as we pursue the enemy wherever it exists, well also spread freedom and liberty. We got great faith in the ability of liberty to transform societies, to convert a hostile world to a peaceful world. My hope for America is a prosperous America, a hopeful America and a safer world.

Its being held here in the Theater for the Arts on the campus of Georgia Tech. Im Hal Bruno from ABC News and Im going to be moderating tonights debate. The participants are Republican Vice President Dan Quayle. Democratic Senator Al Gore. for independent candidate Ross Perot. Now, the ground rules for tonights debate. Each candidate will have 2 minutes for an opening statement. I will then present the issues to be discussed. For each topic, the candidates will have a minute and 15 seconds to respond. Then this will be followed by a 5 minute discussion period in which they can ask questions of each other if they so choose. Now, the order of response has been determined by a drawing and well rotate with each topic. At the end of the debate, each candidate will have 2 minutes for a closing statement. Our radio and TV audience should know that the candidates were given an equal allocation of auditorium seats for their supporters. So Id like to ask the audience here in the theater to please refrain from applause or any partisan demonstration once the debate is under way because it takes time away from the candidates. So with that plea from your moderator lets get started. And well turn first to Senator Gore for his opening statement.",1992-10-13,Moderator
Senator Gore,"Good evening. Its great to be here in Atlanta for this debate where America will be showcased to the world when the 1996 Olympics are put on right here. Its appropriate because in a real sense, our discussion this evening will be about what kind of nation we want to be 4 years from now. Its also a pleasure to be with my 2 opponents this evening. Admiral Stockdale, may I say its a special honor to share this stage with you. Those of us who served in Vietnam looked at you as a national hero even before you were awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor. And Mr. Vice President  Dan, if I may  it was 16 years ago that you and I went to the Congress on the very first day together. Ill make you a deal this evening. If you dont try to compare George Bush to Harry Truman, I wont compare you to Jack Kennedy.",1992-10-13,Democrat
Gore,"Harry Truman, its worth remembering, assumed the presidency when Franklin Roosevelt died here in Georgia  only one of many occasions when fate thrust a vice president into the Oval Office in a time of crisis. Its something to think about during the debate this evening. But our real discussion is going to be about change. Bill Clinton and I stand for change because we dont believe our nation can stand 4 more years of what weve had under George Bush and Dan Quayle. When the recession came they were like a deer caught in the headlights  paralyzed into inaction, blinded to the suffering and pain of bankruptcies and people who were unemployed. We have an environmental crisis, a health insurance crisis, substandard education. It is time for a change. Bill Clinton and I want to get our country moving forward again, put our people back to work, and create a bright future for the US of America.",1992-10-13,Democrat
Bruno,"Okay, the next statement will be from Vice President Quayle.",1992-10-13,Moderator
Quayle,"Well, thank you, Senator Gore, for reminding me about my performance in the 1988 vice presidential debate. This is 1992, Bill Clinton is running against President George Bush. There are 2 things that Im going to stress during this debate: one, Bill Clintons economic plan and his agenda will make matters much, much worse  he will raise your taxes, he will increase spending, he will make government bigger, jobs will be lost; second, Bill Clinton does not have the strength nor the character to be president of the US. Let us look at the agendas. President Bush wants to hold the line on taxes, Bill Clinton wants to raise taxes. President Bush is for a balanced budget amendment, Bill Clinton is opposed to it. We want to reform the legal system because its too costly, Bill Clinton wants the status quo. We want to reform the health care system, Bill Clinton wants to ration health care. Bill Clinton wants to empower government, we want to empower people. In St. Louis, Missouri, in June of this year, Bill Clinton said this: America is the mockery of the world. He is wrong. At some time during these next 4 years there is going to be a crisis  there will be an international crisis. I cant tell you where its going to be, I cant even tell you the circumstances  but it will happen. We need a president who has the experience, who has been tested, who has the integrity and qualifications to handle the crisis. The president has been tested, the president has the integrity and the character. The choice is yours.",1992-10-13,Republican

Admiral Stockdale,"Who am I? Why am I here? Im not a politician  everybody knows that. So dont expect me to use the language of the Washington insider. Thirty-seven years in the Navy, and only one of them up there in Washington. And now Im an academic. The centerpiece of my life was the Vietnam War. I was there the day it started. I led the first bombing raid against North Vietnam. I was there the day it ended, and I was there for everything in between. Ten years in Vietnam, aerial combat, and torture. I know things about the Vietnam War better than anybody in the world. I know some things about the Vietnam War better than anybody in the world. And I know how governments, how American governments can be  can be courageous, and how they can be callow. And thats important. Thats one thing Im an insider on. I was the leader of the underground of the American pilots who were shot down in prison in North Vietnam. You should know that the American character displayed in those dungeons by those fine men was a thing of beauty. I look back on those years as the beginning of wisdom, learning everything a man can learn about the vulnerabilities and the strengths that are ours as Americans. Why am I here tonight? I am here because I have in my brain and in my heart what it takes to lead America through tough times.",1992-10-13,Independent
Bruno,"Thank you, Admiral. I thought since youre running for vice president, that we ought to start off by talking about the vice presidency itself. The vice president presides over the Senate, he casts a deciding vote in case of a tie, but his role really depends on the assignments that are given to him by the president. However, if a president should die in office, or is unable to serve for any other reason, the vice president automatically becomes president, and that has happened 5 times in this century. So the proposition I put on the table for you to discuss is this. In the case of Vice President Quayle, who were starting with, I suppose youd tell us the role that you did play in the first term and which youd like to do in a 2nd term. Go ahead, sir.",1992-10-13,Moderator
Quayle,"Well, then I wont give you that answer. Qualifications. Ive been there, Hal. Ive done the job. Ive been tested. Ive been vice president for 4 years. Senator Gore referred to us being elected to the Congress together in 1976. Ive done the job. Ive done many things for the president. But even as vice president you never know exactly what your role is going to be from time to time, and let me just give you an example of where I was tested under fire and in a crisis. President Bush was flying to Malta in 1989 to meet with President Gorbachev. It was the first meeting between President Bush and President Gorbachev. They had known each other before. A coup broke out in the Philippines. I had to go to the situation room. I had to assemble the presidents advisers. I talked to President Aquino. I made the recommendation to the president. The president made the decision, the coup was suppressed, democracy continued in the Philippines, the situation was ended. Ive been there. And Ill tell you one other thing that qualifies you for being president  and its this, Hal  youve got to stand up for what you believe in. And nobody has ever criticized me for not having strong beliefs.",1992-10-13,Republican

If were successful in our efforts to gain your trust and lead this nation, we will work together to put our country back on the right track again. The experience that George Bush and Dan Quayle have been talking about includes the worst economic performance since the Great Depression. Unemployment is up, personal income is down, bankruptcies are up, housing starts are down. How long can we continue with trickle-down economics when the record of failure is so abundantly clear? Discussions of the vice presidency tend sometimes to focus on the crisis during which a vice president is thrust into the Oval Office, and indeed, one-3rd of the vice presidents who have served have been moved into the White House. But the teamwork and partnership beforehand  and hopefully that situation never happens  how you work together is critically important. The way we work together in this campaign is one sample.",1992-10-13,Democrat

Quayle,"The answer to that is very simple: we are not going to raise taxes to create new jobs, we have a plan to create new jobs. But that wasnt the question. The question dealt with qualifications. Teamwork and partnership may be fine in the Congress, Senator Gore  thats what Congress is all about, compromise, teamwork, working things out. But when youre president of the US or when youre vice president and you have to fill in like I did the night of the crisis in the Philippines, youve got to make a decision, youve got to make up your mind. Bill Clinton, running for president of the US, said this about the Persian Gulf war. He said: Had I been in the Senate, I would have voted with the majority, if it was a close vote. But I agreed with the arguments of the minority. and sit there and say, well, on the one hand, this is okay, and, on the other hand, this is okay. Youve got to make the decision.

Gore," trickle-down economics for 12 years now, and you all still support trickle-down to the very last drop. And, you know, talking about this point of concentrating on every other country in the world as opposed to the people of our country right here at home, when George Bush took former Secretary of State Baker out of the State Dept and put him in charge of the campaign and made him chief of staff in the White, Mr. Baker, whos quite a capable man, said that for these last 4 years George Bush was working on the problems of the rest of the world and in the next 4 years he would target America. Well, I want you to know we really appreciate that. But Bill Clinton and I will target America from day one. We wont wait 4 years before we concentrate on the problems in this country. He went on to say that its really amazing what George Bush can do when he concentrates. Well, its time that we had a president like Bill Clinton who can concentrate and will concentrate and work on the problems of real people in this country. You know, our country is in trouble. We simply cannot continue with this philosophy of giving huge tax cuts to the very wealthy, raising taxes on middle income families the way Bush and Quayle have done and then waiting for it to work.

Specifically the economy was talked about at great length the other night in the presidential debate. Lets talk about a very particular aspect of the economy and that is, getting people back to work. For the average person, the great fear is losing his or her job and many Americans have lost jobs in this recession, which also means the loss of benefits, the loss of a home, the destruction of a familys security. Specifically, how would your administration go about getting people back to work and how long is it going to take? And we start with Admiral Stockdale.",1992-10-13,Moderator
Stockdale,"The lifeblood of our economy is investment. And right now when we pay $350  we borrow $350 billion a year it saps the money markets and the private investors are not getting their share. What we do is work on that budget by an aggressive program, not a painful program, so that we can start borrowing less money and getting more investment money on the street through entrepreneurs who can build factories, who will hire people, and maybe well start manufacturing goods here in this country again.

Bill Clinton has created high-wage manufacturing jobs at 10 times the national average and in fact according to the statistics coming from the Bush-Quayle Labor Dept, for the last 2 years in a role Bill Clintons state has been number one among all 50 in the creation of jobs in the private sector. By contrast, in the nation as a whole, during the last 4 years, it is the first time since the presidency of Herbert Hoover, that we have gone for a 4-year period with fewer jobs at the end of that 4-year period than we had at the beginning. And look at manufacturing. We have lost 1.4 million jobs in manufacturing under George Bush and Dan Quayle. They have even  we learned 2 weeks ago  taken our tax dollars and subsidized the moving of US factories to foreign countries.

Gore,"Well, the difference between the Perot- Stockdale plan and the Clinton-Gore plan is that Ross Perots plan concentrates almost exclusively on balancing the budget and reducing the budget deficit, and the danger is that if that is the only goal it could throw our nation back into an even worse recession. Bill Clinton and I have a detailed 5-year budget plan to create good jobs, cut the budget deficit in half, and eliminate the investment deficit in order to get our economy moving forward again. We have a $20-billion infrastructure fund to create a nationwide network of high-speed rail, for example, and what are called information superhighways to open up a whole universe of knowledge for our young people and to help our universities and companies that rely on new advances in the information revolution. We also have tax incentives for investment in job-creating activities, not the kind of encouragement for short-term rip-offs like the proposal that we have had from George Bush. But I want to return and say one more time: you have used our tax dollars to subsidize the recruitment of US companies to move overseas and throw Americans out of work. In Decaturville, Tennessee, not very far from my home, a factory was shut down right there when they were solicited by officials paid with US taxpayers money, and then the replacement workers in a foreign country were trained with our tax dollars and then their imports were subsidized coming back into the US.",1992-10-13,Democrat

Of course American businesses do have business abroad; weve got global competition. We want businesses to expand.

Im sure what you didnt talk to them about was about how were going to reform the health care system, like the president wants to do. He wants to go out and to reform the health care system so that every American will have available to them affordable health insurance. Im sure one other thing that you didnt talk to them about, Senator, and that is legal reform, because your position on legal reform is the status quo. And yet you talk about foreign competition. Why should an American company have to spend 15 to 20 times on product liability and insurance costs compared to a company in Japan or a company in Germany or somewhere else? Thats not right. We have product liability reform legislation on Capitol Hill. It will create jobs. And a Democratic Congress wont pass it.",1992-10-13,Republican
Bruno,"Okay. I think its time to move on to our next topic. All 3 of you gentlemen have some expertise in defense and the armed forces. Vice President Quayle and Senator Gore both served on the Senate Armed Services Committee. Admiral Stockdale, of course, has a very distinguished military career. With the end of the Cold War, everyone agrees that there are going to be major cuts. Theyve already started in the defense budget. But this country has a long history of neglecting its military needs in peace time and then paying for it with heavy casualties when were caught unprepared. How much of a defense cut is safe? What happens to the people who are forced to leave the military services, or if they lose their jobs because theyre working in defense industries. I think we start with Senator Gore this time.",1992-10-13,Moderator
Gore,"Bill Clinton and I support a strong national defense. He and I have both fought for change within the Democratic Party as well as within the country. In the aftermath of the Cold War, the definition of strong national defense has obviously changed somewhat. For example, George Bush wants to maintain at least 150,000 American soldiers in Europe, even though World War II ended 50 years ago. Bill Clinton and I agree with so many military experts who believe that it is time for the Europeans, who are so much wealthier now and more powerful than they were at the end of World War II to start picking up a little more of that tab themselves and not rely so exclusively on the US taxpayers for the defense of Europe. We believe that we can make savings in our defense budget and at the same time, improve our national security. Now, for those who are affected by the cutbacks, whether they come from George Bush or Bill Clinton and me  the difference is, Bill Clinton and I have a defense conversion program so that those who won the Cold War will not be left out in the cold. We want to put them to work, building an infrastructure and an economy here in this country for the 90s and the next century.",1992-10-13,Democrat

Yes, we can make the cuts in defense and we have. Bill Clinton wants to cut defense another $60 billion. Id say to the defense workers in California and elsewhere, a $60 billion defense cut is going to cut a lot of jobs out. Yes, we are making a conversion and we can go to a civil space rather than having defense  or the defense industry. Well, let me say this: we would not have won the Cold War if we had listened to Senator Gore and his crowd, and had supported a nuclear freeze. If you would have supported that attitude  if you would have supported that attitude, we would not have won the Cold War.

But wed note that Mr.  Governor Clintons plan is almost twice as much a cut as either one of us. Ive been through the end of World War II, and the surprise beginning of Korea, to see how we  it cost us more money because we overcut the defense budget in the first place. I dont say that So I think that should be eyed with great suspicion, people that are really kicking the props out from under our grand military establishment prematurely. Now theres other differences between the Perot approach and what we see up here on either side of me, and that has to do with we want to focus our interests, economic and military, more to the Pacific. We figure that we are generally going along with any sort of a troop removal from Europe. So thats still another face of this puzzle.",1992-10-13,Independent

Now when I heard George Bush say at the convention in Houston, that when he heard the phrase we won the Cold War, it made him wonder who the we was. Well, I want to tell you, President Bush, the we is the people of the US of America. This wasnt a partisan victory that came suddenly, a few months after you took the oath of office. This started with Harry Truman and it was a bipartisan effort from the very beginning. George Bush taking credit for the Berlin Wall coming down is like the rooster taking credit for the sunrise. And I want to, I want to add  I want to add one other thing, because in the debate a few nights ago, I think President Bush made a very serious misstatement of fact in response to Ross Perot. It was kind of a little lecture he gave to Ross Perot when he said those SS-18s are gone, Ross, thats done. He  he reached a deal with Boris Yeltsin to completely remove them so we can all sleep safely without any fear tonight. But you know what? They thought they were going to get that deal, but when he took the person in charge of the negotiations out of the State Dept and put him in charge of the reelection campaign, the deal unraveled and now there is no START II deal at all.

And the leaders sit down and they will negotiate, and they will come to agreements with people that they trust. And this is a fundamental problem with Bill Clinton, is trust and character. It is not the issue of how he avoided military service 20-some years ago; its the fact  its the fact that he does not tell the truth about it. He first said he didnt get an induction notice, then we find out that he did; he said he didnt have an ROTC slot, then we find out he did; he said he didnt use Senator Fulbrights office for special influence, then we find out that he did. These are inconsistencies. Bill Clinton has trouble telling the truth.

Gore,"There is no such proposal. What I have called upon is a cooperative effort by the US and Europe and Asia to work together in opening up new markets throughout the world for the new technologies that are necessary in order to reconcile the imperatives of economic progress with the imperatives of environmental protection. Take Mexico City for an example. They are shutting down factories right now, not because of their economy, but because theyre choking to death on the air pollution. Theyre banning automobiles some days of the week. Now what they want is not new laser-guided missile systems. What they want are new engines and new factories and new products that dont pollute the air and the water, but nevertheless allow them to have a decent standard of living for their people. Last year 35 % of our exports went to developing countries, countries where the population is expanding worldwide by as much as one billion people every ten years. We cannot stick our heads in the sand and pretend that we dont face a global environmental crisis, nor should we assume that its going to cost jobs. Quite the contrary. We are going to be able to create jobs as Japan and Germany are planning to do right now, if we have the guts to leave. Now earlier we heard about the auto industry and the timber industry. There have been 250,000 jobs lost in the automobile industry during the Reagan-Bush-Quayle years. There have been tens of thousands of jobs lost in the timber industry.

There was a bipartisan commission evenly divided between Republicans and Democrats who looked at our plan and the Bush-Quayle proposal.

Quayle,"Hal, President Bush has had his health care reform agenda on Capitol Hill for 8 months. Hes had parts of it up there for years. You talk about increasing costs that the president has had on Capitol Hill-  medical malpractice reform legislation  for several years. Defensive medicine and health care today cost $20.7 billion. Defense medicine defined as testing and treatment that is only necessary in case of a law suit. Wouldnt that be nice to take $20.7 billion that were putting into our legal system and put it to preventive health care or womens health care or something else besides trial lawyers? But no  you dont want to reform the health care system to drive down costs through medical malpractice. What youre doing  you are talking about a government program. Your program is to ration health care. You said in your statement to see a doctor when you want to see a doctor. When you start rationing health care theres going to be a waiting line to see a doctor unless its an emergency. Remember when we rationed energy in this country? Waiting lines at the gasoline stations. The same thing would happen when you ration health care. The presidents proposal deals with tax credits, deductions and purchasing health care in the private sector and making health care affordable and available to every single American.",1992-10-13,Republican

Do you know which state has the lowest malpractice premiums in the entire country? Bill Clintons Arkansas does  partly because he has passed reform measures limiting the time during which malpractice suits can be filed. In fact, tort claims generally have fallen 10 % under Bill Clinton there. But you know, thats not the reason for this health insurance crisis. The reason is, weve had absolutely no leadership. Let me tell you about a friend of mine named Mitch Philpot from Marietta, Georgia  not far from here  who Tipper and I met with his family in Johns Hopkins Hospital. Their son, Brett, was in the bed next to our son and they couldnt pay their medical bills. They used to live in Atlanta, but they lost their house.

And the way to reduce them is by reducing the number of unwanted pregnancies, not vetoing family planning legislation the way George Bush has consistently done. The reason we are pro-choice and in favor of a womans right to privacy is because we believe that during the early stages of a pregnancy the government has no business coming in and ordering a woman to do what the government thinks is best. What Dan Quayle and George Bush and Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson think is the right decision in a given set of circumstances is their privilege  but dont have the government order a woman to do what they think is the right thing to do.

And looking back on that she said it was a mistake. She said  she said I wished at that time, that I was going through this difficult time, that I had counseling to talk about the post-abortion trauma, and talk about adoption rather than abortion.

Bruno,"Im sorry, sir. I was saying that at times this campaign has been very ugly with personal negative attacks. As a candidate, how does it look from where you are and are these tactics really necessary?",1992-10-13,Moderator
Stockdale,"Nasty attacks  well, I think there is a case to be made for putting emphasis on character over these issues that weve been batting back and forth and have a life of their own. Sure, you have to know where youre going with your government, but character is the big variable in the success. Character of the leaders is the big variable in the success  long term success  of an administration. I went to a friend of mine in New York some years ago and he was a president of a major TV network and he said, you know, I think we have messed up this whole  this election process  it was an election year  by stressing that  putting out the dogma that issues are the thing to talk about, not character. He said, I felt so strongly about this, I went back and read the Lincoln-Douglas debates. Read those debates. How do they come down? Douglas is all character. He knows all of the little stinky numbers these guys do. Abraham Lincoln had character. Thank God we got the right president in the Civil War. But that is a question that is a valid one, and you know, I would like to brag about the character of my boss.",1992-10-13,Independent
Bruno,"Okay, Senator Gore.",1992-10-13,Moderator
Gore,"This election is about the future of our country, not about personal attacks against one candidate or another. Our nation is in trouble and it is appalling to me that with 10 million Americans out work, with the rest working harder for less money than they did 4 years ago, with the loss of 1.4 million manufacturing jobs in our nation, with the health care crisis, a crisis of crime and drugs and AIDS, substandard education, that George Bush would constantly try to level personal attacks at his opponent.",1992-10-13,Democrat
Bruno,Okay. Vice President Quayle.,1992-10-13,Moderator
Quayle,Let me answer the question.,1992-10-13,Republican
Bruno,Go ahead.,1992-10-13,Moderator
Quayle,"Hal, you said  and I wrote it down here  personal negative attacks. (Laughs) Has anyone been reading my press clippings for the last 4 years? But I happen to  I agree with one thing on  with Senator Gore, and that is that we ought to look to the future, and the future is, whos going to be the next president of the US. And is it a negative attack and a personal attack to point out that Bill Clinton simply has trouble telling the truth? He said that he didnt even demonstrate  he told the people in Arkansas in 1978. Then we find out he organized demonstrations. You know, I dont care whether he demonstrated or didnt demonstrate. The fact  the question is, tell the truth. Just tell us the truth. Today, Bill Clinton  excuse me  yesterday in Philadelphia on a radio show, just yesterday on a radio show, he attacked  Admiral, he attacks Ross Perot saying the media is giving Ross Perot a free ride. The press asked him when the klieg lights are on, said what do you mean by Ross Perot getting a free ride? He says I didnt say that at all. I mean, you cant have it both ways. No, I dont think that is a personal attack. What I find troubling with Bill Clinton is he cant tell the truth. You cannot lead this great country of ours by misleading the people.",1992-10-13,Republican
Bruno,"All right, gentlemen, the control room advises me that in order to have time for your closing statements, which we certainly want, there simply is not going to be time for a discussion period on this particular topic. So lets go to the closing statements. You have 2 minutes each. And well start with Admiral Stockdale.",1992-10-13,Moderator
Stockdale,"I think the best justification for getting Ross Perot in the race again to stay is that were seeing this kind of chit-chat back and forth about issues that dont concentrate on where our grandchildren  the living standards of our children and grandchildren. He is, as I have read in more than one article, a revolutionary; hes got plans out there that are going to double the speed at which this budget problem is being cared for. It was asked how, if we would squeeze down so fast that we would strangle the economy in the process. That is an art, to follow all those variables and know when to let up and to nurse this economy back together with pulls and pushes. And theres no better man in the world to do that than that old artist, Ross Perot. And so I think that my closing statement is that I think Im in a room with people that arent the life of reality. The US is in deep trouble. Weve got to have somebody that can get up there and bring out the firehoses and get it stopped, and thats what were about in the Perot campaign.",1992-10-13,Independent
Bruno,"Thank you. Senator Gore, your closing statement, sir.",1992-10-13,Moderator
Gore,"Three weeks from today, our nation will make a fateful decision. We can continue traveling the road we have been on, which has led to higher unemployment and worse economic times, or we can reach out for change. If we choose change, it will require us to reach down inside ourselves to find the courage to take a new direction. Sometimes it seems deceptively easy to continue with the old habits even when theyre no longer good for us. Trickle-down economics simply does not work. We have had an increase in all of the things that should be decreasing. Everything that should have been increasing has been going down. We have got to change direction. Bill Clinton offers a new approach. He has been named by the other 49 governors, Republicans and Democrats alike, as the best and most effective governor in the entire US of America. Hes moved 17,000 people off the welfare rolls and on to payrolls. He has introduced innovations in health care and education, and again, he has led the nation for the last 2 years in a row in the creation of jobs in the private sector. We simply cannot stand to continue with this failed approach that is no good for us. Ultimately, it is a choice between hope and fear, a choice between the future and the past. It is time to reach out for a better nation. We are bigger than George Bush has told us we are, as a nation, and we have a much brighter future. Give us a chance. With your help, well change this country and we cant wait to get started.",1992-10-13,Democrat
Bruno,Vice President Quayle.,1992-10-13,Moderator
Quayle,"Thank you, Hal. Id like to use this closing statement to talk to you about a few people that I have met in these last 4 years. I think of a woman in Chicago when I was talking to parents about education where she stood up and said Im sick and tired of these schools in this city being nothing but a factory for failure. And thats why we support choice in education. I was in Beaumont, Texas, and met with small business people, and they wanted to reform the civil justice system because they think our legal system costs too much and theres too much of a delay in getting an answer. I was in Middletown, Ohio, talking to a welfare woman, where she said I want to go back to work and I had a job offered to me but Im not going to take it because I have 2 children at home and the job that is offered to me doesnt have health insurance. Under President Bushs health care reform package that woman wont have to make a choice about going back to work or health care for her children, because shell have both. I was in Vilnius, Lithuania, Independence Square, speaking to 10,000 people in the middle of winter. Hundreds of people came up to me and said: God bless America. Yes, in the next 4 years, as I said, somewhere, some time, theres going to be a crisis, and you need to have a president that is qualified, has the experience, and has been tested. Not one time during this evening, during 90 minutes, did Al Gore tell us why Bill Clinton is qualified to be president. He never answered my charges that Bill Clinton has trouble telling the truth.",1992-10-13,Republican
Bruno,"That concludes this vice presidential debate. Id like to thank Vice President Quayle, Senator Gore, Admiral Stockdale for being participants.

Shaw,"On behalf of the Commission on Presidential Debates, I am pleased to welcome you to the second presidential debate. I am Bernard Shaw of CNN, Cable News Network. My colleagues on the panel are Ann Compton of ABC NEWS; Margaret Warner of Newsweek magazine; and Andrea Mitchell of NBC NEWS. The candidates are Vice President George Bush, the Republican nominee; and Governor Michael Dukakis, the Democratic nominee. (Applause)",1988-10-13,Moderator
Shaw,"For the next 90 minutes we will be questioning the candidates following a format designed and agreed to by representatives of the two campaigns. However, there are no restrictions on the questions that my colleagues and I can ask this evening, and the candidates have no prior knowledge of our questions. By agreement between the candidates, the first question goes to Gov. Dukakis. You have two minutes to respond. Governor, if Kitty Dukakis were raped and murdered, would you favor an irrevocable death penalty for the killer?",1988-10-13,Moderator
Dukakis,"No, I dont, Bernard. And I think you know that Ive opposed the death penalty during all of my life. I dont see any evidence that its a deterrent, and I think there are better and more effective ways to deal with violent crime. Weve done so in my own state. And its one of the reasons why we have had the biggest drop in crime of any industrial state in America; why we have the lowest murder rate of any industrial state in America. But we have work to do in this nation. We have work to do to fight a real war, not a phony war, against drugs. And thats something I want to lead, something we havent had over the course of the past many years, even though the Vice President has been at least allegedly in charge of that war. We have much to do to step up that war, to double the number of drug enforcement agents, to fight both here and abroad, to work with our neighbors in this hemisphere. And I want to call a hemispheric summit just as soon after the 20th of January as possible to fight that war. But we also have to deal with drug education prevention here at home. And thats one of the things that I hope I can lead personally as the President of the United States. Weve had great success in my own state. And weve reached out to young people and their families and been able to help them by beginning drug education and prevention in the early elementary grades. So we can fight this war, and we can win this war. And we can do so in a way that marshals our forces, that provides real support for state and local law enforcement officers who have not been getting that support, and do it in a way which will bring down violence in this nation, will help our youngsters to stay away from drugs, will stop this avalanche of drugs thats pouring into the country, and will make it possible for our kids and our families to grow up in safe and secure and decent neighborhoods.",1988-10-13,Democrat
Shaw,"Mr. Vice President, your one-minute rebuttal.",1988-10-13,Moderator
Bush,"Well, a lot of what this campaign is about, it seems to me Bernie, goes to the question of values. And here I do have, on this particular question, a big difference with my opponent. You see, I do believe that some crimes are so heinous, so brutal, so outrageous, and Id say particularly those that result in the death of a police officer, for those real brutal crimes, I do believe in the death penalty, and I think it is a deterrent, and I believe we need it. And Im glad that the Congress moved on this drug bill and have finally called for that related to these narcotics drug kingpins. And so we just have an honest difference of opinion: I support it and he doesnt.",1988-10-13,Republican
Shaw,"Now to you, Vice President Bush. I quote to you this from Article III of the 20th amendment to the Constitution.

Shaw,"automatically automatically, Dan Quayle would become the 41st President of the United States. What have you to say about that possibility?",1988-10-13,Moderator
Bush,"Id have confidence in him. And I made a good selection. And Ive never seen such a pounding, an unfair pounding, on a young Senator in my entire life. And Ive never seen a presidential campaign where the presidential nominee runs against my vice presidential nominee; never seen one before. (Applause)",1988-10-13,Republican
Bush,"But you know, Lloyd Bentsen jumped on Dan Quayle, when Dan Quayle said, hes had roughly the same amount of experience. He had two terms in the Congress. He had two terms in the Senate, serving his second term. He founded authored, the job training partnership act. It says to American working men and women that are thrown out of work for no fault of their own that theyre going to have jobs. Were moving into a new competitive age, and we need that kind of thing. He, unlike my opponent, is an expert in national defense; helped amend the INF treaty so we got a good, sound treaty, when these people over here were talking about a freeze. If wed listened to them, we would never have had a treaty. And so I have great confidence in him. And its turning around. You know, the American people are fair. They dont like it when theres an unfair pounding and kind of hooting about people. They want to judge it on the record itself. And so Im proud of my choice. And you know, I dont think age is the only criterion. But Ill tell you something, Im proud that people who are 30 years old and 40 years old now have someone in their generation that is going to be vice president of the United States of America. I made a good selection. The American people are seeing it, and Im proud of it; thats what Id say. And he could do the job.",1988-10-13,Republican

Dukakis,"Bernard, this was the first presidential decision that we as nominees were called upon to make. And thats why people are so concerned. Because it was an opportunity for us to demonstrate what we were looking for in a running mate. More than that, it was the first national security decision that we had to make. The Vice President talks about national security. Three times since World War II, the Vice President has had to suddenly become the President and commander in chief. I picked Lloyd Bentsen, because I thought he was the best qualified person for the job. (Applause) GOY.",1988-10-13,Democrat

Shaw,Ann Compton for the Vice President.,1988-10-13,Moderator
Compton,"Thank you, Bernie. Mr. Vice President, yes, we read your lips: no new taxes. But despite that same pledge from President Reagan, after income tax rates were cut, in each of the last five years, some Federal taxes have gone up, on Social Security, cigarettes, liquor, even long distance telephone calls. Now thats money straight out of peoples wallets. Isnt the phrase, no new taxes, misleading the voters?",1988-10-13,Moderator
Bush,"No, because Im pledged to that, and yes, some taxes have gone up. And the main point is, taxes have been cut, and yet income is up to the Federal Government by 25 percent in the last three years. And so what I want to do is keep this expansion going. I dont want to kill it off by a tax increase. More Americans at work today than at any time in the history of the country, and a greater percentage of the work force. And the way you kill expansions is to raise taxes. And I dont want to do that, and I wont do that. And what I have proposed is something much better. And its going to take discipline of the executive branch; its going to take discipline of the congressional branch. And that is what I call a flexible freeze that allows growth about 4 percent or the rate of inflation but does not permit the Congress just to add on spending. I hear this talk about a blank check. The American people are pretty smart: they know who writes out the checks. And they know who appropriates the money. It is the United States Congress. And by two to one, Congress is blamed for these deficits. And the answer is to discipline both the executive branch and the congressional branch by holding the line on taxes. So Im pledged to do that. And those pessimists who say it cant be done, Im sorry, I just have a fundamental disagreement with them",1988-10-13,Republican
Shaw,"Gov. Dukakis, your one-minute response.",1988-10-13,Moderator
Dukakis,"Ann, the Vice President made that pledge. Hes broken it three times in the past year already. So it isnt worth the paper its printed on. And what Im concerned about is that if we continue with the policies that Mr. Bush is talking about here this evening, the flexible freeze somebody described it the other day as a kind of economic slurpee he wants to spend billions on virtually every weapons system around. He says hes not going to raise taxes, though he has broken that pledge repeatedly. He says he wants to give the wealthiest one percent of the people in this country a five-year $40 billion tax break, and were going to pay for it. And hes been proposing all kinds of programs for new spending costing billions. Now if we continue with these policies, this trillion and a half dollars worth of new debt thats already been added on the backs of the American taxpayer is going to increase even more, and if we continue with this for another four years, then Im worried about the next generation, whether we can ever turn this situation around. No, we need a chief executive who is prepared to lead; who wont blame the Congress; who will lead to bring down that deficit, who will make tough choices on spending",1988-10-13,Democrat
Shaw,Governor,1988-10-13,Moderator
Dukakis,will go out and do the job that we expect of him and do it with the Congress of the United States. (Applause),1988-10-13,Democrat
Shaw,And to Governor Dukakis.,1988-10-13,Moderator
Compton,"Governor, let me follow up on that by asking you youve said it many times that you have balanced ten budgets in a row in Massachusetts. Are you promising the American people here tonight that within a four-year presidential term, you will balance the federal budget?",1988-10-13,Moderator
Dukakis,"No, Im not sure I can promise that; I dont think either one of us can really. There is no way of anticipating what may happen. I will say this: that we will set as our goal a steady, gradual reduction of the deficit, which will require tough choices on spending; it will require a good strong rate of economic growth; it will require a plan that the president works out with the Congress doesnt blame them, works it out with them, which brings that deficit down; it will require us to go out and collect billions and billions of dollars in taxes owed that arent being paid in this country. And thats grossly unfair to the average American who is paying his taxes and paying them on time and doesnt have any alternative: its taken out of his paycheck. Mr. Bush says we are going to put the IRS on every taxpayer. Thats not what we are going to do. Im for the taxpayer bill of rights. But I think its unconscionable, Ann, that we should be talking or thinking about imposing new taxes on average Americans when there are billions out there, over $100 billion, in taxes owed that arent being paid. Now, I think if we work together on it, and if you have a president that will work with the Congress and the American people, we can bring that deficit down steadily, $20, $25, $30 billion a year, build economic growth, build a good strong future for America, invest in those things which we must invest in economic development, good jobs, good schools for our kids, college opportunity for young people, decent health care and affordable housing, and a clean and safe environment. We can do all of those things, and at the same time build a future in which we are standing on a good strong fiscal foundation. Senator Bentsen said, as you recall at the debate with Senator Quayle, that if you give any of us $200 billion worth of hot checks a year, we can create an illusion of prosperity. But sooner or later that credit card mentality isnt going to work. And I want to bring to the White House a sense of strength and fiscal responsibility which will build a good strong foundation under which this country, or above which country can move, grow, invest, and build the best America for its people and for our kids and our grandkids.",1988-10-13,Democrat
Shaw,"Mr. Vice President, your response.",1988-10-13,Moderator
Bush,"The Governor has to balance the budget in his state he is required to by law. He has raised taxes several times. I wish he would join me, as a matter of fact, in appealing to the American people for the balanced budget amendment for the federal government and for the line-item veto. (Applause) Id like to have that line-item veto for the president, because I think that would be extraordinarily helpful. And I wont do one other thing that hes had to do: took $29 million out of his state pension fund thats equivalent at the federal level of taking out of the Social Security trust fund. Im not going to do that; I wont do that. (Applause) And so Im still a little unclear as to whether hes for or against the tax increase. I have been for the taxpayer bill of rights all along. And this idea of unleashing a whole bunch-an army, a conventional force army, of IRS agents into everybodys kitchen I mean, hes against most defense matters, and now he wants to get an army of JRS auditors going out there. (Laughter) Im against that; I oppose that. (Boos and applause)",1988-10-13,Republican
Shaw,"Im going to say this and Im going to say it once to every person in this auditorium: what these candidates are about is of utmost seriousness to the American voters; they should be heard and you should be quiet.

Warner,Youll get your turn.,1988-10-13,Moderator
Dukakis,I dont know if the vice president agrees with that.,1988-10-13,Democrat
Warner,"The American public admired your performance, but didnt seem to like you much. Now, Ronald Reagan has found his personal warmth to be a tremendous political asset. Do you think that a president has to be likable to be an effective leader?",1988-10-13,Moderator
Dukakis,"Margaret, may I go back and just say to the vice president that I didnt raid the pension fund of Massachusetts you are dead wrong, George, we didnt do that. As a matter of fact, Im the first governor in the history of my state to fund that pension system, and Im very proud of that. (Applause) I have been in politics for twenty-five years, Margaret; Ive won a lot of elections, Ive lost a few, as you know, and learned from those losses. I won the Democratic nomination in fifty-one separate contests. I think Im a reasonably likable guy. (Laughter, scattered applause) Im serious though I think Im a little more lovable these days than I used to be back in my youth when I began in my state legislature. But Im also a serious guy. I think the presidency of the United States is a very serious office, and I think we have to address these issues in a very serious way. So I hope and expect that I will be liked by the people of this country as president of the United States; I certainly hope I will be liked by them on the 8th of November. (Laughter) But I also think its important to be somebody who is willing to make those tough choices. Now, we have just heard two or three times from the vice president: hes not going to raise taxes. I repeat, within days after you made that pledge, you broke it; you said, well, maybe as a last resort well do it. And you supported legislation this year thats involved tax increases not once, but twice. So that pledge isnt realistic, and I think the vice president knows it; I think the people of this country know it. The fact of the matter is that the next president of the United States is going to have to go to the White House seriously, he is going to have to work with the Congress seriously he cant turn to the Congress and blame them for the fact that we dont have a balanced budget and that we have billions and billions of dollars in red ink. And I am going to be a president who is serious, I hope and expect will be liked by the American people. But more than that, to do the kind of job that Im elected to do, will do it with as much good humor as I can, but at the same time will do it in a way which will achieve the goals we want for ourselves and our people. And I think we know what they are: a good strong future, a future in which there is opportunity for all of our citizens.",1988-10-13,Democrat
Shaw,One minute from the Vice President.,1988-10-13,Moderator
Bush,"I dont think its a question of whether people like you or not to make you an effective leader. I think its whether you share the broad dreams of the American people, whether you have confidence in the peoples ability to get things done or whether you think it all should be turned over, as many of the liberals do, to Washington, D.C. You see, I think its a question of values, not likability or loveability, its a question in foreign affairs in experience, knowing world leaders, knowing how to build on a superb record of this administration in arms control, because youd know exactly how to begin. You have to learn from experience that making unilateral cuts in defense system is not the way that you enhance peace. Youve got to understand that it is only the United States that can stand for freedom and democracy around the world and we cant turn it over to the United Nations or other multilateral organizations. It is, though, trying to understand the heartbeat of the country. And I know these campaigns get knocked a lot, but I think Id be a better President now for having had to travel to these communities and understand the family values and the importance of neighborhood.

Warner,"Id like to follow up on that Mr. Vice President. The tenor of the campaign youve been running, in terms of both the issues and your rhetoric has surprised even some of your friends. Senator Mark Hatfield whos known your family a long time and who knew your father, the late Senator Prescott Bush, said, and I quote, If his father were alive today, Im sure his father would see it as a shocking transformation. Is Senator Hatfield right?",1988-10-13,Moderator
Bush,What was he referring to?,1988-10-13,Republican
Warner,He was referring to your performance in the campaign.,1988-10-13,Moderator
Bush,"I think my dad would be pretty proud of me, because I think weve come a long long way and I think, you know three months ago, I remember some of the great publications in this country had written me off. And what Ive had to do is define, not just my position, but to define his and I hope Ive done it fairly. And the reason Ive had to do that is that he ran on the left in the Democratic primary, ran firmly and ran with conviction and ran on his record. And then at that Democratic convention, they made a determination and they said there, ideology doesnt matter, just competence. And in the process the negatives began. It wasnt me that was there at that convention. Thank God I was up in the with Jimmy Baker camping out and I didnt have to hear all the personal attacks on me out of that Democratic convention. And Im not the one that compared the President of the United States rotting from like a dead fish from the head down. I didnt do that. But I have defined the issues and I am not going to let Governor Dukakis go through this election without explaining some of these very liberal position hes the one a liberal, traditional liberal a progressive liberal Democrat. Hes the one that brought up, to garner primary votes, the whole question of the ACLU. And I have enormous difference with the ACLU on their politic agenda. Not on their defending some minority opinion on the right or the left. I support that. But what I dont like is this left wing political agenda and therefore I have to help define that and if hes unwilling to do it, if he says ideology doesnt matter, I dont agree with him. (Applause)",1988-10-13,Republican
Shaw,One minute from Governor Dukakis.,1988-10-13,Moderator
Dukakis,"Well, Margaret, weve heard it again tonight and Im not surprised, the labels. I guess the Vice President two or three times, said I was coming from the left. In 1980, President Reagan called you a liberal for voting for Federal gun control. And this is something Republicans have used for a long time. They tried it with Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman and John Kennedy. Its not labels. Its our vision of America. And we have two fundamentally different visions of America. The Vice President is complacent, thinks we ought to stick with the status quo, doesnt think we ought to move ahead, thinking things are okay as they are. I dont. I think this is a great country, because weve always wanted to do better, to make our country better, to make our lives better. Weve always been a nation which was ambitious for America and we move forward. And thats the kind of America I want. Thats the kind of leadership I want to provide. But I dont think these labels mean a thing and I would hope that tonight in the course of the rest of this campaign, we can have good solid disagreements on issues. Theres nothing the matter with that. But lets stop labeling each other and lets get to the heart of the matter which is the future of this country. (Applause)",1988-10-13,Democrat
Shaw,"Andrea Mitchell, for the Vice President.",1988-10-13,Moderator
Mitchell,"Mr. Vice President, Governor. Mr. Vice President, let me return for a moment to the issue of the budget, because so much has already been put off limits in your campaign that most people do not believe that the flexible freeze alone will solve the problem of the deficit. So, lets turn to defense for a moment. Pentagon officials tell us that there is not enough money in the budget to handle military readiness, preparedness, as well as new weapons systems that have been proposed, as well as those already in the pipeline. You were asked in the first debate what new weapons systems you would cut. You mentioned three that had already been canceled. Can you tonight share with us three new weapons systems that you could?",1988-10-13,Moderator
Bush,"If I knew of three new weapons systems that I thought were purely waste and werent protected by the Congress, they wouldnt be in the budget. They would not be in the budget, but you want one now? Ill give you one, that HMET, that heavy truck, thats cost what is it $850 million and the Pentagon didnt request it and, yet, a member of Congress, a very powerful one, put it in the budget. I think we can save money through this whole very sophisticated concept, Andrea, that I know you do understand of competitive strategies. It is new and it is very very different than whats happened, but its not quite ready to be totally implemented. But its very important. I think we can say, through the Packard Commission Report and Im very proud that David Packard, the originator of that report, is strongly supporting me. So, its not a question of saying our budget is full of a lot of waste. I dont believe that. I do think this. Were in the serious stages of negotiation with the Soviet Union on the strategic arms control talks. And were protecting a couple of options in terms of modernizing our strategic forces. My Secretary of Defense is going to have to make a very difficult decision in which system to go forward with. But we are protecting both of them. We are moving forward with negotiations and, you see, I just think it would be dumb negotiating policy with the Soviets to cut out one or the other of the two options right now. The Soviets are modernizing. They continue to modernize and we cant simply weve got enough nuclear weapons, lets freeze. We cant do that. We have to have modernization, especially if we achieve the 50 percent reduction in strategic weapons that our President is taking the leadership to attain. And, so, thats the way Id reply to it and I believe we can have the strongest and best defense possible if we modernize, if we go forward with competitive strategies and if we do follow through on the Packard Commission report.",1988-10-13,Republican
Shaw,"Governor Dukakis, one minute.",1988-10-13,Moderator
Dukakis,"Well, Andrea, weve just had another example of why the Vice Presidents mathematics just dont add up. I think you know because youve covered these issues, that theres no way that we can build all of the weapons the Vice President says he wants to build within the defense budget. Everybody knows that including the people at the Pentagon. Now, my defense secretary is going to have a lot to do with those decisions, but its going to be the President whos going to have to ultimately decide before that budget goes to the Congress what weapons systems are going to go and what are going to stay. We are not going to spend the billions and trillions that Mr. Bush wants to spend on Star Wars. Were not going to spend billions on MXs on railroad cars, which is a weapons system we dont need, cant afford and wont help our defense posture at all. Were not going to spend hundreds of millions on a space plane from Washington to Tokyo. Those are decisions that the chief executive has to make. Yes, were going to have a strong and credible and effective nuclear deterrent. Were going to go forward with the Stealth and the D-5 and the advance cruise missile and good conventional forces. But the next President of the United States will have to make some tough and difficult decisions. Im prepared to make them, the Vice President is not.",1988-10-13,Democrat
Shaw,"Governor, Andrea has a question for you.",1988-10-13,Moderator
Mitchell,"Governor, continuing on that subject, then, you say we have to do something about conventional forces. You have supported the submarine launch missile, the D-5 you just referred to. Yet, from Jerry Ford to Jimmy Carter to Ronald Reagan, there has been a bipartisan consensus in favor of modernizing the land based missiles. Now, you have ruled out the MX and the Midgetman. More recently, some of your aides have hinted at some flexibility you might show about some other new form of missile. Can you tell us tonight why you have rejected the wisdom of people as diverse as Sam Nunn, Henry Kissinger, Al Gore, people in both parties and what type of land based missile would you consider?",1988-10-13,Moderator
Dukakis,"Well, Andrea, today we have 13,000 strategic nuclear warheads, on land, on air and in the sea. Thats an incredibly powerful nuclear deterrent. I dont rule out modernization, and there are discussions going on now in the Congress, I know with the Pentagon, about a less expensive modernized land-based leg of the triad. But there are limits to what we can spend. There are limits to this nations ability to finance these weapons systems. And one of the things that the Vice President either ignores or wont address is the fact that you cant divorce our military security from our economic security. How can we build a strong America militarily thats teeter-tottering on a mountain of debt? And if we go forward with the kinds of policies that the Vice President is suggesting tonight and has in the past, that debt is going to grow bigger and bigger and bigger. So military security and economic security go hand in hand. And we will have a strong and effective and credible nuclear deterrent. Were going to have conventional forces that are well maintained, well equipped, well trained, well supported. And we have serious problems with our conventional forces at the present time, and theyll get worse unless we have a president who is willing to make some of these decisions. And we also have important domestic priorities, in education and housing and health care, in economic development, in job training, in the environment. And all of these things are going to have to be addressed. Thats why I say again to all of you out there who have to deal with your household budgets and know how difficult it is that the next President has to do the same. I want the men and women of our Armed Forces to have the support they need to defend us; the support they need when they risk our lives to keep us free and to keep this country free. But we cannot continue to live on a credit card. We cannot continue to tell the American people that were going to build all of these systems, and at the same time, invest in important things here at home, and be serious about building a strong and good America. And thats the kind of America I want to build.",1988-10-13,Democrat

Bush,"I think the foremost responsibility of a president really gets down to the national security of this country. The Governor talks about limits, what we cant do, opposes these two modernization systems, talks now about well, well develop some new kind of a missile. It takes eight years, ten years, to do that. He talked about a nuclear freeze back at the time when I was in Europe trying to convince European public opinion that we ought to go forward with the deployment of the INF weapons. And thank God, the freeze people were not heard. They were wrong. And the result is, we deployed, and the Soviets kept deploying, and then we negotiated from strength. And now we have the first arms control agreement in the nuclear age to ban weapons. You just dont make unilateral cuts in the naive hope that the Soviets are going to behave themselves. World peace is important, and we have enhanced the peace. And Im proud to have been a part of an administration that has done exactly that. Peace through strength works.",1988-10-13,Republican
Shaw,Ann Compton for Gov. Dukakis.,1988-10-13,Moderator
Compton,"Governor, today they may call them role models, but they used to be called heroes, the kind of public figure who could inspire a whole generation, someone who was larger than life. My question is not, who your heroes were. My question instead is, who are the heroes who are there in American life today? Who are the ones who you would point out to young Americans as figures who should inspire this country?",1988-10-13,Moderator
Dukakis,"Well, I think when I think of heroes, I think back, not presently, Ann. But there are many people who I admire in this country today. Some of them are in public life in the Senate, the Congress. Some of my fellow governors who are real heroes to me. I think of those young athletes who represented us at the Olympics were tremendously impressive. We were proud of them. We felt strongly about them, and they did so well by us. I can think of doctors and scientists, Jonas Salk who for example discovered a vaccine which cured one of the most dread diseases we ever had. And hes a hero. I think of classroom teachers, classroom teachers that I have had, classroom teachers that youngsters have today who are real heroes to our young people. Because they inspire them. They teach them. But more than that, they are role models. Members of the clergy who have done the same. Drug counselors out there in the street who are providing help to youngsters who come up to me and others who ask for help and want help, are doing the hard work, the heroic work, which it takes to provide that kind of leadership, that kind of counseling, that kind of support. I think of people in the law enforcement community who are taking their lives in their hands everyday, when they go up to one of those doors and kick it down and try to stop this flow of drugs into our communities and into our kids. So there are many, many heroes in this country today. These are people that give of themselves everyday and every week and every month. In many cases they are people in the community who are examples, and are role models. And I would hope that one of the things I could do as president is to recognize them, to give them the kind of recognition that they need and deserve so that more and more young people can themselves become the heroes of tomorrow, can go into public service, can go into teaching, can go into drug counseling, can go into law enforcement, and be heroes themselves to generations yet to come.",1988-10-13,Democrat

I think of a young man now in this country named Villadaris, who was released from a Cuban jail. Came out and told the truth in this brilliant book, Against All Hope, about what is actually happening in Cuba. I think of those people that took us back into space again, Rick Houk and that crew, as people that are worthy of this. I agree with the Governor on athletics. And theres nothing corny about having sports heroes, young people that are clean and honorable and out there setting the pace. I think of Dr. Fauci. Probably never heard of him. You did, Ann heard of him. Hes a very fine research, top doctor, at the National Institute of Health, working hard doing something about research on this disease of AIDS. But look, I also think we ought to give a little credit to the President of the United States. He is the one who has gotten us that first arms control agreement.",1988-10-13,Republican

Dukakis and his years of public service, is there anything nice you can say about him, anything you find admirable?",1988-10-13,Moderator
Bush,Youre stealing my close. I had something very nice to say in there.,1988-10-13,Republican
Compton,Somebody leak my question to you?,1988-10-13,Moderator
Bush,"No, let me tell you something about that. And Barbara and I were sitting there before that Democratic convention. And we saw the Governor and his son on television the night before and his family, and his mother who was there. And Im saying to Barbara, you know, weve always kept family as a bit of an oasis for us. You all know me, and weve held it back a little. But we used that as a role model, the way he took understandable pride in his heritage, what his family means to him. And weve got a strong family. And we watched that. And we said, hey, weve got to unleash the Bush kids. And so you saw ten grandchildren there jumping all over their grandfather at the convention. You see our five kids, all over this country, and their spouses. And so I would say that the concept of the Dukakis family has my great respect. And I would say, I dont know whether thats kind or not, its just an objective statement. I think the man anybody that gets into this political arena and has to face you guys everyday deserves a word of praise. Because its gotten a little ugly out there. Its gotten a little nasty. Its not much fun sometimes. And I would cite again Dan Quayle. Ive been in politics a long time, and I dont remember that kind of piling on, that kind of ugly rumor that never was true, printed. Now, come on. So some of it is unfair. But hes in the arena. Teddy Roosevelt used to talk about the arena, you know, daring to fail greatly or succeed, no matter. Hes in there. So I salute these things. I salute those who participate in the political process. Sam Raybum had a great expression on this. He said here were all these intellectuals out there griping and complaining and saying it was negative coverage. Rayburn says, yeah, and that guy never ran for sheriff either. Michael Dukakis has run for sheriff, and so has George Bush.",1988-10-13,Republican

They cant live in the community which they grew up in. Those are basic American values. I believe in them. I think you believe in them. Theyre not left or right. Theyre decent American values. I guess the one thing that concerns me about this, Ann, is this attempt to label things which all of us believe in. We may have different approaches. We may think that you deal with them in different ways. But theyre basically American, I believe in them. George Bush believes in them. I think the vast majority of Americans believe in them.

Warner,"Vice President Bush, abortion remains with us as a very troubling issue, and Id like to explore that for a minute with you. You have said that you regard abortion as murder, yet you would make exceptions in the case of rape and incest. My question is, why should a woman who discovers through amniocentesis that her baby will be born with Tay-Sachs disease, for instance, that the baby will live at most two years, and those two years in incredible pain, be forced to carry the fetus to term, and yet a woman who becomes pregnant through incest would be allowed to abort her fetus?",1988-10-13,Moderator
Bush,"Because you left out one other exception, the health of the mother. Let me answer your question and I hope it doesnt get too personal or maudlin. Barb and I lost a child, you know that we lost a daughter, Robin. I was over running records in west Texas, and I got a call from her, come home; went to the doctor; the doctor said, beautiful child, your child has a few weeks to live. And I said, what can we do about it. He said, no, she has leukemia, acute leukemia, a few weeks to live. We took the child to New York. Thanks to the miraculous sacrifice of doctors and nurses, the child stayed alive for six months and then died. If that child were here today, and I was told the same thing, my granddaughter, Noel for example that child could stay alive for ten or fifteen years, or maybe for the rest of her life. And so I dont think that you make an exception based on medical knowledge at the time. I think human life is very, very precious. And, look, this hasnt been an easy decision for me to meet. I know others disagree with it. But when I was in that little church across the river from Washington and saw our grandchild christened in our faith, I was very pleased indeed that the mother had not aborted that child, and put the child up for adoption. And so I just feel this is where Im coming from. And it is personal. And I dont assail him on that issue, or others on that issue. But thats the way I, George Bush, feel about it.

But isnt the real question that we have to answer not how many exceptions we make, because the vice president himself is prepared to make exceptions. Its who makes the decision, who makes this very difficult, very wrenching decision? (Applause) And I think it has to be the woman, in the exercise of her own conscience and religious beliefs, that makes that decision. Who are we to say, well, under certain circumstances, its all right, but under other circumstances it isnt? Thats a decision that only a woman can make, after consulting her conscience and consulting her religious principles. And I would hope that we would give to women in this country the right to make that decision, and to make it in the exercise of their conscience and religious beliefs. (Applause)",1988-10-13,Democrat
Shaw,"Governor, Margaret has a question for you.",1988-10-13,Moderator

Dukakis,"And, incidentally, may I say that thats the decision of the Congress, and the president has concurred.",1988-10-13,Democrat
Warner,"Yet you are on the board of a group called Jobs with Peace, in Boston, that advocates a 25-percent cut in the defense budget and the transfer of that money to the domestic economy. My question is, do you share that goal perhaps as a long-range goal, and, if not, are you aware of or why do you permit this group to continue to use your name on its letterhead for fundraising?",1988-10-13,Moderator
Dukakis,"I think I was on the advisory committee, Margaret. No, I dont happen to share that goal. Its an example of how oftentimes we may be associated with organizations all of whose particular positions we dont support, even though we support in general the hope that over time, particularly if we can get those reductions in strategic weapons, if we can get a comprehensive test ban treaty, if we can negotiate with the Soviet Union and bring down the level of conventional forces in Europe with deeper cuts in the Soviet side, yes, at some point it may be possible to reduce defense outlays and use those for important things here at home, like jobs and job training and college opportunity and health and housing and the environment and the things that all of us care about. But I do think this, that the next president, even within a relatively stable budget and thats what we are going to have for the foreseeable future will have to make those tough choices that I was talking about and that Mr. Bush doesnt seem to want to make. And that really is going to be a challenge for the next president of the United States; I dont think theres any question about it. But I also see a tremendous opportunity now to negotiate with the Soviet Union to build on the progress that weve made with the INF Treaty, which I strongly supported and most Democrats did to get those reductions in strategic weapons, to get a test ban treaty, and to really make progress on the reduction of conventional forces in Europe. And if we can do that and do it in a way that gets deeper cuts on the Soviet side, which is where they ought to come from, then I think we have an opportunity over the long haul to begin to move some of our resources from the military to important domestic priorities that can provide college opportunity for that young woman whose mother wrote me from Texas just the other day, from Longview, Texas: two teachers, a mother and a father who have a child thats a freshman in college, an electrical engineering major, a very bright student and they cant afford to keep that child in college. So I hope that we can begin to move those resources. Its not going to happen overnight; it certainly will have to happen on a step-by-step basis as we make progress in arms negotiation and arms control and arms reduction. But it certainly ought to be the long-term goal of all Americans and I think it is.",1988-10-13,Democrat

Bush,"The defense budget today takes far less percentage of the gross national product than it did in President Kennedys time, for example moved tremendously. And you see, I think were facing a real opportunity for world peace. This is a big question. And its a question as to whether the United States will continue to lead for peace. See, I dont believe any other country can pick up the mantel. I served at the UN. I dont think we can turn over these kinds of decisions of the collective defense to the United Nations or anything else. So, what Im saying is, we are going to have to make choices. I said I would have the Secretary of Defense sit down. But while the President is negotiating with the Soviet Union, I simply do not want to make these unilateral cuts. And I think those that advocated the freeze missed the point that there was a better way and that better way has resulted in a principle asymmetrical cuts. The Soviets take out more than we do and the principle of intrusive verification. And those two principles can now be applied to conventional forces, to strategic forces, provided",1988-10-13,Republican

So, lets assume now, for argument purpose, that it is the spring of 1989 and you are President Dukakis, and you discover that all of those economists were right and you were wrong. You are now facing that dreaded last resort increase taxes. Which tax do you decide is the least onerous?",1988-10-13,Moderator

Mitchell,"For the sake of argument, no. (Applause)",1988-10-13,Moderator
Dukakis,"As a matter of reality, Fm going to have to because we have had not one but two detailed studies which indicate that there are billions and billions of dollars to be collected that are not being paid these are not taxes owed by average Americans. We dont have an alternative. Well lose it when its taken out of our paycheck before we even get it. But its the Internal Revenue Service which estimates now that we arent collecting $100 billion or more in taxes owed in this country. And that is just absolutely unfair to the vast majority of Americans who pay their taxes and pay them on time. The Dorgan Task Force, which included two internal revenue commissioners, one a Republican, one a Democrat. It was a bipartisan commission, a study by two respected economists, which indicated that we could collect some 40, 45, 50 billion dollars of those funds. The point is youve got to have a president whos prepared to do this and to begin right away and, preferably, a president who was a governor of a state thats had very, very successful experience at doing this. In my own state, we did it. In other states, weve done it. Republican governors as well as Democratic governors. And weve had great success at revenue enforcement. Now, the Vice President will probably tell you that its going to take an army of IRS collectors again. Well, his campaign manager, who used to be the secretary of the treasury, was taking great credit about a year ago and asking and receiving from the Congress substantial additional funds to hire internal revenue agents to go out and collect these funds, and Im happy to join Jim Baker in saying that we agree on this. But, the fact of the matter is that this is something that we must begin its going to take at least the first year of the new administration. But, the Dorgan Task Force, the bipartisan task force estimated that we could collect about $35 billion in the fifth year, $105 billion over five years, the other study even more than that",1988-10-13,Democrat

And I think where I differ with the Governor of Massachusetts, because I am optimistic. They jumped on me yesterday for being a little optimistic about the United States. I am optimistic and I believe we can keep this longest expansion going. I was not out there when that stock market dropped wringing my hands and saying this was the end of the world as some political leaders were, because it isnt the end of the world. And what we have to do is restrain the growth of spending. And we are doing a better job of it. The Congress is doing a better job of it. And the dynamics work.

Now, can you stand here tonight and look at a whole generation of 18 to 34 year olds in the eye the very people who are going to have to be financing that retirement and tell them that they should be financing the retirement of people like yourself, like Governor Dukakis, or for that matter, people such as ourselves here on this panel?",1988-10-13,Moderator
Bush,More so you than me.,1988-10-13,Republican
Mitchell,We could argue about that.,1988-10-13,Moderator
Bush,"No, but you got to go back to what social security was when it was created. It wasnt created as a welfare program. It wasnt created that is it was created as a whole retirement or supplement to retirement program. It wasnt created as a welfare program. So, heres whats happened. We came into office and the Social Security Trust Fund was in great jeopardy and the President took the leadership working with the Democrats and the Republicans in Congress some tough calls were made and the Social Security Trust Fund was put back into sound, solvent condition. So, I dont want to fool around with it. And there are several theres a good political reason because its just about this time of year that the Democrats start saying the Republicans are going to take away your Social Security. It always works that way. Ive seen it. In precinct politics in Texas and Ive seen it at the national level. We have made the Social Security Trust Fund sound. And it is going to be operating at surpluses and I dont want the liberal Democratic Congress to spend out of that Social Security Trust Fund or go and take the money out for some other purpose. I dont want that. And I will not go in there and suggest changes in Social Security. I learned that the hard way and the Governor and I both supported slipping the COLAs for one year. He supported it at the National Governors Conference and I supported it in breaking a tie in a major compromise package and we got assailed by the Democrats in the election over that. And I am going to keep that Social Security Trust Fund sound and keep our commitment to the elderly and maybe down the line, maybe when you get two decades or one into the next century, youre going to have to take another look at it, but not now. We do not have to do it. Keep the trust with the older men and women of this country.",1988-10-13,Republican

We won a majority, we didnt win the two-thirds that was necessary nor to pass that resolution, George. But everybody knew what we were doing and Ive opposed that. The reason that we raise concerns, not just in election years, but every year, because Republicans, once theyre elected and start cutting. You did it in 1985. The Administration tried to do it repeatedly, repeatedly in 81 82. And Im sure youll try to do it again. Because theres no way you can finance what you want to spend.

And when the Vice President talks about liberals on the Bench, I wonder who hes talking about?

But in fact, there are so many millions of Americans who are eligible the government just cant continue to pay for all of those programs as theyre currently constituted. A blue ribbon panel shortly after the election is likely to recommend that you go where the money is when you make budget cuts, and that means entitlements. Before the election would you commit yourself to any of those hard choices, such as which one of those entitlements have to be redrawn?",1988-10-13,Moderator
Dukakis,"Andrea, why do people who want balanced budgets or to bring the deficit down always go to those programs which tend to benefit people of very modest means? Now, two-thirds of the people in this country who receive Social Security checks live entirely on that check; they have no other income. And yet Mr. Bush tried to cut their cost of living increase in 1985. Medicare is not getting less expensive; medical care for the elderly is getting more expensive, with greater deductibles, with fewer benefits, the kinds of things weve had under this Administration that have cut and chopped and reduced the kind of benefits that one gets under Medicare. Yes, we now have catastrophic health insurance, but its going to cost, and thats going to be an additional burden on elderly citizens. It had bipartisan support; it should have had bipartisan support. But I suggest that we understand that those are going to be additional costs on senior citizens across this country. So Im not going to begin, and Im not going to go to entitlements as a means for cutting that deficit when were spending billions on something like Star Wars, when were spending billions on other weapon systems which apparently the Vice President wants to keep in his back pocket or some place, but which, if we continue to spend billions on them, will force us to cut Social Security, to cut Medicare, to cut these basic entitlements to people of very, very modest means. Now there are some things we can do to help people who currently do get entitlements to get off public assistance. I talked in our first debate about the possibilities of helping millions and millions of welfare families to get off of welfare, and Im proud to say that we finally have a welfare reform bill And the Ruby Samsons and Dan Lawsons, hundreds of thousands of welfare mothers in this country and in my state and across the country who today are working and earning are examples of what can happen when you provide training to those welfare mothers, some daycare for their children so that those mothers can go into a training program and get a decent job.",1988-10-13,Democrat

Shaw,One minute for the Vice President.,1988-10-13,Moderator
Bush,"I think Ive addressed it. But let me simply say for the record, I did not vote to cut COLAs. And I voted the same way that he did three months before in a national governors conference. And he said at that time, in a quote, and this is a paraphrase, a freeze, thats easy. So I dont believe that we need to do what youve suggested here. And Ive said that Im going to keep this Social Security entitlement, to keep that trust fund sound. But I do think there are flexible ways to solve some of the pressing problems, particularly that affect our children. And I have made some good sound proposals. But again, we have a big difference on child care, for example. You see, I want the families to have the choice. I dont want to see the Federal Government licensing grandmothers. I dont want to see the Federal Government saying to communities, well, you cant do this any more. Were going to tell you how to do it all. I want flexibility, and I do you know, these people laugh about the thousand points of light. You ought to go out and see around this country whats happening in the volunteer section: Americans helping America. And I want to keep it alive in child care and in other entitlements.",1988-10-13,Republican

Now it is true, as you said, that originally you sought an exemption for Social Security COLAs in this national governors association vote. But when you lost that vote, you then endorsed the overall freeze proposal. And whats more, you had great criticism of your fellow governors who wouldnt go along as political cowards.",1988-10-13,Moderator

Warner,My question is: Arent you demagoguing the Social Security issue?,1988-10-13,Moderator
Dukakis,"No, and I have to (Applause)",1988-10-13,Democrat
Dukakis,"I just have to correct the record. That simply isnt true. Now, were not a parliamentary body, the National Governors Association. We vote on resolutions. If you dont get a two-thirds, then your resolution doesnt pass. But everybody knew that those of us who voted against the freezing of COLAs did so, we did so emphatically. And I never made that statement; never would. The point is that as we look at this nations future, and we have two very different visions of this future. I want to move ahead. The Vice President talks about a thousand points of light. Im interested in 240 million points of light. Im interested in 240 million citizens in this country who share in the American dream, all of them in every part of this country. But as we look at the decisions that the next president of the United States is going to have to make, I just dont believe the place you go first is those programs, those so-called entitlements, which provide a basic floor of income and a modest amount of medical care for the elderly, the disabled, for people who cant make their way on their own, and in many cases, have given a great deal to this country. The Vice President did call Social Security a few years ago basically or largely a welfare program. It isnt. Its a contract between generations. Its something that we pay into now so that we will have a secure retirement, and our parents and grandparents will have a secure retirement. Its a very sacred contract, and I believe in it. So thats not where we ought to go. There are plenty of places to cut. Theres lots we can do in the Pentagon where dishonest contractors have been lining their pockets at the expense of the American taxpayer. There are we certainly ought to be able to",1988-10-13,Democrat

Hes been out in the state saying that, in Midwestern states. I dont. I think the farm bill that he criticizes was good legislation, outstanding legislation. And I believe the answer to the agricultural economy is not to get the government further involved, but to do what Im suggesting. In the first place, never go back to that Democratic grain embargo, that liberal Democrat grain embargo that knocked the markets right out from under us and made Mr. Gorbachev say to me when I was here, how do I know youre reliable suppliers? We never should go back to that. And we ought to expand our markets abroad. We ought to have rural enterprise zones. We ought to move forward swiftly on my ideas of ethanol which would use more corn, and therefore, create a bigger market for our agricultural products.

Warner,"Mr. Vice President, Id like to cover a subject that wasnt covered in the first debate. You have said in this campaign, I am an environmentalist, and described yourself as having zero tolerance for polluters. And yet your record does seem to suggest otherwise. When you were head of the Presidents task force on regulatory relief, you did urge EPA to relax regulations involving the elimination of lead from gasoline. I believe you urged suspension of rules requiring industries to treat toxic waste before discharging them in sewers. And your group also urged OSHA to weaken the regulations requiring that workers be informed of dangerous chemicals at the work site. Finally, I believe you did support the Presidents veto of the Clean Water Act. My question is, arent youhow do you square your campaign rhetoric with this record?",1988-10-13,Moderator
Bush,"90 percent reductions in lead since I chaired that regulatory task force; 90 percent. Its almost you remember that expression, get the lead out? Its almost out. Almost gone. Clean water? Im for clean water. But what Im not for what Im not for is measuring it the way that the Democratic Congress does. We sent up a good bill on clean water, a sound bill on clean water. But the only way you can express your love for clean water is to double the appropriations for clean water, and then rant against the deficit. I am for clean water. Ive been an outdoorsman and a sportsman all my life. Ive been to these national parks. I led for the Earl Wallop bill or formerly Dingell-Johnson. I headed the task force when I was a member of the Congress way back in the late 60s on these kinds of things, on the Republican side. I led for that. And so I refuse to measure ones commitment as to whether youre going to double the spending. That is the same old argument thats gotten us into trouble on the deficit side. So Ill just keep saying, I am one. Im not going to go down there and try to dump the sludge from Massachusetts off the beaches off of New Jersey. Im not going to do that. That boo was excessively loud. Can you add five seconds, Bernie, out of fairness? Come on, give me five. I mean, this guy, this is too much. But Im not going to do that. Im an environmentalist. I believe in our parks. I believe in the Presidents commission on outdoors. And Ill do a good job, because I am committed.",1988-10-13,Republican
Shaw,"Gov. Dukakis, you have one minute to respond.",1988-10-13,Moderator
Dukakis,"Margaret, Im not sure I can get all of this in in one minute. George, we have supply management today under the 1985 bill. Its called set-asides. Secondly, if you were so opposed to the grain embargo, why did you ask the godfather of the grain embargo to be one of your top foreign policy advisers? Im against the grain embargo; it was a mistake. Im also against the pipeline embargo, which you folks attempted to impose. That was a mistake as well, and it cost thousands of jobs for American workers in the Midwest and all over the United States of America. Margaret, once again, I dont know which George Bush Im talking about here or looking at. The George Bush who was the charter member of the environmental wrecking crew that went to Washington in the early 80s and did a job on the EPA, or the one weve been seeing and listening to the past two or three months. But let me say this, because he spent millions and millions of dollars of advertising on the subject of Boston Harbor. George, Boston Harbor was polluted for 100 years. Im the first governor to clean it up. No thanks to you. No thanks to you. Weve been cleaning it up for four years. We passed landmark legislation in 84. No thanks to you. You did everything you could to kill the Clean Water Act",1988-10-13,Democrat

Mitchell,"Mr. Vice President, Jimmy Carter has called this the worst campaign ever. Richard Nixon has called it trivial, superficial and inane. Whoever started down this road first, of negative campaigning, the American people, from all reports coming to us, are completely fed up. Now, do you have any solutions to suggest? Is there time left to fix it? There are 26 days left. For instance, would you agree to another debate, before its all over, so that the American people would have another chance before election day to compare you two?",1988-10-13,Moderator
Bush,"No. I will not agree to another debate. The American people are up to here with debates. They had thirty of them; we had seven of them. Now weve got three of them. I am going to carry this election debate all across this country in the last whatever remains of the last three and a half weeks, or whatever we have and the answer is no; I am not going to have any more debates, we dont need any more debates. Ive spelled out my position. In terms of negative campaigning, you know, I dont want to sound like a kid in the schoolyard: he started it. But take a look at the Democratic convention take a look at it. Do you remember the Senator from Boston chanting out there and the ridicule factor from that lady from Texas that was on there; I mean, come on, this was just outrageous. But Ill try harder to keep it on a high plane. If you could accept a little criticism, I went all across central Illinois and spoke about agricultural issues, about seven stops. We had some fun Crystal Gayle and Loretta Lynn with us, and they got up and sang, went to little towns and I talked agriculture. And not one thing did I see, with respect, on your network about my views on agriculture, and not one did I read in any newspaper. Why? Because you are so interested in a poll that might have been coming out, or because somebody had said something nasty about somebody else. And so I dont know what the answer is. Somebody hit me and said Barry Goldwater said you ought to talk on issues more. How can Barry Goldwater sitting in Arizona know whether Im talking on the issues or not when we put out position paper after position paper, he puts out position paper after position paper; and we see this much about it, because everyone else is fascinated with polls and whos up or down today and whos going to be up or down tomorrow. So I think we can all share, with respect, in the fact that maybe the message is not getting out. But its not getting out because there are too few debates. There will be no more debates.

Dukakis,"I can understand, after the vice presidential debate, why Mr. Bush would want no more debates. (Laughter, boos) Thats my five seconds. Andrea, I think we both have a responsibility to try to address the issues. Yes, we have fundamental differences. I think a great many of them have come out today. And I think if we get rid of the labelsand Im not keeping count, but I think Mr. Bush has used the label liberal at least ten times if I had a dollar, George, for every time you used that label, Id qualify for one of those tax breaks for the rich that you want to give away. (Laughter, applause) Isnt that the point? Most Americans believe in basic values. We have differences about how to achieve them. I want to move forward, I want this nation to move forward. I am concerned about the fact that 10 percent of our manufacturing and 20 percent of our banking and nearly half of the real estate in the city of Los Angeles are in the hands of foreign investors. I am concerned about what that does to our future. Im concerned about the fact that so many of our securities are in the hands of foreign banks because of these massive deficits. But those are the issues on which we ought to be debating and if we can just put away the flag factories and the balloons and those kinds of thing and get on to a real discussion of these issues, I think we will have a good success.",1988-10-13,Democrat
Shaw,"Andrea Mitchell has a question for you, Governor Dukakis.",1988-10-13,Moderator
Mitchell,"We are talking about issues, so lets return to something you said earlier about the modernization of land-based missiles. You said that you didnt rule it out that there are limits to what we can spend, and then you went on to talk about a much more expensive part of our defense strategy, namely, conventional forces. Do you somehow see conventional forces as a substitute for our strategic forces, and in not talking about the land-based missiles and not committing to modernizing, do you somehow believe that we can have a survivable nuclear force based on the air and sea legs of our triad?",1988-10-13,Moderator
Dukakis,"I think we ought to be looking at modernization, I think we ought to be exploring less expensive ways to get it on land, and we ought to make sure that we have an effective and strong and credible nuclear deterrent. But we also need well-equipped and well-trained and well-supported conventional forces. And every defense expert I know, including people in the Pentagon itself, will tell you that given the level of defense spending and the level of defense appropriations which the Congress has now approved and the president has signed, theres no way that you can do all of these things and do them well. Thats why tough choices will be required, choices I am prepared to make, Mr. Bush is not prepared to make. But, Andrea, I think we can go far beyond this as well, because we have opportunities now step-by-step to bring down the level of strategic weapons, get a test ban treaty, negotiate those conventional force reductions. I would challenge Mr. Gorbachev to join with us in limiting in eliminating regional conflict in the Middle East, in Central America. Lets get him working on Syria, their client state, and see if we cant get them to join Israel and other Arab nations, if at all possible, and Arab leaders, in finally bringing peace to that troubled region. And I think thats one reason why we need fresh leadership in the White House that can make progress now in bringing peace to the Middle East. Lets go to work and end this fiasco in Central America, a failed policy which has actually increased Cuban and Soviet influence. The democratic leaders of Central and Latin America want to work with us. Ive met with them, I know them, Ive spent time in South America-speak the language, so does Senator Bentsen. We want to work with them and build a new relationship, and they with us. But not a one of those key democratic leaders support our policy in Central America. And weve got to work with them if we are going to create an environment for human rights and democracy for the people of this hemisphere, and go to work on our single most important problem, and that is the avalanche of drugs that is poring into our country and virtually destroying those countries. Those are the kinds of priorities for national security and for foreign policy that I want to pursue Mr. Bush and I have major differences on these issues and I hope very much to be president and pursue them.",1988-10-13,Democrat
Shaw,"Mr. Vice President, you have one minute.",1988-10-13,Moderator
Bush,"In terms of regional tensions, we have now gotten the attention of the Soviet Union. And the reason weve gotten it is because they see us now as unwilling to make the very kinds of unilateral cuts that have been called for and to go for the discredited freeze. My opponent had trouble, criticized us, on our policy in Angola. It now looks, because of steady negotiation, that we may have an agreement that will remove the Cubans from Angola. We see the Russians coming out of Afghanistan. That wouldnt have stopped if we hadnt been willing wouldnt have even started, the Soviets coming out, if we hadnt even been willing to support the freedom fighters there. And the policy in Central America, regrettably, has failed because the Congress has been unwilling to support those who have been fighting for freedom. Those Sandinistas came in and betrayed the trust of the revolution; they said it was about democracy, and they have done nothing other than solidify their Marxist domination over that country.",1988-10-13,Republican

Compton,"Governor, nuclear weapons need nuclear material replenished on a regular basis, and just this week yet another nuclear manufacturing plant was closed because of safety concerns. Some in the Pentagon fear that too much priority has been put on new weapons programs, not enough on current programs, and worry that the resulting shortage would be amounting to nothing less than unilateral nuclear disarmament. Is that a priority that you feel has been ignored by this administration, or are the Pentagon officials making too much of it?",1988-10-13,Moderator
Dukakis,"Well, its a great concern of mine and I think of all Americans, and perhaps the vice president can tell us whats been going on. This is another example of misplaced priorities. An administration which wants to billions on weapons systems that we dont need and cant afford, and now confronts us with a very serious problem, and plants that are supposed to be producing tritium and plutonium and providing the necessary materials for existing weapons. Yes, if we dont do something about it, we may find ourselves unilaterally, if I may use that term, dismantling some of these weapons. Whats been going on? Whos been in charge? Whos been managing this system? Why have there been these safety violations? Why are these plants being closed down? I dont know what the latest cost estimates are, but its going to be in the range of 25, 50, 75, $100 billion. Now, somebody has to bear the responsibility for this. Maybe the Vice President has an answer. But Im somebody who believes very strongly in taking care of the fundamentals first before you start new stuff. And thats something which will be a priority of ours in the new administration because without it, we cannot have the effective and strong and credible nuclear deterrent we must have.",1988-10-13,Democrat

Will he join me in suggesting that we may need another plant? Maybe in Idaho, to take care of the requirements, nuclear material requirements, for our Defense Department? I hope he will. This sounds like real progress here, because weve had a big difference on the safe use of nuclear power for our energy base. I believe that we must use clean, safe nuclear power. I believe that the more dependent we become on foreign oil, the less our national security is enhanced. And therefore, Ive made some proposals to strengthen the domestic oil industry by more incentive going in to look for, and find, and produce oil; made some incentives in terms of secondary and tertiary production. But were going to have to use more gas, more coal and more safe nuclear power for our energy base. So I am one who believes that we can",1988-10-13,Republican

Compton,"Mr. Vice President, as many as 100 officials in this Administration have left the government under an ethical cloud. Some have been indicted, some convicted. Many of the cases have involved undue influence once theyre outside of government. If you become president, will you lock that revolving door that has allowed some men and women in the government to come back and lobby the very departments they once managed?",1988-10-13,Moderator
Bush,"Yes, and Ill apply it to Congress too. Ill do both. Ill do both. Because I think you see, I am one who I get kidded by being a little old fashioned on these things, but I do believe in public service. I believe that public service is honorable. And I dont think anybody has a call on people in their Administrations going astray. His chief education adviser is in jail Hes in jail because he betrayed the public trust. The head of education. And yet this man, the governor, equated the President to a rotting fish. He said that a fish rots from the head down as he was going after Ed Meese. Look, we need the highest possible ethical standards. I will have an ethical office in the White House that will be under the Presidents personal concern. I will see that these standards apply to the United States Congress. I hope I will do a good job as one who has had a relatively clean record with no conflicts of interest in his own public life, as has the Governor, to exhort young people to get into public service. But there is no corner on this sleaze factor, believe me. And its a disgrace, and I will do my level best to clean it up, recognizing that you cant legislate morality. But I do believe that with my record in Congress, having led the new Congressmen to a code of ethics through major main emphasis on it in full disclosure, that Ive got a good record. And there are more, if you want to talk about percentage appointments, more Members of Congress who have been under investigation percentage-wise that people in the executive branch. And so it isnt one and state governments have had a tough time. His some of his college presidents arent exactly holier than thou. So lets not be throwing stones about it. Lets say, this isnt Democrat or Republican, and it isnt liberal or conservative. Lets vow to work together to do something about it.",1988-10-13,Republican

Wasnt this the George Bush that supported Mr. Meese? Called James Watt an excellent Secretary of the Interior? Provided support for some of these people, supported the nomination of Robert Bork to the Supreme Court of the United States. Weve had dozens weve had dozens and dozens of officials in this Administration who have left under a cloud, who have left with the special prosecutor in their arm, have been indicted, convicted. This isnt the kind of Administration we need. And one of the reasons our selection of a running mate is so important, it is such a test of the kinds of standards well set, is because it tells the American people in advance of the election just what kind of people were looking for.

Our opponents say, things are okay. Dont rock the boat. Not to worry. They say we should be satisfied. But I dont think we can be satisfied when were spending $150 billion a year in interest alone on the national debt, much of it going to foreign bankers; or when 25 percent of our high school students are dropping out of school; or when we have 2-1/2 million of our fellow citizens, a third of them veterans, who are homeless and living on streets and in doorways in this country, when Mr. Bushs prescription for our economic future is another tax giveaway to the rich. We can do better than that. Not working with government alone, but all of us working together. Lloyd Bentsen and I are optimists, and so are the American people. And we ask you for our hand for your hands and your hearts, and your votes on the 8th of November so we can move forward in the future.

Bush,"Sometimes it does seem that a campaign generates more heat than light. So let me repeat, I do have respect for my opponent, for his family, for the justifiable pride he takes in his heritage. But we have enormous differences. I want to hold the line on taxes, and keep this the longest expansion in modern history going until everybody in America benefits. I want to invest in our children. Because I mean it when I say I want a kinder and gentler nation. And by that I want to have child care where the families, the parents, have control. I want to keep our neighborhoods much, much better in terms of anti-crime, and thats why I would appoint judges that have a little more sympathy for the victims of crime and a little less for the criminals. Thats why I do feel if some police officer is gunned down that the death penalty is required. I want to help those with disabilities fit into the mainstream. There is much to be done. This election is about big things. And perhaps the biggest is world peace. And I ask you to consider the experience I have had in working with a President who has revolutionized the situation around the world. America stands tall again, and as a result, we are credible. And we have now achieved an historic arms control agreement. I want to build on that. Id love to be able to say to my grandchildren, four years after my first term, Id like to say, your grandfather, working with the leaders of the Soviet Union, working with the leaders of Europe, was able to ban chemical and biological weapons from the face of the earth. Lincoln called this country the last best hope of man on earth. And he was right then, and we still are the last best hope of man on earth. And I ask for your support on November 8th. And I will be a good president. Working together, we can do wonderful things for the United States and the Free World. Thank you very, very much.",1988-10-13,Republican
Senator Kennedy,"Mr. Smith, Mr. Nixon. In the election of 1860, Abraham Lincoln said the question was whether this nation could exist half-slave or half-free. In the election of 1960, and with the world around us, the question is whether the world will exist half-slave or half-free, whether it will move in the direction of freedom, in the direction of the road that we are taking, or whether it will move in the direction of slavery. I think it will depend in great measure upon what we do here in the United States, on the kind of society that we build, on the kind of strength that we maintain. We discuss tonight domestic issues, but I would not want that to be any implication to be given that this does not involve directly our struggle with Mr. Khrushchev for survival. Mr. Khrushchev is in New York, and he maintains the Communist offensive throughout the world because of the productive power of the Soviet Union itself. The Chinese Communists have always had a large population. But they are important and dangerous now because they are mounting a major effort within their own country. The kind of country we have here, the kind of society we have, the kind of strength we build in the United States will be the defense of freedom. If we do well here, if we meet our obligations, if were moving ahead, then I think freedom will be secure around the world. If we fail, then freedom fails. Therefore, I think the question before the American people is: Are we doing as much as we can do? Are we as strong as we should be? Are we as strong as we must be if were going to maintain our independence, and if were going to maintain and hold out the hand of friendship to those who look to us for assistance, to those who look to us for survival? I should make it very clear that I do not think were doing enough, that I am not satisfied as an American with the progress that were making. This is a great country, but I think it could be a greater country; and this is a powerful country, but I think it could be a more powerful country. Im not satisfied to have fifty percent of our steel-mill capacity unused. Im not satisfied when the United States had last year the lowest rate of economic growth of any major industrialized society in the world. Because economic growth means strength and vitality; it means were able to sustain our defenses; it means were able to meet our commitments abroad. Im not satisfied when we have over nine billion dollars worth of food  some of it rotting  even though there is a hungry world, and even though four million Americans wait every month for a food package from the government, which averages five cents a day per individual. I saw cases in West Virginia, here in the United States, where children took home part of their school lunch in order to feed their families because I dont think were meeting our obligations toward these Americans. Im not satisfied when the Soviet Union is turning out twice as many scientists and engineers as we are. Im not satisfied when many of our teachers are inadequately paid, or when our children go to school part-time shifts. I think we should have an educational system second to none. Im not satisfied when I see men like Jimmy Hoffa  in charge of the largest union in the United States  still free. Im not satisfied when we are failing to develop the natural resources of the United States to the fullest. Here in the United States, which developed the Tennessee Valley and which built the Grand Coulee and the other dams in the Northwest United States at the present rate of hydropower production  and that is the hallmark of an industrialized society  the Soviet Union by 1975 will be producing more power than we are. These are all the things, I think, in this country that can make our society strong, or can mean that it stands still. Im not satisfied until every American enjoys his full constitutional rights. If a Negro baby is born  and this is true also of Puerto Ricans and Mexicans in some of our cities  he has about one-half as much chance to get through high school as a white baby. He has one-third as much chance to get through college as a white student. He has about a third as much chance to be a professional man, about half as much chance to own a house. He has about uh  four times as much chance that hell be out of work in his life as the white baby. I think we can do better. I dont want the talents of any American to go to waste. I know that there are those who want to turn everything over to the government. I dont at all. I want the individuals to meet their responsibilities. And I want the states to meet their responsibilities. But I think there is also a national responsibility. The argument has been used against every piece of social legislation in the last twenty-five years. The people of the United States individually could not have developed the Tennessee Valley; collectively they could have. A cotton farmer in Georgia or a peanut farmer or a dairy farmer in Wisconsin and Minnesota, he cannot protect himself against the forces of supply and demand in the market place; but working together in effective governmental programs he can do so. Seventeen million Americans, who live over sixty-five on an average Social Security check of about seventy-eight dollars a month, theyre not able to sustain themselves individually, but they can sustain themselves through the social security system. I dont believe in big government, but I believe in effective governmental action. And I think thats the only way that the United States is going to maintain its freedom. Its the only way that were going to move ahead. I think we can do a better job. I think were going to have to do a better job if we are going to meet the responsibilities which time and events have placed upon us. We cannot turn the job over to anyone else. If the United States fails, then the whole cause of freedom fails. And I think it depends in great measure on what we do here in this country. The reason Franklin Roosevelt was a good neighbor in Latin America was because he was a good neighbor in the United States. Because they felt that the American society was moving again. I want us to recapture that image. I want people in Latin America and Africa and Asia to start to look to America; to see how were doing things; to wonder what the resident of the United States is doing; and not to look at Khrushchev, or look at the Chinese Communists. That is the obligation upon our generation. In 1933, Franklin Roosevelt said in his inaugural that this generation of Americans has a rendezvous with destiny. I think our generation of Americans has the same rendezvous. The question now is: Can freedom be maintained under the most severe tack  attack it has ever known? I think it can be. And I think in the final analysis it depends upon what we do here. I think its time America started moving again.",1960-09-26,Democrat
Mr. Smith,And now the opening statement by Vice President Richard M. Nixon.,1960-09-26,Moderator
Mr. Nixon,"Mr. Smith, Senator Kennedy. The things that Senator Kennedy has said many of us can agree with. There is no question but that we cannot discuss our internal affairs in the United States without recognizing that they have a tremendous bearing on our international position. There is no question but that this nation cannot stand still; because we are in a deadly competition, a competition not only with the men in the Kremlin, but the men in Peking. Were ahead in this competition, as Senator Kennedy, I think, has implied. But when youre in a race, the only way to stay ahead is to move ahead. And I subscribe completely to the spirit that Senator Kennedy has expressed tonight, the spirit that the United States should move ahead. Where, then, do we disagree? I think we disagree on the implication of his remarks tonight and on the statements that he has made on many occasions during his campaign to the effect that the United States has been standing still. We heard tonight, for example, the statement made that our growth in national product last year was the lowest of any industrial nation in the world. Now last year, of course, was 1958. That happened to be a recession year. But when we look at the growth of G.N.P. this year, a year of recovery, we find that its six and nine-tenths per cent and one of the highest in the world today. More about that later. Looking then to this problem of how the United States should move ahead and where the United States is moving, I think it is well that we take the advice of a very famous campaigner: Lets look at the record. Is the United States standing still? Is it true that this Administration, as Senator Kennedy has charged, has been an Administration of retreat, of defeat, of stagnation? Is it true that, as far as this country is concerned, in the field of electric power, in all of the fields that he has mentioned, we have not been moving ahead. Well, we have a comparison that we can make. We have the record of the Truman Administration of seven and a half years and the seven and a half years of the Eisenhower Administration. When we compare these two records in the areas that Senator Kennedy has  has discussed tonight, I think we find that America has been moving ahead. Lets take schools. We have built more schools in these last seven and a half years than we built in the previous seven and a half, for that matter in the previous twenty years. Lets take hydroelectric power. We have developed more hydroelectric power in these seven and a half years than was developed in any previous administration in history. Let us take hospitals. We find that more have been built in this Administration than in the previous Administration. The same is true of highways. Lets put it in terms that all of us can understand. We often hear gross national product discussed and in that respect may I say that when we compare the growth in this Administration with that of the previous Administration that then there was a total growth of eleven percent over seven years; in this Administration there has been a total growth of nineteen per cent over seven years. That shows that theres been more growth in this Administration than in its predecessor. But lets not put it there; lets put it in terms of the average family. What has happened to you? We find that your wages have gone up five times as much in the Eisenhower Administration as they did in the Truman Administration. What about the prices you pay? We find that the prices you pay went up five times as much in the Truman Administration as they did in the Eisenhower Administration. Whats the net result of this? This means that the average family income went up fifteen per cent in the Eisenhower years as against two per cent in the Truman years. Now, this is not standing still. But, good as this record is, may I emphasize it isnt enough. A record is never something to stand on. Its something to build on. And in building on this record, I believe that we have the secret for progress, we know the way to progress. And I think, first of all, our own record proves that we know the way. Senator Kennedy has suggested that he believes he knows the way. I respect the sincerity which he m- which he makes that suggestion. But on the other hand, when we look at the various programs that he offers, they do not seem to be new. They seem to be simply retreads of the programs of the Truman Administration which preceded it. And I would suggest that during the course of the evening he might indicate those areas in which his programs are new, where they will mean more progress than we had then. What kind of programs are we for? We are for programs that will expand educational opportunities, that will give to all Americans their equal chance for education, for all of the things which are necessary and dear to the hearts of our people. We are for programs, in addition, which will see that our medical care for the aged are  is  are much  is much better handled than it is at the present time. Here again, may I indicate that Senator Kennedy and I are not in disagreement as to the aims. We both want to help the old people. We want to see that they do have adequate medical care. The question is the means. I think that the means that I advocate will reach that goal better than the means that he advocates. I could give better examples, but for  for whatever it is, whether its in the field of housing, or health, or medical care, or schools, or the eh- development of electric power, we have programs which we believe will move America, move her forward and build on the wonderful record that we have made over these past seven and a half years. Now, when we look at these programs, might I suggest that in evaluating them we often have a tendency to say that the test of a program is how much youre spending. I will concede that in all the areas to which I have referred Senator Kennedy would have the spe- federal government spend more than I would have it spend. I costed out the cost of the Democratic platform. It runs a minimum of thirteen and two-tenths billions dollars a year more than we are presently spending to a maximum of eighteen billion dollars a year more than were presently spending. Now the Republican platform will cost more too. It will cost a minimum of four billion dollars a year more, a maximum of four and nine-tenths billion dollar a year more than were presently spending. Now, does this mean that his program is better than ours? Not at all. Because it isnt a question of how much the federal government spends; it isnt a question of which government does the most. It is a question of which administration does the right thing. And in our case, I do believe that our programs will stimulate the creative energies of a hundred and eighty million free Americans. I believe the programs that Senator Kennedy advocates will have a tendency to stifle those creative energies, I believe in other words, that his program would lead to the stagnation of the motive power that we need in this country to get progress. The final point that I would like to make is this: Senator Kennedy has suggested in his speeches that we lack compassion for the poor, for the old, and for others that are unfortunate. Let us understand throughout this campaign that his motives and mine are sincere. I know what it means to be poor. I know what it means to see people who are unemployed. I know Senator Kennedy feels as deeply about these problems as I do, but our disagreement is not about the goals for America but only about the means to reach those goals.",1960-09-26,Republican
Mr. Smith,"Thank you, Mr. Nixon. That completes the opening statements, and now the candidates will answer questions or comment upon one anothers answers to questions, put by correspondents of the networks. The correspondents: [introducing themselves: Im Sander Vanocur, NBC News; Im Charles Warren, Mutual News; Im Stuart Novins, CBS News; Bob Fleming, ABC News.] The first question to Senator Kennedy from Mr. Fleming.",1960-09-26,Moderator
Mr. Fleming,"Senator, the Vice President in his campaign has said that you were naive and at times immature. He has raised the question of leadership. On this issue, why do you think people should vote for you rather than the Vice President?",1960-09-26,Moderator
Mr. Kennedy,"Well, the Vice President and I came to the Congress together 1946; we both served in the Labor Committee. Ive been there now for fourteen years, the same period of time that he has, so that our experience in uh  government is comparable. Secondly, I think the question is uh  what are the programs that we advocate, what is the party record that we lead? I come out of the Democratic party, which in this century has produced Woodrow Wilson and Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman, and which supported and sustained these programs which Ive discussed tonight. Mr. Nixon comes out of the Republican party. He was nominated by it. And it is a fact that through most of these last twenty-five years the Republican leadership has opposed federal aid for education, medical care for the aged, development of the Tennessee Valley, development of our natural resources. I think Mr. Nixon is an effective leader of his party. I hope he would grant me the same. The question before us is: which point of view and which party do we want to lead the United States?",1960-09-26,Democrat
Mr. Smith,"Mr. Nixon, would you like to comment on that statement?",1960-09-26,Moderator
Mr. Nixon,I have no comment.,1960-09-26,Republican
Mr. Smith,The next question: Mr. Novins.,1960-09-26,Moderator
Mr. Novins,"Mr. Vice President, your campaign stresses the value of your eight year experience, and the question arises as to whether that experience was as an observer or as a participant or as an initiator of policy-making. Would you tell us please specifically what major proposals you have made in the last eight years that have been adopted by the Administration?",1960-09-26,Moderator
Mr. Nixon,"It would be rather difficult to cover them in eight and- in two and a half minutes. I would suggest that these proposals could be mentioned. First, after each of my foreign trips I have made recommendations that have been adopted. For example, after my first trip abroad  abroad, I strongly recommended that we increase our exchange programs particularly as they related to exchange of persons of leaders in the labor field and in the information field. After my trip to South America, I made recommendations that a separate inter-American lending agency be set up which the South American nations would like much better than a lend- than to participate in the lending agencies which treated all the countries of the world the same. Uh  I have made other recommendations after each of the other trips; for example, after my trip abroad to Hungary I made some recommendations with regard to the Hungarian refugee situation which were adopted, not only by the President but some of them were enacted into law by the Congress. Within the Administration, as a chairman of the Presidents Committee on Price Stability and Economic Growth, I have had the opportunity to make recommendations which have been adopted within the Administration and which I think have been reasonably effective. I know Senator Kennedy suggested in his speech at Cleveland yesterday that that committee had not been particularly effective. I would only suggest that while we do not take the credit for it  I would not presume to  that since that committee has been formed the price line has been held very well within the United States.",1960-09-26,Republican
Mr. Kennedy,"Well, I would say in the latter that the  and thats what I found uh  somewhat unsatisfactory about the figures uh  Mr. Nixon, that you used in your previous speech, when you talked about the Truman Administration. You  Mr. Truman came to office in nineteen uh  forty-four and at the end of the war, and uh  difficulties that were facing the United States during that period of transition  1946 when price controls were lifted  so its rather difficult to use an overall figure taking those seven and a half years and comparing them to the last eight years. I prefer to take the overall percentage record of the last twenty years of the Democrats and the eight years of the Republicans to show an overall period of growth. In regard to uh  price stability uh  Im not aware that that committee did produce recommendations that ever were certainly before the Congress from the point of view of legislation in regard to controlling prices. In regard to the exchange of students and labor unions, I am chairman of the subcommittee on Africa and I think that one of the most unfortunate phases of our policy towards that country was the very minute number of exchanges that we had. I think its true of Latin America also. We did come forward with a program of students for the Congo of over three hundred which was more than the federal government had for all of Africa the previous year, so that I dont think that uh  we have moved at least in those two areas with sufficient vigor.",1960-09-26,Democrat
Mr. Smith,The next question to Senator Kennedy from Mr. Warren.,1960-09-26,Moderator
Mr. Warren,"Uh  Senator Kennedy, during your brief speech a few minutes ago you mentioned farm surpluses.",1960-09-26,Moderator
Mr. Kennedy,Thats correct.,1960-09-26,Democrat
Mr. Warren,"Id like to ask this: Its a fact, I think, that presidential candidates traditionally make promises to farmers. Lots of people, I think, dont understand why the government pays farmers for not producing certain crops or paying farmers if they overproduce for that matter. Now, let me ask, sir, why cant the farmer operate like the business man who operates a factory? If an auto company overproduces a certain model car Uncle Sam doesnt step in and buy up the surplus. Why this constant courting of the farmer?",1960-09-26,Moderator
Mr. Kennedy,"Well, because I think that if the federal government moved out of the program and withdrew its supports uh  then I think you would have complete uh  economic chaos. The farmer plants in the spring and harvests in the fall. There are hundreds of thousands of them. They really dont  theyre not able to control their market very well. They bring their crops in or their livestock in, many of them about the same time. They have only a few purchasers that buy their milk or their hogs  a few large companies in many cases  and therefore the farmer is not in a position to bargain very effectively in the market place. I think the experience of the twenties has shown what a free market could do to agriculture. And if the agricultural economy collapses, then the economy of the rest of the United States sooner or later will collapse. The farmers are the number one market for the automobile industry of the United States. The automobile industry is the number one market for steel. So if the farmers economy continues to decline as sharply as it has in recent years, then I think you would have a recession in the rest of the country. So I think the case for the government intervention is a good one. Secondly, my objection to present farm policy is that there are no effective controls to bring supply and demand into better balance. The dropping of the support price in order to limit production does not work, and we now have the highest uh  surpluses  nine billion dollars worth. Weve had a uh  higher tax load from the Treasury for the farmer in the last few years with the lowest farm income in many years. I think that this farm policy has failed. In my judgment the only policy that will work will be for effective supply and demand to be in balance. And that can only be done through governmental action. I therefore suggest that in those basic commodities which are supported, that the federal government, after endorsement by the farmers in that commodity, attempt to bring supply and demand into balance  attempt effective production controls  so that we wont have that five or six per cent surplus which breaks the price fifteen or twenty per cent. I think Mr. Bensons program has failed. And I must say, after reading the Vice Presidents speech before the farmers, as he read mine, I dont believe that its very much different from Mr. Bensons. I dont think it provides effective governmental controls. I think the support prices are tied to the average market price of the last three years, which was Mr. Bensons theory. I therefore do not believe that this is a sharp enough breach with the past to give us any hope of success for the future.",1960-09-26,Democrat
Mr. Smith,"Mr. Nixon, comment? MR. NIXON; I of course disagree with Senator Kennedy insofar as his suggestions as to what should be done uh  with re- on the farm program. He has made the suggestion that what we need is to move in the direction of more government controls, a suggestion that would also mean raising prices uh  that the consumers pay for products and im- and imposing upon the farmers uh  controls on acreage even far more than they have today. I think this is the wrong direction. I dont think this has worked in the past; I do not think it will work in the future. The program that I have advocated is one which departs from the present program that we have in this respect. It recognizes that the government has a responsibility to get the farmer out of the trouble he presently is in because the government got him into it. And thats the fundamental reason why we cant let the farmer go by himself at the present time. The farmer produced these surpluses because the government asked him to through legislation during the war. Now that we have these surpluses, its our responsibility to indemnify the farmer during that period that we get rid of the farmer uh  the surpluses. Until we get the surpluses off the farmers back, however, we should have a program such as I announced, which will see that farm income holds up. But I would propose holding that income up not through a type of program that Senator Kennedy has suggested that would raise prices, but one that would indemnify the farmer, pay the farmer in kind uh  from the products which are in surplus.",1960-09-26,Moderator
Mr. Smith,The next question to Vice President Nixon from Mr. Vanocur.,1960-09-26,Moderator
Mr. Vanocur,"Uh  Mr. Vice President, since the question of executive leadership is a very important campaign issue, Id like to follow Mr. Novins question. Now, Republican campaign slogans  youll see them on signs around the country as you did last week  say its experience that counts  thats over a picture of yourself; sir uh  implying that youve had more governmental executive decision-making uh  experience than uh  your opponent. Now, in his news conference on August twenty-fourth, President Eisenhower was asked to give one example of a major idea of yours that he adopted. His reply was, and Im quoting; If you give me a week I might think of one. I dont remember. Now that was a month ago, sir, and the President hasnt brought it up since, and Im wondering, sir, if you can clarify which version is correct  the one put out by Republican campaign leaders or the one put out by President Eisenhower?",1960-09-26,Moderator
Mr. Nixon,"Well, I would suggest, Mr. Vanocur, that uh  if you know the President, that was probably a facetious remark. Uh  I would also suggest that insofar as his statement is concerned, that I think it would be improper for the President of the United States to disclose uh  the instances in which members of his official family had made recommendations, as I have made them through the years to him, which he has accepted or rejected. The President has always maintained and very properly so that he is entitled to get what advice he wants from his cabinet and from his other advisers without disclosing that to anybody  including as a matter of fact the Congress. Now, I can only say this. Through the years I have sat in the National Security Council. I have been in the cabinet. I have met with the legislative leaders. I have met with the President when he made the great decisions with regard to Lebanon, Quemoy and Matsu, other matters. The President has asked for my advice. I have given it. Sometimes my advice has been taken. Sometimes it has not. I do not say that I have made the decisions. And I would say that no president should ever allow anybody else to make the major decisions, The president only makes the decisions. All that his advisers do is to give counsel when he asks for it. As far as what experience counts and whether that is experience that counts, that isnt for me to say. Uh  I can only say that my experience is there for the people to consider; Senator Kennedys is there for the people to consider. As he pointed out, we came to the Congress in the same year. His experience has been different from mine. Mine has been in the executive branch. His has been in the legislative branch. I would say that the people now have the opportunity to evaluate his as against mine and I think both he and I are going to abide by whatever the people decide.",1960-09-26,Republican
Mr. Smith,Senator Kennedy.,1960-09-26,Moderator
Mr. Kennedy,"Well, Ill just say that the question is of experience and the question also is uh  what our judgment is of the future, and what our goals are for the United States, and what ability we have to implement those goals. Abraham Lincoln came to the presidency in 1860 after a rather little known uh  session in the House of Representatives and after being defeated for the Senate in fifty-eight and was a distinguished president. Theres no certain road to the presidency. There are no guarantees that uh  if you take uh  one road or another that you will be a successful president. I have been in the Congress for fourteen years. I have voted in the last uh  eight years uh  and the Vice President was uh  presiding over the Senate and meeting his other responsibilities. I have met met uh  decisions over eight hundred times on matters which affect not only the domestic security of the United States, but as a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. The question really is: which candidate and which party can meet the problems that the United States is going to face in the sixties?",1960-09-26,Democrat
Mr. Smith,The next question to Senator Kennedy from Mr. Novins.,1960-09-26,Moderator
Mr. Novins,"Senator Kennedy, in connection with these problems of the future that you speak of, and the program that you enunciated earlier in your direct talk, you call for expanding some of the welfare programs for schools, for teacher salaries, medical care, and so forth; but you also call for reducing the federal debt. And Im wondering how you, if youre president in January, would go about paying the bill for all this. Does this mean that you?",1960-09-26,Moderator
Mr. Kennedy,"I didnt indicate. I did not advocate reducing the federal debt because I dont believe that youre going to be able to reduce the federal debt very much in nineteen sixty-one, two, or three. I think you have heavy obligations which affect our security, which were going to have to meet. And therefore Ive never suggested we should uh  be able to retire the debt substantially, or even at all in nineteen sixty-one or two.",1960-09-26,Democrat
Mr. Novins,"Senator, I believe in  in one of your speeches",1960-09-26,Moderator
Mr. Kennedy,"No, never.",1960-09-26,Democrat
Mr. Novins, you suggested that reducing the interest rate would help toward,1960-09-26,Moderator
Mr. Kennedy,No. No. Not reducing the interest,1960-09-26,Democrat
Mr. Novins, a reduction of the Federal debt.,1960-09-26,Moderator
Mr. Kennedy," reducing the interest rate. In my judgment, the hard money, tight money policy, fiscal policy of this Administration has contributed to the slow-down in our economy, which helped bring the recession of fifty-four; which made the recession of fifty-eight rather intense, and which has slowed, somewhat, our economic activity in 1960. What I have talked about, however, the kind of programs that Ive talked about, in my judgment, are uh  fiscally sound. Medical care for the aged, I would put under social security. The Vice President and I disagree on this. The program  the Javits-Nixon or the Nixon-Javits program  would have cost, if fully used uh  six hundred million dollars by the government per year, and six hundred million dollars by the state. The program which I advocated, which failed by five votes in the United States Senate, would have put medical care for the aged in Social Security, and would have been paid for through the Social Security System and the Social Security tax. Secondly, I support federal aid to education and federal aid for teachers salaries. I think thats a good investment. I think were going to have to do it. And I think to heap the burden further on the property tax, which is already strained in many of our communities, will provide, will make sh- insure, in my opinion, that many of our children will not be adequately educated, and many of our teachers not adequately compensated. There is no greater return to an economy or to a society than an educational system second to none. On the question of the development of natural resources, I would pay as you go in the sense that they would be balanced and the power revenues would bring back sufficient money to finance the projects, in the same way as the Tennessee Valley. I believe in the balanced budget. And the only conditions under which I would unbalance the budget would be if there was a grave national emergency or a serious recession. Otherwise, with a steady rate of economic growth  and Mr. Nixon and Mr. Rockefeller, in their meeting, said a five per cent economic growth would bring by 1962 ten billion dollars extra in tax revenues. Whatever is brought in, I think that we can finance essential programs within a balanced budget, if business remains orderly.",1960-09-26,Democrat
Mr. Smith,"Mr. Nixon, your comment?",1960-09-26,Moderator
Mr. Nixon,"Yes. I think what Mr. Novins was referring to was not one of Senator Kennedys speeches, but the Democratic platform, which did mention cutting the national debt. I think, too, that it should be pointed out that of course it is not possible, particularly under the proposals that Senator Kennedy has advocated, either to cut the national debt or to reduce taxes. As a matter of fact it will be necessary to raise taxes. As Senator Kennedy points out that as far as his one proposal is concerned  the one for medical care for the aged  that that would be financed out of Social Security. That, however, is raising taxes for those who pay Social Security. He points out that he would make pay-as-you-go be the basis for our natural resources development. Where our natural resources development  which I also support, incidentally, however  whenever you uh  uh  in  in  uh  appropriates money for one of these projects, you have to pay now and appropriate the money and the eh- while they eventually do pay out, it doesnt mean that you  the government doesnt have to put out the money this year. And so I would say that in all of these proposals Senator Kennedy has made, they will result in one of two things: either he has to raise taxes or he has to unbalance the budget. If he unbalances the budget, that means you have inflation, and that will be, of course, a very cruel blow to the very people  the older people  that weve been talking about. As far as aid for school construction is concerned, I favor that, as Senator Kennedy did, in January of this year, when he said he favored that rather than aid to s- teacher salaries. I favor that because I believe thats the best way to aid our schools without running any risk whatever of the federal government telling our teachers what to teach.",1960-09-26,Republican
Mr. Smith,The next question to Vice President Nixon from Mr. Warren.,1960-09-26,Moderator
Mr. Warren,"Mr. Vice President you mentioned schools and it was just yesterday I think you asked for a crash program to raise education standards, and this evening you talked about advances in education. Mr. Vice President, you said  it was back in 1957  that salaries paid to school teachers were nothing short of a national disgrace. Higher salaries for teachers, you added, were important and if the situation wasnt corrected it could lead to a national disaster. And yet, you refused to vote in the Senate in order to break a tie vote when that single vote, if it had been yes, would have granted salary increases to teachers. I wonder if you could explain that, sir.",1960-09-26,Moderator
Mr. Nixon,"Im awfully glad you ge- got that question because as you know I got into it at the last of my other question and wasnt able to complete the argument. Uh  I think that the reason that I voted against having the federal government uh  pay teachers salaries was probably the very reason that concerned Senator Kennedy when in January of this year, in his kick-off press conference, he said that he favored aid for school construction, but at that time did not feel that there should be aid for teachers salaries  at least thats the way I read his remarks. Now, why should there be any question about the federal government aiding s- teachers salaries? Why did Senator Kennedy take that position then? Why do I take it now? We both took it then, and I take it now, for this reason: we want higher teachers salaries. We need higher teachers salaries. But we also want our education to be free of federal control. When the federal government gets the power to pay teachers, inevitably in my opinion, it will acquire the power to set standards and to tell the teachers what to teach. I think this would be bad for the country; I think it would be bad for the teaching profession. There is another point that should be made. I favor higher salaries for teachers. But, as Senator Kennedy said in January of this year in this same press conference, the way that you get higher salaries for teachers is to support school construction, which means that all of the local school districts in the various states then have money which is freed to raise the standards for teachers salaries. I should also point out this; once you put the responsibility on the federal government for paying a portion of teachers salaries, your local communities and your states are not going to meet the responsibility as much as they should. I believe, in other words, that we have seen the local communities and the state assuming more of that responsibility. Teachers salaries very fortunately have gone up fifty percent in the last eight years as against only a thirty-four percent rise for other salaries. This is not enough; it should be more. But I do not believe that the way to get more salaries for teachers is to have the federal government get in with a massive program. My objection here is not the cost in dollars. My objection here is the potential cost in controls and eventual freedom for the American people by giving the federal government power over education, and that is the greatest power a government can have.",1960-09-26,Republican
Mr. Smith,Senator Kennedys comment?,1960-09-26,Moderator
Mr. Kennedy,"When uh  the Vice President quotes me in January, sixty, I do not believe the federal government should pay directly teachers salaries, but that was not the issue before the Senate in February. The issue before the Senate was that the money would be given to the state. The state then could determine whether the money would be spent for school construction or teacher salaries. On that question the Vice President and I disagreed. I voted in favor of that proposal and supported it strongly, because I think that that provided assistance to our teachers for their salaries without any chance of federal control and it is on that vote that th- Mr. Nixon and I disagreed, and his tie vote uh  defeated his breaking the tie defeated the proposal. I dont want the federal government paying teachers salaries directly. But if the money will go to the states and the states can then determine whether it shall go for school construction or for teachers salaries, in my opinion you protect the local authority over the school board and the school committee. And therefore I think that was a sound proposal and that is why I supported it and I regret that it did not pass. Secondly, there have been statements made that uh  the Democratic platform would cost a good deal of money and that I am in favor of unbalancing the budget. That is wholly wrong, wholly in error, and it is a fact that in the last eight years the Democratic Congress has reduced the appropri- the requests for the appropriations by over ten billion dollars. That is not my view and I think it ought to be stated very clearly on the record. My view is that you can do these programs  and they should be carefully drawn  within a balanced budget if our economy is moving ahead.",1960-09-26,Democrat
Mr. Smith,The next question to Senator Kennedy from Mr. Vanocur.,1960-09-26,Moderator
Mr. Vanocur,"Senator, youve been promising the voters that if you are elected president youll try and push through Congress bills on medical aid to the aged, a comprehensive minimum hourly wage bill, federal aid to education. Now, in the August post-convention session of the Congress, when you at least held up the possibility you could one day be president and when you had overwhelming majorities, especially in the Senate, you could not get action on these bills. Now how do you feel that youll be able to get them in January",1960-09-26,Moderator
Mr. Kennedy,Well as you take the bills,1960-09-26,Democrat
Mr. Vanocur, if you werent able to get them in August?,1960-09-26,Moderator
Mr. Kennedy,"If I may take the bills, we did pass in the Senate a bill uh  to provide a dollar twenty-five cent minimum wage. It failed because the House did not pass it and the House failed by eleven votes. And I might say that two-thirds of the Republicans in the House voted against a dollar twenty-five cent minimum wage and a majority of the Democrats sustained it  nearly two-thirds of them voted for the dollar twenty-five. We were threatened by a veto if we passed a dollar and a quarter  its extremely difficult with the great power that the president does to pass any bill when the president is opposed to it. All the president needs to sustain his veto of any bill is one-third plus one in either the House or the Senate. Secondly, we passed a federal aid to education bill in the Senate. It failed to came to the floor of the House of Representatives. It was killed in the Rules Committee. And it is a fact in the August session that the four members of the Rules Committee who were Republicans joining with two Democrats voted against sending the aid to education bill to the floor of the House. Four Democrats voted for it. Every Republican on the Rules Committee voted against sending that bill to be considered by the members of the House of Representatives. Thirdly, on medical care for the aged, this is the same fight thats been going on for twenty-five years in Social Security. We wanted to tie it to Social Security. We offered an amendment to do so. Forty-four Democrats voted for it, one Republican voted for it. And we were informed at the time it came to a vote that if it was adopted the President of the United States would veto it. In my judgment, a vigorous Democratic president supported by a Democratic majority in the House and Senate can win the support for these programs. But if you send a Republican president and a Democratic majority and the threat of a veto hangs over the Congress, in my judgment you will continue what happened in the August session, which is a clash of parties and inaction.",1960-09-26,Democrat
Mr. Smith,"Mr. Nixon, comment?",1960-09-26,Moderator
Mr. Nixon,"Well obviously my views are a little different. First of all, I dont see how its possible for a one-third of a body, such as the Republicans have in the House and the Senate to stop two-thirds, if the two-thirds are adequately led. I would say, too, that when Senator Kennedy refers to the action of the House Rules Committee, there are eight Democrats on that committee and four Republicans. It would seem to me again that it is very difficult to blame the four Republicans for the eight Democrats not getting a something through that particular committee. I would say further that to blame the President in his veto power for the inability of the Senator and his colleagues to get action in this special session uh  misses the mark. When the president exercises his veto power, he has to have the people upo- behind him, not just a third of the Congress. Because lets consider it. If the majority of the members of the Congress felt that these particular proposals were good issues  the majority of those who were Democrats  why didnt they pass them and send to the President and get a veto and have an issue? The reason why these particular bills in these various fields that have been mentioned were not passed was not because the President was against them; it was because the people were against them. It was because they were too extreme. And I am convinced that the alternate proposals that I have, that the Republicans have in the field of health, in the field of education, in the field of welfare, because they are not extreme, because they will accomplish the end uh  without too great cost in dollars or in freedom, that they could get through the next Congress.",1960-09-26,Republican
Mr. Smith,The next question to Vice President Nixon fa- from Mr. Fleming.,1960-09-26,Moderator
Mr. Fleming,"Mr. Vice President, do I take it then you believe that you can work better with Democratic majorities in the House and Senate than Senator Kennedy could work with Democratic majorities in the House and Senate? MR. NIXON; I would say this: that we, of course, expect to pick up some seats in both in the House and the Senate. Uh  We would hope to control the House, to get a majority in the House uh  in this election. We cannot, of course, control the Senate. I would say that a president will be able to lead  a president will be able to get his program through  to the effect that he has the support of the country, the support of the people. Sometimes we  we get the opinion that in getting programs through the House or the Senate its purely a question of legislative finagling and all that sort of thing. It isnt really that. Whenever a majority of the people are for a program, the House and the Senate responds to it. And whether this House and Senate, in the next session is Democratic or Republican, if the country will have voted for the candidate for the presidency and for the proposals that he has made, I believe that you will find that the president, if it were a Republican, as it would be in my case, would be able to get his program through that Congress. Now, I also say that as far as Senator Kennedys proposals are concerned, that, again, the question is not simply one of uh  a presidential veto stopping programs. You must always remember that a president cant stop anything unless he has the people behind him. And the reason President Eisenhowers vetoes have been sustained  the reason the Congress does not send up bills to him which they think will be vetoed  is because the people and the Congress, the majority of them, know the country is behind the President.",1960-09-26,Moderator
Mr. Smith,Senator Kennedy.,1960-09-26,Moderator
Mr. Kennedy,"Well, now lets look at these bills that the Vice President suggests were too extreme. One was a bill for a dollar twenty-five cents an hour for anyone who works in a store or company that has a million dollars a year business. I dont think thats extreme at all; and yet nearly two-thirds to three-fourths of the Republicans in the House of Representatives voted against that proposal. Secondly was the federal aid to education bill. It  it was a very uh  because of the defeat of teacher salaries, it was not a bill that uh  met in my opinion the need. The fact of the matter is it was a bill that was less than you recommended, Mr. Nixon, this morning in your proposal. It was not an extreme bill and yet we could not get one Republican to join, at least I think four of the eight Democrats voted to send it to the floor of the House  not one Republican  and they joined with those Democrats who were opposed to it. I dont say the Democrats are united in their support of the program. But I do say a majority are. And I say a majority of the Republicans are opposed to it. The third is medical care for the aged which is tied to Social Security, which is financed out of Social Security funds. It does not put a deficit on the Treasury. The proposal advanced by you and by Mr. Javits would have cost six hundred millions of dollars  Mr. Rockefeller rejected it in New York, said he didnt agree with the financing at all, said it ought to be on Social Security. So these are three programs which are quite moderate. I think it shows the difference between the two parties. One party is ready to move in these programs. The other party gives them lip service.",1960-09-26,Democrat
Mr. Smith,Mr. Warrens question for Senator Kennedy.,1960-09-26,Moderator
Mr. Warren,"Senator Kennedy, on another subject, Communism is so often described as an ideology or a belief that exists somewhere other than in the United States. Let me ask you, sir: just how serious a threat to our national security are these Communist subversive activities in the United States today?",1960-09-26,Moderator
Mr. Kennedy,"Well, I think theyre serious. I think its a matter that we should continue to uh  give uh  great care and attention to. We should support uh  the laws which the United States has passed in order to protect us from uh  those who would destroy us from within. We should sustain uh  the Department of Justice in its efforts and the F.B.I., and we should be continually alert. I think if the United States is maintaining a strong society here in the United States, I think that we can meet any internal threat. The major threat is external and will continue.",1960-09-26,Democrat
Mr. Smith,"Mr. Nixon, comment?",1960-09-26,Moderator
Mr. Nixon,"I agree with Senator Kennedys appraisal generally in this respect. The question of Communism within the United States has been one that has worried us in the past. It is one that will continue to be a problem for years to come. We have to remember that the cold war that Mr. Khrushchev is waging and his colleagues are waging, is waged all over the world and its waged right here in the United States. Thats why we have to continue to be alert. It is also essential in being alert that we be fair; fair because by being fair we uphold the very freedoms that the Communists would destroy. We uphold the standards of conduct which they would never follow. And, in this connection, I think that uh  we must look to the future having in mind the fact that we fight Communism at home not only by our laws to deal with Communists uh  the few who do become Communists and the few who do become tra- fellow travelers, but we also fight Communism at home by moving against those various injustices which exist in our society which the Communists feed upon. And in that connection I again would say that while Senator Kennedy says we are for the status quo, I do believe that he uh  would agree that I am just as sincere in believing that my proposals for federal aid to education, my proposals for health care are just as sincerely held as his. The question again is not one of goals  were for those goals  its one of means.",1960-09-26,Republican
Mr. Smith,Mr. Vanocurs question for Vice President Nixon.,1960-09-26,Moderator
Mr. Vanocur,"Mr. Vice President uh  in one of your earlier statements you said weve moved ahead, weve built more schools, weve built more hospitals. Now, sir, isnt it true that the building of more schools is a local matter for financing? Uh  Were you claiming that the Eisenhower Administration was responsible for the building of these schools, or is it the local school districts that provide for it?",1960-09-26,Moderator
Mr. Nixon,"Not at all. As a matter of fact your question brings out a point that I am very glad to make. Too often in appraising whether we are moving ahead or not we think only of what the federal government is doing. Now that isnt the test of whether America moves. The test of whether America moves is whether the federal government, plus the state government, plus the local government, plus the biggest segment of all  individual enterprise  moves. We have for example a gross national product of approximately five hundred billion dollars. Roughly a hundred billion to a hundred and a quarter billion of that is the result of government activity. Four hundred billion, approximately, is a result of what individuals do. Now, the reason the Eisenhower Administration has moved, the reason that weve had the funds, for example, locally to build the schools, and the hospitals, and the highways, to make the progress that we have, is because this Administration has encouraged individual enterprise; and it has resulted in the greatest expansion of the private sector of the economy that has ever been witnessed in an eight-year period. And that is growth. That is the growth that we are looking for; it is the growth that this Administration has supported and that its policies have stimulated.",1960-09-26,Republican
Mr. Smith,Senator Kennedy.,1960-09-26,Moderator
Mr. Kennedy,"Well, I must say that the reason that the schools have been constructed is because the local school districts were willing to increase the property taxes to a tremendously high figure  in my opinion, almost to the point of diminishing returns in order to sustain these schools. Secondly, I think we have a rich uh  country. And I think we have a powerful country. I think what we have to do, however, is have the president and the leadership set before our country exactly what we must do in the next decade, if were going to maintain our security in education, in economic growth, in development of natural resources. The Soviet Union is making great gains. It isnt enough to compare what might have been done eight years ago, or ten years ago, or fifteen years ago, or twenty years ago. I want to compare what were doing with what our adversaries are doing, so that by the year 1970 the United States is ahead in education, in health, in building, in homes, in economic strength. I think thats the big assignment, the big task, the big function of the federal government.",1960-09-26,Democrat
Mr. Smith,"Can I have the summation time please? Weve completed our questions and our comments, and in just a moment, well have the summation time.",1960-09-26,Moderator
Mr. Nixon,"Thank you, Mr. Smith. Senator Kennedy. First of all, I think it is well to put in perspective where we really do stand with regard to the Soviet Union in this whole matter of growth. The Soviet Union has been moving faster than we have. But the reason for that is obvious. They start from a much lower base. Although they have been moving faster in growth than we have, we find, for example, today that their total gross national product is only forty-four per cent of our total gross national product. Thats the same percentage that it was twenty years ago. And as far as the absolute gap is concerned, we find that the United States is even further ahead than it was twenty years ago. Is this any reason for complacency? Not at all Because these are determined men. They are fanatical men. And we have to get the very most of uh  out uh  out of our economy. I agree with Senator Kennedy completely on that score. Where we disagree is in the means that we would use to get the most out of our economy. I respectfully submit that Senator Kennedy too often would rely too much on the federal government, on what it would do to solve our problems, to stimulate growth. I believe that when we examine the Democratic platform, when we examine the proposals that he has discussed tonight, when we compare them with the proposals that I have made, that these proposals that he makes would not result in greater growth for this country than would be the case if we followed the programs that I have advocated. There are many of the points that he has made that I would like to comment upon. The one in the field of health is worth mentioning. Our health program  the one that Senator Javits and other Republican Senators, as well as I supported  is one that provides for all people over sixty-five who want health insurance, the opportunity to have it if they want it. It provides a choice of having either government insurance or private insurance. But it compels nobody to have insurance who does not want it. His program under Social Security, would require everybody who had Social Security to take government health insurance whether he wanted it or not. And it would not cover several million people who are not covered by Social Security at all. Here is one place where I think that our program does a better job than his. The other point that I would make is this: this downgrading of how much things cost I think many of our people will understand better when they look at what happened when  during the Truman Administration when the government was spending more than it took in  we found savings over a lifetime eaten up by inflation. We found the people who could least afford it  people on retired incomes uh  people on fixed incomes  we found them unable to meet their bills at the end of the month. It is essential that a man whos president of this country certainly stand for every program that will mean for growth. And I stand for programs that will mean growth and progress. But it is also essential that he not allow a dollar spent that could be better spent by the people themselves.",1960-09-26,Republican
Mr. Smith,"Senator Kennedy, your conclusion.",1960-09-26,Moderator
Mr. Kennedy,"The point was made by Mr. Nixon that the Soviet production is only forty-four percent of ours. I must say that forty-four percent and that Soviet country is causing us a good deal of trouble tonight. I want to make sure that it stays in that relationship. I dont want to see the day when its sixty percent of ours, and seventy and seventy-five and eighty and ninety percent of ours, with all the force and power that it could bring to bear in order to cause our destruction. Secondly, the Vice President mentioned medical care for the aged. Our program was an amendment to the Kerr bill. The Kerr bill provided assistance to all those who were not on Social Security. I think its a very clear contrast. In 1935, when the Social Security Act was written, ninety-four out of ninety-five Republicans voted against it. Mr. Landon ran in 1936 to repeal it. In August of 1960, when we tried to get it again, but this time for medical care, we received the support of one Republican in the Senate on this occasion. Thirdly, I think the question before the American people is: as they look at this country and as they look at the world around them, the goals are the same for all Americans. The means are at question. The means are at issue. If you feel that everything that is being done now is satisfactory, that the relative power and prestige and strength of the United States is increasing in relation to that of the Communists; that weve b- gaining more security, that we are achieving everything as a nation that we should achieve, that we are achieving a better life for our citizens and greater strength, then I agree. I think you should vote for Mr. Nixon. But if you feel that we have to move again in the sixties, that the function of the president is to set before the people the unfinished business of our society as Franklin Roosevelt did in the thirties, the agenda for our people  what we must do as a society to meet our needs in this country and protect our security and help the cause of freedom. As I said at the beginning, the question before us all, that faces all Republicans and all Democrats, is: can freedom in the next generation conquer, or are the Communists going to be successful? Thats the great issue. And if we meet our responsibilities I think freedom will conquer. If we fail, if we fail to move ahead, if we fail to develop sufficient military and economic and social strength here in this country, then I think that uh  the tide could begin to run against us. And I dont want historians, ten years from now, to say, these were the years when the tide ran out for the United States. I want them to say these were the years when the tide came in; these were the years when the United States started to move again. Thats the question before the American people, and only you can decide what you want, what you want this country to be, what you want to do with the future. I think were ready to move. And it is to that great task, if were successful, that we will address ourselves.",1960-09-26,Democrat

Welcome to this second election 2000 debate between the Republican candidate for president, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, and the Democratic candidate, Vice President Al Gore. These debates are sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates. The format and the rules are those negotiated by representatives of the two campaigns. Only the subjects tonight and the questions are mine. The format tonight is that of a conversation. The only prevailing rule is that no single response can ever, ever exceed two minutes. The prevailing rule for the audience here in the hall is as always, absolute quiet, please. Good evening, Governor Bush, Vice President Gore. The end of our 90 minutes last week in Boston, the total time each of you took was virtually the same. Lets see if we can do the same tonight, or come close. Governor Bush, the first question goes to you. One of you is about to be elected the leader of the single-most powerful nation in the world, economically, financially, militarily, diplomatically, you name it. Have you formed any guiding principles for exercising this enormous power?",2000-10-11,Moderator
Bush,"I have, I have. First question is whats in the best interests of the United States? Whats in the best interests of our people? When it comes to foreign policy that will be my guiding question. Is it in our nations interests? Peace in the Middle East is in our nations interests. Having a hemisphere that is free for trade and peaceful is in our nations interests. Strong relations in Europe is in our nations interest. Ive thought a lot about what it means to be the president. I also understand that an administration is not one person, but an administration is dedicated citizens who are called by the president to serve the country, to serve a cause greater than self, and so Ive thought about an administration of people who represent all America, but people who understand my compassionate and conservative philosophy. I havent started naming names except for one person, and thats Mr. Richard Cheney who I thought did a great job the other night. Hes a vice presidential nominee who represents  I think people got to see why I picked him. Hes man of solid judgment and hes going to be a person to stand by my side. One of the things Ive done in Texas is Ive been able to put together a good team of people. Ive been able to set clear goals. The goals ought to be an education system that leaves no child behind, Medicare for our seniors, a Social Security system thats safe and secure, foreign policy thats in our nations interest, and a strong military, and then bring people together to achieve those goals. Thats what a Chief Executive Officer does. So Ive thought long and hard about the honor of being the President of the United States.",2000-10-11,Republican
Moderator,Vice President Gore?,2000-10-11,Moderator
Gore,"Yes, Jim. Ive thought a lot about that particular question, and I see our greatest national strength coming from what we stand for in the world. I see it as a question of values. It is a great tribute to our founders that 224 years later this nation is now looked to by the peoples on every other continent and the peoples from every part of this earth as a kind of model for what their future could be. And I dont think thats just the kind of exaggeration that we take pride in as Americans. Its really true, even the ones that sometimes shake their fists at us. As soon as they have a change that allows the people to speak freely, theyre wanting to develop some kind of blueprint that will help them be like us more, freedom, free markets, political freedom. So I think first and foremost our power ought to be wielded to in ways that form a more perfect union. The power of example is Americas greatest power in the world. And that means, for example, standing up for human rights. It means addressing the problems of injustice and inequity, along the lines of race and ethnicity here at home, because in all these other places around the world where theyre having these terrible problems, when they feel hope, it is often because they see in us a reflection of their potential. So weve got to enforce our civil rights laws. Weve got to deal with things like racial profiling. And we have to keep our military strong. We have the strongest military, and Ill do whatever is necessary, if Im president, to make sure that it stays that way. But our real power comes, I think, from our values.",2000-10-11,Democrat
Moderator,"Should the people of the world look at the United States, Governor, and say, should they fear us, should they welcome our involvement, should they see us as a friend, everybody in the world? How would you project us around the world, as president?",2000-10-11,Moderator
Bush,"Well, I think they ought to look at us as a country that understands freedom where it doesnt matter who you are or how youre raised or where youre from, that you can succeed. I dont think theyll look at us with envy. It really depends upon how our nation conducts itself in foreign policy. If were an arrogant nation, theyll resent us. If were a humble nation, but strong, theyll welcome us. And its  our nation stands alone right now in the world in terms of power, and thats why we have to be humble. And yet project strength in a way that promotes freedom. So I dont think they ought to look at us in any way other than what we are. Were a freedom-loving nation and if were an arrogant nation theyll view us that way, but if were a humble nation theyll respect us.",2000-10-11,Republican
Moderator,A humble nation.,2000-10-11,Moderator
Gore,"I agree with that. I agree with that. I think that one of the problems that we have faced in the world is that we are so much more powerful than any single nation has been in relationship to the rest of the world than at any time in history, that I know about, anyway. That there is some resentment of U.S. power. So I think that the idea of humility is an important one. But I think that we also have to have a sense of mission in the world. We have to protect our capacity to push forward what Americas all about. That means not only military strength and our values, it also means keeping our economy strong. You know, in the last, or two decades ago, it was routine for leaders of foreign countries to come over here and say you guys have got to do something about these horrendous deficits because its causing tremendous problems for the rest of the world, and we were lectured to all the time. The fact that we have the strongest economy in history today is not good enough. We need to do more. But the fact that it is so strong enables us to project the power for good that America can represent.",2000-10-11,Democrat
Moderator,"Does that give us  does our wealth, our good economy, our power, bring with it special obligations to the rest of the world?",2000-10-11,Moderator
Bush,"Yes, it does. Take, for example, Third World debt. I think we ought to be forgiving Third World debt under certain conditions. I think, for example, if were convinced that a Third World country thats got a lot of debt would reform itself, that the money wouldnt go into the hands of a few but would go to help people, I think it makes sense for us to use our wealth in that way, or to trade debt for valuable rain forest lands, makes that much sense, yes. We do have an obligation, but we cant be all things to all people. We can help build coalitions but we cant put our troops all around the world. We can lend money but we have to do it wisely. We shouldnt be lending money to corrupt officials. So we got to be guarded in our generosity.",2000-10-11,Republican
Moderator,"Lets go through some of the specifics now. New question. Vice President Gore, the governor mentioned the Middle East. Here were talking at this stage in the game about diplomatic power that we have. What do you think the United States should do right now to resolve that conflict over there?",2000-10-11,Moderator
Gore,"The first priority has to be on ending the violence, dampening down the tensions that have arisen there. We need to call upon Syria to release the three Israeli soldiers who have been captured. We need to insist that Arafat send out instructions to halt some of the provocative acts of violence that have been going on. I think that we also have to keep a weather eye toward Saddam Hussein because he is taking advantage of this situation to once again make threats, and he needs to understand that hes not only dealing with Israel, he is dealing  hes dealing with us if he is making the kind of threats that hes talking about there. The use of diplomacy in this situation has already, well, it goes hour-by-hour and day-by-day now. Its a very tense situation there. But in the last 24 hours there has been some subsiding of the violence there. Its too much to hope that this is going to continue, but I do hope that it will continue. Our country has been very active with regular conversations with the leaders there. And we just have to take it day-to-day right now. But one thing I would say where diplomacy is concerned, Israel should feel absolutely secure about one thing. Our bonds with Israel are larger than agreements or disagreements on some details of diplomatic initiatives. They are historic, they are strong, and they are enduring. And our ability to serve as an honest broker is something that we need to shepherd.",2000-10-11,Democrat
Moderator,Governor?,2000-10-11,Moderator
Bush,"Well, I think during the campaign, particularly now during this difficult period, we ought to be speaking with one voice, and I appreciate the way the administration has worked hard to calm the tensions. Like the vice president, I call on Chairman Arafat to have his people pull back to make the peace. I think credibility is going to be very important in the future in the Middle East. I want everybody to know should I be the president Israels going to be our friend. Im going to stand by Israel. Secondly, that I think its important to reach out to moderate Arab nations, like Jordan and Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. Its important to be friends with people when you dont need each other so that when you do theres a strong bond of friendship. And thats going to be particularly important in dealing not only with situations such as now occurring in Israel, but with Saddam Hussein. The coalition against Saddam has fallen apart or its unraveling, lets put it that way. The sanctions are being violated. We dont know whether hes developing weapons of mass destruction. He better not be or theres going to be a consequence should I be the president. But its important to have credibility and credibility is formed by being strong with your friends and resolute in your determination. One of the reasons why I think its important for this nation to develop an anti-ballistic missile system that we can share with our allies in the Middle East if need be to keep the peace to be able to say to the Saddam Husseins of the world or the Iranians, dont dare threaten our friends. Its also important to keep strong ties in the Middle East, credible ties, because of the energy crisis were now in. After all, a lot of the energy is produced from the Middle East, and so I appreciate what the administration is doing. I hope to get a sense of should I be fortunate to be the president how my administration will react to the Middle East.",2000-10-11,Republican
Moderator,"So you dont believe, Vice President Gore, that we should take sides and resolve this right now? A lot of people pushing hey, the United States should declare itself and not be so neutral in this particular situation.",2000-10-11,Moderator
Gore,"Well, we stand with Israel, but we have maintained the ability to serve as an honest broker. And one of the reasons thats important is that Israel cannot have direct dialogue with some of the people on the other side of conflicts, especially during times of tension, unless that dialogue comes through us. And if we throw away that ability to serve as an honest broker, then we have thrown  we will have thrown away a strategic asset thats important not only to us but also to Israel.",2000-10-11,Democrat
Moderator,"You agree with that, Governor?",2000-10-11,Moderator
Bush,"I do. I do think this, though. When it comes to timetables it cant be the United States timetable as to how discussions take place. Its got to be a timetable that all parties can agree to, like the Palestinians and Israelis. Secondly, any lasting peace is going to have to be a peace thats good for both sides. And therefore, the term honest broker makes sense. This current administrations worked hard to keep the parties at the table. I will try to do the same thing. But it wont be on my timetable, it will be on the timetable that people are comfortable with in the Middle East.",2000-10-11,Republican

Bush,"I would like to, of course, and I presume this administration would as well. We dont know  there are no inspectors now in Iraq, the coalition that was in place isnt as strong as it used to be. He is a danger. We dont want him fishing in troubled waters in the Middle East.

Bush,I do.,2000-10-11,Republican
Gore,"Well, when I got to be a part of the current administration, it was right after  I was one of the few members of my political party to support former President Bush in the Persian Gulf War resolution, and at the end of that war, for whatever reason, it was not finished in a way that removed Saddam Hussein from power. I know there are all kinds of circumstances and explanations. But the fact is that thats the situation that was left when I got there. And we have maintained the sanctions. Now I want to go further. I want to give robust support to the groups that are trying to overthrow Saddam Hussein, and I know there are allegations that theyre too weak to do it, but thats what they said about the forces that were opposing Milosevic in Serbia, and you know, the policy of enforcing sanctions against Serbia has just resulted in a spectacular victory for democracy just in the past week, and it seems to me that having taken so long to see the sanctions work there, building upon the policy of containment that was successful over a much longer period of time against the former Soviet Union in the communist block, seems a little early to declare that we should give up on the sanctions. I know the governors not necessarily saying that but, you know, all of these flights that have come in, all of them have been in accordance with the sanctions regime, Im told, except for three where they notified, and theyre trying to break out of the box, theres no question about it. I dont think they should be allowed to.",2000-10-11,Democrat

Moderator,"Lets go on to Milosevic and Yugoslavia, and it falls under the area of our military power. Governor, new question. Should the fall of Milosevic be seen as a triumph for U.S. military intervention?",2000-10-11,Moderator
Bush,"I think its a triumph. I thought the president made the right decision in joining NATO and bombing Serbia. I supported them when they did so. I called upon the Congress not to hamstring the administration, and in terms of forcing troop withdrawals on a timetable that wasnt necessarily in our best interest or fit our nations strategy, and so I think its good public policy, I think it worked, and Im pleased I took  made the decision I made. Im pleased the president made the decision he made. Because freedom took hold in that part of the world, but theres a lot of work left to be done, however.",2000-10-11,Republican
Moderator,But you think it would not have happened  do you think that Milosevic would not have fallen if the United States and NATO had not intervened militarily? Is this a legitimate use of our military power?,2000-10-11,Moderator
Bush,"Yes, I think it is. Absolutely. I dont think he would have fallen had we not used the force. And I know there are some in our party that disagree with that sentiment. I supported the president. I thought he made the right decision to do so. I didnt think he necessarily made the right decision to take land troops off the table right before we committed ourselves offensively, but nevertheless, it worked. The administration deserves credit for having made it work. It is important for NATO to have it work. Its important for NATO to be strong and confident and to help keep the peace in Europe. And one of the reasons I felt so strongly that the United States needed to participate was because of our relations with NATO, and NATO is going to be an important part of keeping the peace in the future. Now, theres more work to do. Remains to be seen, however, whether or not theres going to be a political settlement in Kosovo, and I certainly hope there is one. Im on record as saying at some point in time I hope our European friends become the peacekeepers in Bosnia and in the Balkans. I hope that they put the troops on the ground so that we can withdraw our troops and focus our military on fighting and winning war.",2000-10-11,Republican
Gore,"Well, Ive been kind of a hard-liner on this issue for more than eight years. When I was in the senate before I became vice president I was pushing for stronger action against Milosevic. He caused the death of so many people. He was the last communist party boss there and then he became a dictator that by some other label he was still essentially a communist dictator. And unfortunately now he is trying to reassert himself in Serbian politics. Already just today the members of his political party said that they were going to ignore the orders of the new president of Serbia, and that they question his legitimacy, and hes still going to try to be actively involved. He is an indicted war criminal. He should be held accountable. Now, I did want to pick up on one of the statements earlier, and maybe I have heard, maybe I have heard the previous statements wrong, Governor. In some of the discussions weve had about when its appropriate for the U.S. to use force around the world, at times the standards that youve laid down have given me the impression that if its something like a genocide taking place or what they called ethnic cleansing in Bosnia, that that alone would not be, that that wouldnt be the kind of situation that would cause you to think that the U.S. ought to get involved with troops. Now, have to be other factors involved for me to want to be involved. But by itself, that to me can bring into play a fundamental American strategic interest because I think its based on our values. Now, have I got that wrong?",2000-10-11,Democrat
Bush,"Trying to figure out who the questioner was. If I think its in our nations strategic interest Ill commit troops. I thought it was in our strategic interests to keep Milosevic in check because of our relations in NATO, and thats why I took the position I took. I think its important for NATO to be strong and confident. I felt like unchecked Milosevic would harm NATO, and so it depends on the situation, Mr. Vice President.",2000-10-11,Republican
Moderator,"Well, lets stay on the subject for a moment. New question related to this. I figured this out; in the last 20 years there have been eight major actions that involved the introduction of U.S. ground, air or naval forces. Let me name them. Lebanon, Grenada, Panama, the Persian Gulf, Somalia, Bosnia, Haiti, Kosovo. If you had been president for any of those interventions, would any of those interventions not have happened?",2000-10-11,Moderator

I think our troops ought to be used to help overthrow the dictator when its in our best interests. But in this case it was a nation-building exercise, and same with Haiti.

Moderator,"I do, I do. The Persian Gulf, obviously. And Bosnia. And you have already talked about Kosovo. But the reverse side of the question, Governor, that Vice President Gore mentioned, 600,000 people died in Rwanda in 1994. There was no U.S. intervention, no intervention from the outside world. Was that a mistake not to intervene?",2000-10-11,Moderator
Bush,"I think the administration did the right thing in that case. I do. It was a horrible situation, no one liked to see it on our TV screens, but its a case where we need to make sure we have an early warning system in place in places where there could be ethnic cleansing and genocide the way we saw it there in Rwanda. And thats a case where we need to use our influence to have countries in Africa come together and help deal with the situation. The administration, seems like were having a great love fest tonight, but the administration made the right decision on training Nigerian troops for situations just such as this in Rwanda, and so I thought they made the right decision not to send U.S. troops into Rwanda.",2000-10-11,Republican
Moderator,"Do you have any second thoughts on that, based on what you said a moment ago about genocide?",2000-10-11,Moderator
Gore,"Id like to come back to the question of nation building, but let me address the question directly, first. Fine. We did, actually, send troops into Rwanda to help with the humanitarian relief measures. My wife Tipper, who is here, actually went on a military plane with General Sholicatchvieli on one of those flights. But I think in retrospect we were too late getting in there. We could have saved more lives if we had acted earlier. But I do not think that it was an example of a conflict where we should have put our troops in to try to separate the parties for this reason, Jim. One of the criteria that I think is important in deciding when and if we should ever get involved around the world is whether or not our national security interest is involved, if we can really make the difference with military forces. If we tried everything else, if we have allies. In the Balkans we have allies, NATO, ready, willing and able to go and carry a big part of the burden. In Africa we did not. Now, we have tried  our country has tried to create an Africa crisis response team there, and weve met some resistance. We have had some luck with Nigeria, but in Sierra Leon, and now that Nigeria has become a democracy, and we hope it stays that way, then maybe we can build on that. But because we had no allies and because it was very unclear that we could actually accomplish what we would want to accomplish about putting military forces there, I think it was the right thing not to jump in, as heartbreaking as it was, but I think we should have come in much quicker with the humanitarian mission.",2000-10-11,Democrat
Moderator,"So what would you say, Governor, that somebody would say hey wait a minute, why not Africa, I mean why the Middle East, why the Balkans, but not Africa, when 600,000 peoples lives are at risk?",2000-10-11,Moderator
Bush,"Well, I understand, and Africa is important. And weve got to do a lot of work in Africa to promote democracy and trade, and there are some  Vice President mentioned Nigeria is a fledgling democracy. We have to work with Nigeria. Its an important continent. But theres got to be priorities, and Middle East is a priority for a lot of reasons, as is Europe and the Far East, our own hemisphere. And those are my four top priorities should I be the president, not to say we wont be engaged nor work hard to get other nations to come together to prevent atrocity. I thought the best example of a way to handle the situation was East Timor when we provided logistical support to the Australians, support that only we can provide. I thought that was a good model. But we cant be all things to all people in the world, Jim. And I think thats where maybe the vice president and I begin to have some differences. Im worried about overcommitting our military around the world. I want to be judicious in its use. You mentioned Haiti. I wouldnt have sent troops to Haiti. I didnt think it was a mission worthwhile. It was a nation building mission, and it was not very successful. It cost us billions, a couple billions of dollars, and Im not so sure democracy is any better off in Haiti than it was before.",2000-10-11,Republican
Moderator,"Vice President Gore, do you agree with the governors views on nation building, the use of military, our military, for nation building as he described and defined it?",2000-10-11,Moderator
Gore,"I dont think we agree on that. I would certainly also be judicious in evaluating any potential use of American troops overseas. I think we have to be very reticent about that. But look, Jim, the world is changing so rapidly. The way I see it, the world is getting much closer together. Like it or not, we are now  the United States is now the natural leader of the world. All these other countries are looking to us. Now, just because we cannot be involved everywhere, and shouldnt be, doesnt mean that we should shy away from going in anywhere. Now, both of us are kind of, I guess, stating the others position in a maximalist extreme way, but I think there is a difference here. This idea of nation building is kind of a pejorative phrase, but think about the great conflict of the past century, World War II. During the years between World War I and World War II, a great lesson was learned by our military leaders and the people of the United States. The lesson was that in the aftermath of World War I, we kind of turned our backs and left them to their own devices and they brewed up a lot of trouble that quickly became World War II. And acting upon that lesson in the aftermath of our great victory in World War II, we laid down the Marshall Plan, President Truman did. We got intimately involved in building NATO and other structures there. We still have lots of troops in Europe. And what did we do in the late 40s and 50s and 60s? We were nation building. And it was economic. But it was also military. And the confidence that those countries recovering from the wounds of war had by having troops there. We had civil administrators come in to set up their ways of building their towns back.",2000-10-11,Democrat
Moderator,"You said in the Boston debate, Governor, on this issue of nation building, that the United States military is overextended now. Where is it overextended? Where are there U.S. military that you would bring home if you become president?",2000-10-11,Moderator
Bush,"First let me just say one comment about what the vice president said. I think one of the lessons in between World War I and World War II is we let our military atrophy. And we cant do that. Weve got to rebuild our military. But one of the problems we have in the military is were in a lot of places around the world. And I mentioned one, and thats the Balkans. I would very much like to get our troops out of there. I recognize we cant do it now, nor do I advocate an immediate withdrawal. That would be an abrogation of our agreement with NATO. No one is suggesting that. But I think it ought to be one of our priorities to work with our European friends to convince them to put troops on the ground. And there is an example. Haiti is another example. Now there are some places where I think  you know, Ive supported the administration in Columbia. I think its important for us to be training Columbians in that part of the world. The hemisphere is in our interest to have a peaceful Columbia. But",2000-10-11,Republican
Moderator,"The use of the military, there  some people are now suggesting that if you dont want to use the military to maintain the peace, to do the civil thing, is it time to consider a civil force of some kind that comes in after the military that builds nations or all of that? Is that on your radar screen?",2000-10-11,Moderator
Bush,"I dont think so. I think what we need to do is convince people who live in the lands they live in to build the nations. Maybe Im missing something here. I mean, were going to have kind of a nation building core from America? Absolutely not. Our military is meant to fight and win war. Thats what its meant to do. And when it gets overextended, morale drops. I strongly believe we need to have a military presence in the Korean peninsula, not only to keep the peace in the peninsula, but to keep regional stability. And I strongly believe we need to keep a presence in NATO, but Im going to be judicious as to how to use the military. It needs to be in our vital interest, the mission needs to be clear, and the extra strategy obvious.",2000-10-11,Republican
Gore,"I dont disagree with that. I certainly dont disagree that we ought to get our troops home from places like the Balkans as soon as we can, as soon as the mission is complete. Thats what we did in Haiti. There are no more than a handful of American military personnel in Haiti now. And Haitians have their problems, but we gave them a chance to restore democracy. Thats really about all we can do. But if you have a situation like that right in our backyard with chaos about to break out and flotillas forming to come across the water, and all kinds of violence there, right in one of our neighboring countries there, then I think that we did the right thing there. And as for this idea of nation building, the phrase sounds grandiose. And, you know, we cant be  we cant allow ourselves to get overextended. I certainly agree with that. And thats why Ive supported building up our capacity. Ive devoted in the budget Ive proposed, as I said last week, more than twice as much as the governor has proposed. I think that its in better shape now than he generally does. Weve had some disagreements about that. He said that two divisions would have to report not ready for duty, and thats not what the joint chiefs say. But theres no doubt that we have to continue building up readiness and military strength. And we have to also be very cautious in the way we use our military.",2000-10-11,Democrat

Bush,"Thats a place where we can use our generosity to influence in a positive way, influence nations. I believe we ought to have foreign aid, but I dont think we ought to just have foreign aid for the sake of foreign aid. I think foreign aid needs to be used to encourage markets and reform. I think a lot of times we just spend aid and say we feel better about it and it ends up being spent the wrong way, and theres some pretty egregious examples recently. One being Russia, where we had IMF loans that ended up in the pockets of a lot of powerful people and didnt help the nation. I think the IMF has got a role in the world, but I dont want to see the IMF out there as a way to say to world bankers, if you make a bad loan, well bail you out. It needs to be available for emergency situations. I thought the President did the right thing with Mexico and was very strongly supportive of the administration in Mexico. But I dont think the IMF ought to be a stop loss for people who ought to be able to evaluate risks themselves. So Ill look at every place where were investing money. I just want to make sure the return is good.",2000-10-11,Republican
Moderator,Do you think were meeting our obligations properly?,2000-10-11,Moderator
Gore,"No, I would make some changes. I think there need to be reforms in the IMF. Ive generally supported it, but Ive seen them make some calls that I thought were highly questionable. And I think that theres a general agreement in many parts of the world now that there ought to be changes in the IMF. The World Bank I think is generally doing a better job, but I think one of the big issues here that doesnt get nearly enough attention is the issue of corruption. The governor mentioned it earlier. Ive worked on this issue. Its an enormous problem and corruption in official agencies, like militaries and police departments around the world, customs officials, thats one of the worst forms of it. And we have got to again lead by example and help these other countries that are trying to straighten out their situations find the tools in order to do it. I just think, Jim, that this is an absolutely unique period in world history. The worlds coming together, as I said, theyre looking to us. And we have a fundamental choice to make. Are we going to step up to the plate as a nation the way we did after World War II, the way that generation of heroes said okay, the United States is going to be the leader. And the world benefitted tremendously from the courage that they showed in those post-war years. I think that in the aftermath of the Cold War, its time for us to do something very similar, to step up to the plate, to provide the leadership on the environment, leadership to make sure the world economy keeps moving in the right direction. Again, that means not running big deficits here and not squandering our surplus. It means having intelligent decisions that keep our prosperity going and shepherds that economic strength so that we can provide that leadership role.",2000-10-11,Democrat
Bush,"Let me comment on that. Im not so sure the role of the United States is to go around the world and say this is the way its got to be. We can help. And maybe its just our difference in government, the way we view government. I want to empower the people. I want to help people help themselves, not have government tell people what to do. I just dont think its the role of the United States to walk into a country and say, we do it this way, so should you. I think we can help. I know weve got to encourage democracy in the marketplaces. But take Russia, for example. We went into Russia, we said here is some IMF money, and it ended up in Viktor Chemomyrdins pocket, and others, and yet we played like there was reform. The only people that are going to reform Russia are Russia. Theyre going to have to make the decision themselves. Mr. Putin is going to have to make the decision as to whether or not he wants to adhere to rule of law and normal accounting practices so that if countries and/or entities invest capital, theres a reasonable rate of return, a way to get the money out of the economy. But Russia has to make the decision. We can work with them on security matters, for example, but its their call to make. So Im not exactly sure where the vice president is coming from, but I think one way for us to end up being viewed as the ugly American is for us to go around the world saying, we do it this way, so should you. Now, we trust freedom. We know freedom is a powerful, powerful, powerful force, much bigger than the United States of America, as we saw recently in the Balkans. But maybe I misunderstand where youre coming from, Mr. Vice President, but I think the United States must be humble and must be proud and confident of our values, but humble in how we treat nations that are figuring out how to chart their own course.",2000-10-11,Republican

Moderator,"First, a couple of follow-ups from the vice presidential debate last week. Vice President Gore, would you support or sign, as president, a federal law banning racial profiling by police and other authorities at all levels of government?",2000-10-11,Moderator
Gore,"Yes, I would. The only thing an executive order can accomplish is to ban it in federal law enforcement agencies, but I would also support a law in the Congress that would have the effect of doing the same thing. I just  I think that racial profiling is a serious problem. I remember when the stories first came out about the stops in New Jersey by the highway patrol there. And I know its been going on a long time. In some ways this is just a new label for something that has been going on for years. But I have to confess that it was the first time that I really focused on it in a new way. And I was surprised at the extent of it. And I think weve now got so many examples around the country that we really have to find ways to end this. Imagine what it  what it is like for someone to be singled out unfairly, unjustly, and feel the unfair force of law simply because of race or ethnicity. Now, that runs counter to what the United States of America is all about at our core. And its not an easy problem to solve. But if I am entrusted with the presidency, it will be the first Civil Rights Act of the 21st century.",2000-10-11,Democrat
Bush,"Yeah, I cant imagine what it would be like to be singled out because of race and stopped and harassed. Thats just flat wrong, and thats not what America is all about. And so we ought to do everything we can to end racial profiling. One of my concerns, though, is I dont want to federalize the local police forces. I want to  obviously in the egregious cases we need to enforce civil rights law, but we need to make sure that internal affairs divisions at the local level do their job and be given a chance to do their job. I believe in local control of governments, and obviously if they dont there needs to be a consequence at the federal level. But its very important that we not overstep our bounds and I think most people  most police officers are good, dedicated, honorable citizens who are doing their job, putting their lives at risk who arent bigoted or arent prejudiced. I dont think they ought to be held guilty. But I do think we need to find out where racial profiling occurs and do something about it and say to the local folks, get it done. And if you cant, there will be a federal consequence.",2000-10-11,Republican

Bush,Yeah.,2000-10-11,Republican
Moderator,And you would agree?,2000-10-11,Moderator
Gore,"I would agree. And I also agree that most police officers, of course, are doing a good job and hate this practice also. I talked to an African-American police officer in Springfield, Massachusetts not long ago who raised this question and said that in his opinion one of the biggest solutions is in the training. And not only the training in police procedures, but human relations. And I think that racial profiling is part of a larger issue of how we deal with race in America. And as for singling people out because of race, you know, James Byrd was singled out because of his race in Texas. And other Americans have been singled out because of their race or ethnicity. And thats why I think we can embody our values by passing a hate crimes law. I think these crimes are different. I think theyre different because theyre based on prejudice and hatred, which gives rise to crimes that have not just a single victim, but theyre intended to stigmatize and dehumanize a whole group of people.",2000-10-11,Democrat

Bush,"No, I dont, really.",2000-10-11,Republican
Moderator,On hate crimes laws?,2000-10-11,Moderator
Bush,"No. Weve got one in Texas. And guess what? The three men who murdered James Byrd, guess whats going to happen to them? Theyre going to be put to death. A jury found them guilty. Its going to be hard to punish them any worse after they get put to death. And its the right cause. Its the right decision. Secondly, there is other forms of racial profiling that goes on in America. Arab-Americans are racially profiled in what is called secret evidence. People are stopped, and we have to do something about that. My friend, Senator Spencer Abraham of Michigan, is pushing a law to make sure that Arab-Americans are treated with respect. So racial profiling isnt just an issue at local police forces. Its an issue throughout our society. And as we become a diverse society, were going to have to deal with it more and more. I believe, though  I believe, as sure as Im sitting here, that most Americans really care. Theyre tolerant people. Theyre good, tolerant people. Its the very few that create most of the crises, and we just have to find them and deal with them.",2000-10-11,Republican
Moderator,"What  if you become president, Governor, are there other areas, racial problem areas, that you would deal with as president involving discrimination? Like you said, Arab-Americans, but also Hispanics, Asians, as well as Blacks in this country.",2000-10-11,Moderator
Bush,"Let me tell you where the biggest discrimination comes. In public education when we just move children through the schools. My friend, Phyllis Hunter, is here. She had one of the greatest lines of all lines. She said, reading is the new civil right. Shes right. And to make sure our society is as hopeful as it possibly can be, every single child in America must be educated. I mean every child. It starts with making sure every child learns to read. K-2 diagnostic testing so we know whether or not theres a deficiency. Curriculum that works and phonics needs to be an integral part of our reading curriculum. Intensive reading laboratories, teacher retraining. I mean, there needs to be a wholesale effort against racial profiling, which is illiterate children. We can do better in our public schools. We can close an achievement gap, and it starts with making sure we have strong accountability, Jim. One of the cornerstones of reform, and good reform, is to measure. Because when you measure you can ask the question, do they know? Is anybody being profiled? Is anybody being discriminated against? It becomes a tool, a corrective tool. And I believe the federal government must say that if you receive any money, any money from the federal government for disadvantaged children, for example, you must show us whether or not the children are learning. And if they are, fine. And if theyre not, there has to be a consequence. And so to make sure we end up getting rid of basic structural prejudice is education. There is nothing more prejudiced than not educating a child.",2000-10-11,Republican

I may have been misled by all the news reports about this matter, because the law that was proposed in Texas that had the support of the Byrd family and a whole lot of people in Texas did, in fact, die in committee. There may be some other statute that was already on the books, but certainly the advocates of the hate crimes law felt that a tough new law was needed. And its important, Jim, not only  not just because of Texas, but because this mirrors the national controversy. There is pending now in the Congress a national hate crimes law because of James Byrd, because of Matthew Shepard, who was crucified on a split rail fence by bigots, and because of others. And that law has died in committee also because of the same kind of opposition.",2000-10-11,Democrat

That bill did  there was another bill that did die in committee. But I want to repeat, if you have a state that fully supports the law like we do in Texas, were going to go after all crime.

Im going to be respectful for people who may disagree with me. Ive had a record of doing so in the State of Texas.

Moderator,"New subject, new question, Vice President Gore. How do you see the connection between controlling gun sales in this country and the incidence of death by accidental or intentional use of guns?",2000-10-11,Moderator
Gore,"Jim, I hope that we can come back to the subject of education because the governor made an extensive statement on it and I have a very different view than the one he expressed. But that having been said, I believe that  well, first of all, let me say that the governor and I agree on some things where this subject is concerned. I will not do anything to affect the rights of hunters or sportsmen. I think that homeowners have to be respected and their right to have a gun if they wish to. The problem I see is that there are too many guns getting into the hands of children, and criminals, and people who, for whatever reason, some kind of history of stalking or domestic abuse really should not be able to get guns. I think these assault weapons are a problem. So I favor closing the gun show loophole. In fact, I cast the tie-breaking vote to close it, but then the majority in the House of Representatives went the other way. Thats still pending. If we could get agreement on that, maybe they could pass that in the final days of this Congress. I think we ought to restore the three-day waiting period under the Brady Law. I think we should toughen the enforcement of gun laws so that the ones that are already on the books can be enforced much more effectively. Some of the restrictions that have been placed by the Congress in the last couple of years. I think  in the last few years I think have been unfortunate. I think that we ought to make all schools gun free. Have a gun-free zone around every school in this country. I think that measures like these are important. Child safety trigger locks on a mandatory basis, and others.",2000-10-11,Democrat
Moderator,Governor?,2000-10-11,Moderator
Bush,"Well, it starts with enforcing law. When you say loud and clear to somebody if youre going to carry a gun illegally, were going to arrest you. If youre going to sell a gun illegally, you need to be arrested. If you commit a crime with a gun, there needs to be absolute certainty in the law. And that means that the local law enforcement officials need help at the federal level. Programs like Project Exile where the federal government intensifies arresting people who illegally use guns. And we havent done a very good job of that at the federal level recently. And Im going to make it a priority. Secondly, I dont think we ought to be selling guns to people who shouldnt have them. Thats why I support instant background checks at gun shows. One of the reasons we have an instant background check is so that we instantly know whether or not somebody should have a gun or not. In Texas I tried to do something innovative. Theres a lot of talk about trigger locks being on guns sold in the future. I support that. But I said if you want a trigger lock to make your gun safe, come and get one for free. So were distributing in our State of Texas for free. I think we ought to raise the age at which a juvenile can carry a handgun from 18 to 21. I disagree with the vice president on this issue. He is for registration of guns. I think the only people that are going to show up to register or get a license  I guess licensing like a drivers license for a gun, the only people that are going to show up are law-abiding citizens. The criminal is not going to show up and say hey, give me my I.D. card. Its the law-abiding citizens who will do that. An I dont think that is going to be an effective tool to make the  keep our society safe.",2000-10-11,Republican
Moderator,"All right. So on guns, somebody wants to cast a vote based on your differences, where are the differences?",2000-10-11,Moderator

Gore,Correct.,2000-10-11,Democrat
Moderator,All right. Who would issue the,2000-10-11,Moderator
Gore,"The state. The state. I think states should do that for new handguns, because too many criminals are getting guns. There was a recent investigation of the number in Texas who got  who were given concealed weapons permits in spite of the fact that they had records. And the Los Angeles Times spent a lot of ink going into that. But I am not for doing anything that would affect hunters or sportsmen, rifles, shotguns, existing handguns. I do think that sensible gun safety measures are warranted now. Look, this is the year  this is in the aftermath of Columbine, and Paducah, and all the places in our country where the nation has been shocked by these weapons in the hands of the wrong people. The woman who bought the guns for the two boys who did that killing at Columbine said that if she had had to give her name and fill out a form there, she would not have bought those guns. That conceivably could have prevented that tragedy.",2000-10-11,Democrat
Moderator,"Back to the question about the differences on gun control. What are they, Governor, from your point of view, between you and the Vice President?",2000-10-11,Moderator
Bush,"Well, Im not for photo licensing. Let me say something about Columbine. Listen, weve got gun laws. He says we ought to have gun-free schools. Everybody believes that. Im sure every state in the union has got them. You cant carry a gun into a school. And there ought to be a consequence when you do carry a gun into a school. But Columbine spoke to a larger issue. Its really a matter of culture. Its a culture that somewhere along the line weve begun to disrespect life. Where a child can walk in and have their heart turned dark as a result of being on the Internet and walk in and decide to take somebody elses life? So gun laws are important, no question about it, but so is loving children, and character education classes, and faith-based programs being a part of after-school programs. Some desperate child needs to have somebody put their arm around them and say, we love you. So theres a  this is a society that  of ours thats got to do a better job of teaching children right from wrong. And we can enforce law. But there seems to be a lot of preoccupation on  not certainly only in this debate, but just in general on law. But theres a larger law. Love your neighbor like you would like to be loved yourself. And thats where our society must head if were going to be a peaceful and prosperous society.",2000-10-11,Republican
Gore,"I also believe in the Golden Rule. And I agree with a lot of the other things that the governor has said. We do have a serious problem in our culture. Tipper and I have worked on the problem of violence in entertainment aimed at children. Shes worked on it longer than I have. But I feel very strongly about that. And if Im elected president, I will do something about that. But I think that we  I think we have to start with better parenting. But I dont think that we can ignore the role played by guns. I mean, the fact is that there  even though no state wants them, there are guns in some schools. And the reason its so difficult for schools to control that is because in recent years there has been a flood of cheap handguns that are so widely available that kids are finding ways to get ahold of them. And I think that if you look at the situation as it exists here in the United States compared to any other country in the world, it seems to me pretty obvious that while we respect the rights of hunters and sportsmen, we do need some common sense gun safety steps to stem this flood of guns that are getting into the wrong hands.",2000-10-11,Democrat
Bush,"Yeah, no question about that, but there also needs to be strong enforcement of the law. Some kid who feels like  doesnt matter where the gun comes from, it could be a cheap gun, expensive gun. What matters is something in this persons head says there is not going to be a consequence. So in my state we toughen up the juvenile justice laws. We added beds. Were tough. We believe in tough love. We say, if you get caught carrying a gun, youre automatically detained. And thats what needs to happen. Weve got laws. If laws need to be strengthened, like instant background checks, thats important.",2000-10-11,Republican

Bush,"Well, Ive got a plan to do something about that. Its to make health care affordable and available this way. First, theres some who should be buying health care who choose not to. Theres some",2000-10-11,Republican
Moderator,Some of the 40 million.,2000-10-11,Moderator
Bush,"Some of the healthy folks, healthy young kids say Ill never get sick, therefore I dont need health care right now. For those what I think we need to do is to develop an investment-type vehicle that would be an incentive for them to invest, like medical savings accounts with rollover capacity. In other words, you say to a youngster, it will be in your financial interest to start saving for future illness, but for the working folks that do want to have health care that cant afford it, a couple of things we need to do. One, we need more community health centers. Ive developed  put out money in my budget to expand community health centers all around the country. These are places where people can get primary care. Secondly  and theyre good. Theyre very important parts of the safety net of health care. Secondly, that you get a $2,000 rebate from the government if youre a family of $30,000 or less  it scales down as you get higher  that you can use to purchase health care in the private markets. It will be a huge down payment for a pretty darn good system. If you allow  also allow  convince states to  allow states to allow the mother to match some of the childrens health insurance money with it, the pool purchasing power. And to make health care more affordable, allow business associations like the National Federal of Independent Business or the Chamber of Commerce or the National Restaurant Association to write association plans across jurisdictional lines so that small businesses have got the capacity to have national pooling to drive the cost of insurance down. I think thats the very best way to go. It empowers people, it trusts people, it makes  and its a practical way to encourage people to purchase health care insurance.",2000-10-11,Republican
Moderator,Vice President Gore?,2000-10-11,Moderator
Gore,"Its one of my top priorities, Jim, to give every single child in the United States affordable health care within the next four years. I would like to see eventually in this country some form of universal health care, but Im not for a government-run system. In fact, Im for shrinking the size of government. I want a smaller and smarter government. I have been in charge of this reinventing government streamlining project thats reduced the size of government by more than 300,000 people in the last several years. And the budget plan that Ive put out, according to the Los Angeles Times again, the way these things are typically measured as a percentage of the GDP, will bring government spending down to the lowest level in 50 years. So I want to proceed carefully to cover more people. But I think we should start by greatly expanding the so-called child health insurance or CHIP program to give health insurance to every single child in this country. I think its intolerable that we have so many millions of children without any health insurance. So its one of my top priorities. Now, I know that we have some disagreements on this. And Im sorry to tell you that, you know, there is a record here. And Texas ranks 49th out of the 50 states in health care  in children with health care. 49th for women with health care, and 50th for families with health care. So it is a priority for me. I guarantee you. Im not aware of any program  well, Ill just leave it at that. I think it ought to be a top priority.",2000-10-11,Democrat
Moderator,"Governor, did the  are the vice presidents figures correct about Texas?",2000-10-11,Moderator
Bush,"First of all, let me say hes not for a government-run health care system? I thought thats exactly what he and Mrs. Clinton and them fought for in 1993 was a government-run health care system. It was fortunately stopped in its tracks. Secondly, we spend $4.7 billion a year on the uninsured in the State of Texas. Our rate of uninsured, the percentage of uninsured in Texas has gone down, while the percentage of uninsured in America has gone up. Our CHIPS program got a late start because our government meets only four months out of every two years, Mr. Vice President. It may come as a shock for somebody who has been in Washington for so long. But actually limited government can work in the second largest state in the union. And therefore Congress passes the bill after our session in 1997 ended, we passed an enabling legislation in 1999. Weve signed up over 110,000 children to the CHIPS program. For comparable states our size, were signing them up as fast as any other state. You can quote all the numbers you want, but Im telling you we care about our people in Texas. We spent a lot of money to make sure people get health care in the State of Texas, and were doing a better job than they are at the national level for reducing uninsured.",2000-10-11,Republican
Moderator,Is he right?,2000-10-11,Moderator
Gore,"Well, I dont know about all these percentages that he throws out, but I do know that  I speculate that the reason why he didnt answer your question directly as to whether my numbers were right, the facts were right about Texas ranking dead last in families with health insurance and 49th out of 50 for both children and women, is because those facts are correct. And as for why it happened, Im no expert on the Texas procedures, but what my friends there tell me is that the governor opposed a measure put forward by Democrats in the legislature to expand the number of children that would be covered. And instead directed the money toward a tax cut, a significant part of which went to wealthy interests. He declared the need for a new tax cut for the oil companies in Texas an emergency need, and so the money was taken away from the CHIP program. Theres  you dont have to take my word for this. There is now a federal judges opinion about the current management of this program ordering the State of Texas to do  you should read that judges language about this. I believe there are 1.4 million children in Texas who do not have health insurance. 600,000 of whom, and maybe some of those have since gotten it, but as of a year ago 600,000 of them were actually eligible for it but they couldnt sign up for it because of the barriers that they had set up.",2000-10-11,Democrat
Moderator,Lets let the governor respond to that. Are those numbers correct? Are his charges correct?,2000-10-11,Moderator
Bush,"If hes trying to allege that Im a hard-hearted person and I dont care about children, hes absolutely wrong. Weve spent $4.7 billion a year in the State of Texas for uninsured people. And they get health care. Now, its not the most efficient way to get people health care. But I want to remind you, the number of uninsured in America during their watch has increased. He can make any excuse he wants, but the facts are that were reducing the number of uninsured percentage of our population. And as the percentage of the population is increasing nationally, somehow the allegation that we dont care and were going to give money for this interest or that interest and not for children in the State of Texas is totally absurd. Let me just tell you who the jury is. The people of Texas. Theres only been one governor ever elected to back-to-back four-year terms, and that was me. And I was able to do so with a lot of Democrat votes, nearly 50% of the Hispanic vote, about 27% of the African-American vote, because people know Im a conservative person and a compassionate person. So he can throw all the kinds of numbers around. Im just telling you our state comes together to do what is right. We come together both Republicans and Democrats.",2000-10-11,Republican
Moderator,"Let me put that directly to you, Vice President Gore. The reason you brought this up, is it  are you suggesting that those numbers and that record will reflect the way Governor Bush will operate in this area of health insurance as president?",2000-10-11,Moderator
Gore,"Yes, yes. But its not a statement about his heart. I dont claim to know his heart. I think hes a good person. I make no allegations about that. I believe him when he says that he has a good heart. I know enough about your story to admire a lot of the things that you have done as a person. But I think its about his priorities. And let me tell you exactly why I think that the choice he made to give a tax cut for the oil companies and others before addressing this  I mean, if you were the governor of a state that was dead last in health care for families, and all of a sudden you found yourself with the biggest surplus your state had ever had in its history, wouldnt you want to maybe use some of it to climb from 50th to, say, 45 or 40 or something or maybe better? I would. Now, but here is why its directly relevant, Jim. Because by his own budget numbers, his proposals for spending on tax cuts for the wealthiest of the wealthy are more than the new spending proposals that he has made for health care and education and national defense all combined. According to his own numbers. So its not a question of his heart, as far as I know. Its a question of priorities and values. See, you know",2000-10-11,Democrat

Bush,"First of all, thats simply not true what he just said, of course. And secondly, I repeat to you",2000-10-11,Republican
Moderator,"What is not true, Governor?",2000-10-11,Moderator
Bush,"That we spent  the top 1% receive 223 as opposed to 445 billion in new spending. The top  lets talk about my tax plan. The top 1% will pay one-third of all the federal income taxes. And in return, get one-fifth of the benefits, because most of the tax reductions go to the people at the bottom end of the economic ladder. That stands in stark contrast, by the way, to a man who is going to leave 50 million  50 million Americans out of tax relief. We just have a different point of view. Its a totally different point of view. He believes only the right people ought to get tax relief. I believe everybody who pays taxes ought to get tax relief. Let me go back to Texas, for example, for a minute. We pay 4.7 billion. I cant emphasize to you how much. I signed a bill that puts CHIPS in place. The bill finally came out at the end of the 1999 session. Were working hard to sign up children. Were doing it faster than any other state our size, comparable state. Were making really good progress. And our state cares a lot about our children. My priority is going to be the health of our citizens. These folks have had eight years to get something done in Washington, D.C. on the uninsured. They have not done it. Theyve had eight years to get something done on Medicare. And they have not got it done. And my case to the American people is, if youre happy with inactivity, stay with the horse. The horse is up here now. But if you want change, you need to get somebody that knows how to bring Republicans and Democrats together to get positive things done for America.",2000-10-11,Republican
Moderator,"New question, new subject. Vice President Gore, on the environment. In your 1992 book you said, quote, We must make the rescue of our environment the central organizing principle for civilization and there must be a wrenching transformation to save the planet. Do you still feel that way?",2000-10-11,Moderator
Gore,"I do. I think that in this 21st century we will soon see the consequences of whats called global warming. There was a study just a few weeks ago suggesting that in summertime the north polar ice cap will be completely gone in 50 years. Already many people see the strange weather conditions that the old timers say theyve never seen before in their lifetimes. And whats happening is the level of pollution is increasing significantly. Now, here is the good news, Jim. If we take the leadership role and build the new technologies, like the new kinds of cars and trucks that Detroit is itching to build, then we can create millions of good new jobs by being first into the market with these new kinds of cars and trucks and other kinds of technologies. You know the Japanese are breathing down our necks on this. Theyre moving very rapidly because they know that it is a fast-growing world market. Some of these other countries, particularly in the developing world, their pollution is much worse than anywhere else and their people want higher standards of living. And so theyre looking for ways to satisfy their desire for a better life and still reduce pollution at the same time. I think that holding onto the old ways and the old argument that the environment and the economy are in conflict is really outdated. We have to be bold. We have to provide leadership. Now its true that we disagree on this. The governor said that he doesnt think this problem is necessarily caused by people. Hes for letting the oil companies into the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Houston has just become the smoggiest city in the country. And Texas is number one in industrial pollution. We have a very different outlook.

And people are willing to invest capital in the brown fields dont want to do so for fear of lawsuit. I think we ought to have federal liability protection, depending upon whether or not standards have been met. The book you mentioned that Vice President Gore wrote, he also called for taxing  big energy taxes in order to clean up the environment. And now that the energy prices are high, I guess hes not advocating those big energy taxes right now. I believe we ought to fully fund the Land and Water Conservation Fund to  with half the money going to states so states can make the right decisions for environmental quality. I think we need to have clean coal technologies. I propose $2 billion worth. By the way, I just found out the other day an interesting fact, that there is a national petroleum reserve right next to  in Prudhoe Bay that your administration opened up for exploration in that pristine area. And it was a smart move because theres gas reserves up there. We need gas pipelines to bring the gas down. Gas is a clean fuel that we can burn to  we need to make sure that if we decontrol our plants that theres mandatory  that the plants must conform to clean air standards, the grandfathered plants, thats what we did in Texas. No excuses. You must conform. In other words, there are practical things we can do. But it starts with working in a collaborative effort with states and local folks.

Bush,"I think its an issue that we need to take very seriously. But I dont think we know the solution to global warming yet. And I dont think weve got all the facts before we make decisions. I tell you one thing Im not going to do is Im not going to let the United States carry the burden for cleaning up the worlds air. Like Kyoto Treaty would have done. China and India were exempted from that treaty. I think we need to be more even-handed, as evidently 99 senators  I think it was 99 senators supported that position.",2000-10-11,Republican

Gore,"Well, that vote wasnt exactly  a lot of the supporters of the Kyoto Treaty actually ended up voting for that because the way it was worded. But theres no doubt theres a lot of opposition to it in the Senate. Im not for command and control techniques either. Im for working with the groups, not just with industry but also with the citizen groups and local communities to control sprawl in ways that the local communities themselves come up with. But I disagree that we dont know the cause of global warming. I think that we do. Its pollution, carbon dioxide, and other chemicals that are even more potent, but in smaller quantities, that cause this. Look, the worlds temperature is going up, weather patterns are changing, storms are getting more violent and unpredictable. What are we going to tell our children? Im a grandfather now. I want to be able to tell my grandson when Im in my later years that I didnt turn away from the evidence that showed that we were doing some serious harm. In my faith tradition, it is  its written in the book of Matthew, Where your heart is, there is your treasure also. And I believe that  that we ought to recognize the value to our children and grandchildren of taking steps that preserve the environment in a way thats good for them.",2000-10-11,Democrat

And before we react, I think its best to have the full accounting, full understanding of whats taking place. And I think to answer your question, I think both of us care a lot about the environment. We may have different approaches. We may have different approaches in terms of how we deal with local folks. I just cited an example of the administration just unilaterally acting without any input. And I remember you gave a very good answer to New Hampshire about the White Mountains, about how it was important to keep that collaborative effort in place. I feel very strongly the same place.

And yes, I think its something that people need to consider. This isnt something new.

And I am going to continue to defend my record and defend my propositions against what I think are exaggerations. Exaggerations like, for example, only 5% of seniors receive benefits under my Medicare reform package. Thats what he said the other day, and thats simply not the case.

Gore,"I got some of the details wrong last week in some of the examples that I used, Jim, and Im sorry about that. And Im going to try to do better. One of the reasons I regret it is that getting a detail wrong interfered several times with the point that I was trying to make. However many days that young girl in Florida stood in her classroom, however long, even if it was only one day, doesnt change the fact that there are a lot of overcrowded classrooms in America and we need to do something about that. There are seniors who pay more for their prescriptions than a lot of other people, more than their pets, sometimes. More sometimes than people in foreign countries. And we need to do something about that. Not with the measure that leaves the majority of them without any real basic help until the next presidents term of four years is over. But right away. And that means doing it under the Medicare program. I cant promise that I will never get another detail wrong. I can promise you that I will try not to, and hard.

Gore,"Jim, one of the issues that I would like to close with in my statement is education, because its an example of the overall approach that I think is important. This race is about values, its about change, its about giving choices to the American people. And education is my number one priority, because I think that its the most important big major change that we can bring in our country. I agree with Governor Bush that we should have new accountability, testing of students. I think that we should require states to test all students, test schools and school districts, and I think that we should go further and require teacher testing for new teachers also. The difference is that while my plan starts with new accountability and maintains local control, it doesnt stop there. Because I want to give new choices to parents. To send their kids to college with a $10,000 tax deduction for college tuition per child per year. I want to reduce the size of the classrooms in this country. For one basic reason, so that students can get more one-on-one time with teachers. And the way to do that is first to recruit more teachers. Ive a plan in my budget to recruit 100,000 new, highly qualified teachers and to help local school districts build new schools. I think that we have to put more emphasis on early learning and pre-school. Now, here is how that connects with all the rest of what weve been talking about. If you have  if you squander the surplus on a huge tax cut that goes mostly to those at the top, then you cant make education the top priority. If the tax cut is your number one, two, three and four priority, you cant do education. You cant do both. You have to choose. I choose education and health care, the environment and retirement security, and I ask for your support.",2000-10-11,Democrat

Bush,"Jim, thank you very much. Mr. Vice President, thank you very much, and I would like to thank the folks here at Wake Forest, and I want to thank you all for listening. Im running to get some things done for America. Theres too many issues left unresolved. Theres been too much finger pointing and too much name calling in Washington, D.C. I would like to unite this country to get an agenda done that will speak to the hopes and aspirations of the future. I want to have an education system that sets high standards, local control of schools and strong accountability. No child should be left behind in America. I want to make sure we rebuild our military to keep the peace. I worry about morale in todays military. The warning signs are clear. It is time to have a new commander in chief who will rebuild the military, pay our men and women more, make sure theyre housed better and have a focused mission for our military. Once and for all, I want to do something about Medicare. This issue has been too long on the table because its been a political issue. Its time to bring folks together to say that all seniors will get prescription drug coverage. I want to do something about Social Security. Its an important priority, because now is the time to act and were going to say to our seniors, our promises weve made to you will be promises kept. But younger workers, in order to make sure the system exists tomorrow, younger workers ought to be able to take some of your own money and invest it in safe securities to get a better rate of return on that money. And finally, I do believe in tax relief. I believe we can set our priorities. I dont believe, like the vice president does, in huge government. I believe in limited government. By having a limited government and a focused government, we can send some of the money back to the people who pay the bills. I want to have tax relief for all people who pay the bills in America, because I think you can spend your money more wisely than the federal government can. Thank you for listening.

Edwin Newman,"Good evening. Im Edwin Newman, moderator of this first debate of the 1976 campaign between Gerald R. Ford of Michigan, Republican candidate for president, and Jimmy Carter of Georgia, Democratic candidate for president. We thank you, President Ford and we thank you, Governor Carter, for being with us tonight. There are to be three debates between the presidential candidates and one between the vice-presidential candidates. All are being arranged by the League of Women Voters Education Fund. Tonights debate, the first between presidential candidates in sixteen years and the first ever in which an incumbent president has participated, is taking place before an audience in the Walnut Street Theater in Philadelphia, just three blocks from Independence Hall. The television audience may reach a hundred million in the United States and many millions overseas. Tonights debate focuses on domestic issues and economic policy. Questions will be put by Frank Reynolds of ABC News, James Gannon of the Wall Street Journal, and Elizabeth Drew of the New Yorker magazine. Under the agreed rules the first question will go to Governor Carter. That was decided by the toss of a coin. He will have up to three minutes to answer. One follow-up question will be permitted with up to two minutes to reply. President Ford will then have two minutes to respond. The next question will go to President Ford with the same time arrangements, and questions will continue to be alternated between the candidates. Each man will make a three-minute statement at the end, Governor Carter to go first. President Ford and Governor Carter do not have any notes or prepared remarks with them this evening. Mr. Reynolds, your question for Governor Carter.",1976-09-23,Moderator
Mr. Reynolds,"Mr. President, Governor Carter. Governor, in an interview with the Associated Press last week, you said you believed these debates would alleviate a lot of concern that some voters have about you. Well, one of those concerns, not an uncommon one about uh  candidates in any year, is that many voters say they dont really know where you stand. Now, you have made jobs your number one priority and you have said you are committed to a drastic reduction in unemployment. Can you say now, Governor, in specific terms, what your first step would be next January, if you are elected, to achieve that.",1976-09-23,Moderator
Mr. Carter,"Yes. First of all is to recognize a tremendous economic strength in this country and to set the putting to  back to work of our people as a top priority. This is uh  an effort that ought to be done primarily by strong leadership in the White House, the inspiration of our people, the tapping of uh  business, agriculture, industry, labor and government at all levels to work on this uh project. Well never have uh  an end to the inflationary spiral, and well never have a balanced budget until we get our people back to work. There are several things that can be done specifically that are not now being done. First of all, to channel research and development funds into areas that will provide uh large numbers of jobs. Secondly, we need to have a commitment in the uh private sector uh  to cooperate with government in matters like housing. Here a very small investment of taxpayers money  in the housing field can bring large numbers of extra jobs, and the guarantee of mortgage loans, and the uh  putting forward of uh  two-0-two programs for housing for older people and so forth to cut down the roughly 20 percent unemployment that now exists in the  in the construction industry. Another thing is to deal with our  uh needs in the central cities, where the unemployment rate is extremely high: sometimes among minority groups, or those who dont speak English, or whore black, or young people, or  40 percent of the employment. Here a CCC type program would be appropriate to channel money into the ah  cha- in  in into the sharing with the private sector and also local and state governments to employ young people who are now out of work. Another very important  uh aspect of our  uh economy would be to increase production in every way possible, uh to hold down  uh taxes on individuals, and to uh shift the tax burdens onto those who have avoided paying taxes in the past. These uh  kinds of specific things, uh none of which are being done now, would be a great help in  in reducing uh unemployment. There is uh  uh an additional factor that needs to be done and covered very  very succinctly, and that is, to make sure that we have a good relationship between management  business on the one hand, and labor, on the other. In a > Transfer interrupted! ery high, we might channel specific uh targeted job  job  uh opportunities by paying part of the salary of unemployed people  uh and also sharing with uh  local governments the uh  payment of salaries which would uh  let us cut down the unemployment rate much lower, before we hit the inflationary level. But I believe that by the end of the first four years of uh  of the next term we could have the unemployment down to 3 percent adult unemployment, which is about uh  4 to 4 and a half percent overall uh controlled inflation rate and have a uh balance of growth of about  uh 4 to 6 percent, around 5 percent which would give us a balanced budget.",1976-09-23,Democrat
Mr. Reynolds,"Governor, uh  in the event you are successful and you do achieve a drastic drop",1976-09-23,Moderator
Mr. Carter,"Yes, in unemployment that is likely to create additional pressure on prices, how willing are you to consider an incomes policy, in other words, wage and price controls?",1976-09-23,Democrat
Mr. Carter,"Well  we now have such uh  a low utilization of uh  our productive capacity  uh about 73 percent; I think its about the lowest since the Great Depression years  and such a high unemployment rate now  uh 7.9 percent  that  uh we have a long way to go in getting people to work before we have the inflationary pressures. And I think this would uh  this would be uh easy to accomplish, to get jobs down, without having strong in- inflationary pressures that  that would be necessary. I would not favor the uh  payment of uh  of a given fixed income to people unless they are not able to work. But with tax incentives for the low-income groups we could build up their uh  income levels uh  above the poverty level and not uh make welfare more uh  profitable than  than work.",1976-09-23,Democrat
Mr. Newman,"Mr. President, your response.",1976-09-23,Moderator
Mr. Ford,"I dont believe that uh that Mr. Carters been any more specific in this case than he has been on many other instances. I notice particularly that he didnt endorse the Humphrey-Hawkins bill which he has on occasions and which is included as a part of the Democratic platform. That legislation uh allegedly would help our unemployment, but uh  we all know that it wouldve controlled our economy, it wouldve added uh  ten to thirty billion dollars each year in additional expenditures by the Federal Government. It wouldve called for export controls on agricultural products In my judgment the best way to get jobs is to uh  expand the private sector, where five out of six jobs today exist in our economy. We can do that by reducing Federal taxes as I proposed uh  about a year ago when I called for a tax reduction of $28 billion  three-quarters of it to go to private uh taxpayers and uh one-quarter to the business sector. We could add to jobs in the major metropolitan areas by a proposal that I recommended that would give tax incentives to business to move into the inner city and to expand or to build new plants so that they would take a plant, or expand a plant where people are, and people are currently unemployed. We could uh  also uh  help our youths with some of the proposals that uh  would give to young people an opportunity to work and learn at the same time just like we give money to young people who are going to college. Those are the kind of specifics that I think we have to discuss on these uh  debates, and these are the kind of programs that Ill talk about on my time.",1976-09-23,Republican
Mr. Newman,"Mr. Gannon, your question to President Ford.",1976-09-23,Moderator
Mr. Gannon,"Mr. President, I would like to continue for a moment on this uh question of taxes which you have just raised. You have said that you favor more tax cuts for middle-income Americans  even those earning up to $30 thousand a year. That presumably would cost the Treasury quite a bit of money in lost revenue. In view of the very large budget deficits that you have accumulated and that are still in prospect, how is it possible to promise further tax cuts and to reach your goal of balancing the budget?",1976-09-23,Moderator
Mr. Ford,"At the time, Mr. Gannon, that I made the recommendation for a $28 billion tax cut  three-quarters of it to go to individual taxpayers and 25 percent to American business. I said at the time that we had to hold the lid an federal spending, that for every dollar of a tax reduction we had to have an equal reduction in federal expenditures  a one-for-one proposition. And I recommended that to the Congress with a budget ceiling of three hundred and ninety-five billion dollars, and that would have permitted us to have a $25 billion tax reduction. In my tax reduction program for middle-income taxpayers, I recommended that the Congress increase personal exemptions from seven hundred and fifty dollars per person to one thousand dollars per person. That would mean, of course, that for a family of four that that family would have a thousand dollars more personal exemption  money that they could spend for their own purposes, money that the government wouldnt have to spend. But if we keep the lid on federal spending, which I think we can  with the help of the Congress, we can justify fully a $28 billion tax reduction. In the budget that I submitted to the Congress in January this year, I re- recommended a 50 percent cutback in the rate of growth of federal spending. For the last ten years the budget of the United States has grown from uh  about 11 percent per year. We cant afford that kind of growth in federal spending. And in the budget that I recommended we cut it in half  a growth rate of 5 to 5 and one-half percent. With that kind of limitation, on federal spending, we can fully justify the tax reductions that I have proposed. And it seems to me with the stimulant of more money in the hands of the taxpayers, and with more money in the hands of business to expand, to modernize, to provide more jobs, our economy stimulated so that well get more revenue and well have a more prosperous economy.",1976-09-23,Republican
Mr. Gannon,"Mr. President, to follow up a moment, uh  the Congress has passed a tax bill which is before you now, which did not meet exactly the uh  sort of outline that you requested. What is your intention on that bill, uh  since it doesnt meet your  your requirements? Do you plan to sign that bill?",1976-09-23,Moderator
Mr. Ford,"That tax bill does not entirely meet the criteria that I established. I think the Congress should have uh  added another $10 billion reduction in personal income taxes, including the increase of personal exemptions from seven hundred and fifty to a thousand dollars. And Congress could have done that if the budget committees of the Congress, and the Congress as a whole, had not increased the spending that I recommended in the budget. Im sure that you know that in the resolutions passed by the Congress, that have added about $17 billion in more spending, by the Congress over the budget that I recommended. So I would prefer in that tax bill to have an additional tax cut and a further limitation on federal spending. Now this tax bill  that hasnt reached the White House yet, but is expected in a day or two  its about fifteen hundred pages. It has some good provisions in it. It has  uh left out some that I have recommended, unfortunately. On the other hand, uh when you have a bill of that magnitude, with  tho- those many provisions, a president has to sit and decide if theres more good than bad. And from the a- analysis that Ive made so far, it seems to me that that tax bill does uh  justify my signature and my approval.",1976-09-23,Republican
Mr. Newman,"Governor Carter, your response.",1976-09-23,Moderator
Mr. Carter,"Well, Mr. Ford is  is uh changing uh considerably his previous philosophy. The present tax structure is a disgrace to this country; its just a welfare program for the rich. As a matter of fact, uh  25 percent of the total tax deductions, go for only 1 percent of the richest people in this country, and over 50 percent of the tax uh credits go for the 14 percent of the richest people in this country. When Mr. Ford first became president in  in August of 1974, the first thing he did in  in October was to ask for a $4.7 billion increase in taxes on our people in the midst of the heaviest recession, since uh  since the great depression of nineteen uh  of the 1940s. In uh  January of 1975 he asked for a tax change: a $5.6 billion increase on low-and-middle-income private individuals, a six and a half billion dollar decrease on the corporations and the special interests. In uh  December of uh  1975 he vetoed the roughly 18 to 20 billion dollar uh tax-reduction bill that had been passed by the Congress, and then he came back later on in January of this year and he did advocate a $10 billion tax reduction, but it would be offset by a $6 billion increase this coming January in deductions for Social Security payments and for unemployment compensation. The whole philosophy of the Republican party, including uh  my opponent, has been to pile on taxes on low-income people to take em off on the corporations. As a matter fact, in  sin- since the late sixties when Mr. Nixon took office, weve had a reduction in uh  in the percentage of taxes paid by corporations from 30 percent down to about 20 percent. Weve had an increase in taxes paid by individuals, payroll taxes, from14 Percent up to 20 percent. And this is what the Republicans have done to us. And this is why a tax reform is so important.",1976-09-23,Democrat
Mr. Newman,"Mrs. Drew, your question to Governor Carter.",1976-09-23,Moderator
Ms. Drew,"Uh Governor Carter, you proposed a number of new or enlarged programs, including jobs, health, welfare reform, child care, aid to education, aid to cities, changes in social security and housing subsidies. Youve also said that you wanna balance the budget by the end of your first term. Now you havent put a price tag on those programs, but even if we price them conservatively and we count for full employment by the end of your first term, and we count for the economic growth that would occur during that period, there still isnt enough money to pay for those programs and balance the budget by any  any estimates that Ive been able to see. So, in that case what would give?",1976-09-23,Moderator
Mr. Carter,"Well, as a matter of fact there is. If we assume the ah  uh  a rate of growth of our economy, equivalent to what it was during President Johnson, President Kennedy, even before the  the  the  uh wa uh  Vietnese- namese War, and if we assume that at the end of the four-year period we can cut our unemployment rate down to 4 to 4 and a half percent  under those circumstances, even assuming no elimination of unnecessary programs and assuming an increase in the ad- in the allotment of money to finance programs, increasing as the inflation rate does  my economic projections, I think confirmed by the House uh  and the Senate committees, have been with the $60 billion extra amount of money that can be spent in fiscal year 81 which will be the last year of this next term. Within that sixty-billion dollars increase there would be fit the programs that I promised the American people. I might say too, that  that if we see that these goals cannot be reached  and I believe theyre reasonable goals  then I would cut back on the rate of implement- implementation of new programs in order to accommodate a balanced budget by fiscal year 81 which is the last year of the next term. I believe that we ought to have a balanced budget during normal economic circumstances. And uh  these projections have been very carefully made. I stand behind them. And if they should be in error slightly on the down side, then Ill phase in the programs that weve uh  advocated, more slowly.",1976-09-23,Democrat
Ms. Drew,"Governor, uh  according to the budget committees of the Congress tha- tha- tha- that you referred to, if we get to full employment  what they project at a 4 percent unemployment  and, as you say, even allowing for the inflation in the programs, there would not be anything more than a surplus of $5 billion by the end of ninet- by 1981. And conservative estimates of your programs would be that theyd be about 85 to a hundred billion dollars. So how  how do you say that youre going to be able to do these things and balance the budget?",1976-09-23,Moderator
Mr. Carter,"Well, the uh  the assumption that  that you uh  have described as different is in the rate of growth of our economy.",1976-09-23,Democrat
Ms. Drew,"No, they took that into account in those figures.",1976-09-23,Moderator
Mr. Carter,"I believe that its accurate to say that  that the  that the committees to whom you refer with the  the employment that you uh  state, and with the 5 to 5 and a half percent growth rate in our economy, that the uh  projections would be a uh  a $60 billion increase in the amount of money that wed have to spend in l981 compared to now. And uh  with that uh  in that framework would befit the  any improvements in the programs. Now this does not include uh  any uh  uh extra control over uh unnecessary spending, the weeding out of obsolete or obsolescent programs. Uh  well have uh  a safety version built in with complete reorganization of the executive branch of government which I am pledged to do. The present bureaucratic structure of the  of the Federal Government is a mess. And if Im elected president thats gonna be a top priority of mine to completely revise the structure of the federal government, to make it economical, efficient, purposeful and manageable for a change. And also, Im going to institute zero-based budgeting which I used four years in Georgia, which uh  assesses every program every year, and eliminates those programs that are obsolete or obsolescent. But with these projections, we will have a balanced budget by fiscal year 1981, if Im elected president. Keep my promises to the American people. And its just predicated on very modest, but I think accurate, projections of employment increases and uh  a growth in our national economy equal to what was experienced under Kennedy, Johnson, before the Vietnam War.",1976-09-23,Democrat

Mr. Ford,"If it is uh true that there will be a $60 billion surplus by fiscal year 1981, rather than spend that money for all the new programs that Governor Carter recommends and endorses, and which are included in the Democratic platform, I think the American taxpayer ought to get an additional tax break  a tax reduction of that magnitude. I feel that the taxpayers are the ones that need the relief: I dont think we should add additional programs of the magnitude that Governor Carter talks about. It seems to me that our tax structure today has rates that are too high. But I am uh  very glad to point out that since 1969, during a Republican administrations, we have had ten million people taken off of the tax rolls at the lower end of the taxpayer area. And at the same time, assuming that I sign the tax bill that was mentioned by Mr. Gannon, we will in the last two tax bills have increased the minimum tax on all wealthy taxpayers. And I believe that by eliminating ten million taxpayers in the last uh eight years, and by putting a heavier tax burden on those in the higher tax brackets, plus the other actions thatve been taken uh  we can give taxpayers adequate tax relief. Now it seems to me that uh  as we look at the recommendations of the budget committees and our own projections, there isnt going to be any $60 billion dividend. Ive heard of those dividends in the past; it always happens. We expected one at the time of the Vietnam War, but it was used up before we ever ended the war and taxpayers never got the adequate relief they deserved.",1976-09-23,Republican

Mr. Reynolds,"Mr. President, when you came into office you spoke very eloquently of the need for a time for healing, and very early in your administration you went out to Chicago and you announced, you proposed a program of uh case-by-case pardons for draft resisters to restore them to full citizenship. Some fourteen thousand young men took advantage of your offer, but another ninety thousand did not. In granting the pardon to former President Nixon, sir, part of your rationale was to put Watergate behind us to  if I may quote you again  truly end our long national nightmare. Why does not the same rationale apply now, today, in our Bicentennial year, to the young men who resisted in Vietnam, and many of them still in exile abroad?",1976-09-23,Moderator
Mr. Ford,"The amnesty program that I recommended in Chicago in September of 1974 would give to all draft evaders and  uh military deserters the opportunity to earn their uh  good record back. About fourteen to fifteen thousand did take advantage of that program. We gave them ample time. I am against- an across-the-board pardon of draft evaders or military deserters. Now in the case of Mr. Nixon, the reason the  the pardon was given, was that, when I took office this country was in a very, very divided condition. There was hatred, there was divisiveness  uh people had lost faith in their government in many, many respects. Mr. Nixon resigned, and I became president. It seemed to me that if I was to uh adequately and effectively handle the problems of high inflation, a growing recession, the uh  involvement of the United States still in Vietnam that I had to give a hundred percent of my time to those two major problems. Mr. Nixon resigned. That is disgrace. The first President out of thirty-eight that ever resigned from public office under pressure. So when you look at the penalty that he paid, and when you analyze the requirements that I had  to spend all of my time working on the economy, which was in trouble, that I inherited; working on our problems in Southeast Asia  which were still plaguing us  it seemed to me that Mr. Nixon had been penalized enough by his resignation in disgrace and the need, and necessity for me to concentrate on the problems of the country fully justified the action that I took.",1976-09-23,Republican
Mr. Reynolds,"I take it then, sir, that you do not believe that uh  it is  that you are going to reconsider and uh  think about those ninety thousand who are still abroad. Uh  have they not been penalized enough  many of em been there for years?",1976-09-23,Moderator
Mr. Ford,"Well, Mr. Carter has uh indicated that uh  he would give a blanket pardon to all uh  draft evaders. I do not agree with that point of view. I gave, in September of 1974, an opportunity for all draft evaders, all deserters, to come in voluntarily, clear their records by earning an opportunity to restore their good citizenship. I think we gave them a good opportunity  were  I dont think we should go any further.",1976-09-23,Republican
Mr. Newman,Governor Carter.,1976-09-23,Moderator
Mr. Carter,"Well I think its uh very difficult for President Ford to uh  explain the difference between the pardon of President Nixon and  and uh  his attitude toward those who violated the draft laws. As a matter of fact  now- I dont advocate amnesty; I advocate pardon. Theres a difference in my opinion  uh and in accordance with the ruling of the Supreme Court and accordance with the definition in the dictionary. Amnesty means that  that you uh  that what you did was right. Pardon means that what you did, whether its right or wrong, youre forgiven for it. And I do advocate a pardon for  for draft evaders. I think its accurate to say that in uh  two years ago when Mr. Nixon  Mr. Ford put in this uh amnesty that three times as many deserters were uh  excused as were  as were the uh  the ones who evaded the draft. But I think that now is the time to heal our country after the Vietnam War and I think that what the people are concerned about is not the  uh pardon or the amnesty of uh  those who evaded the draft, but  but whether or not our crime system is  is fair. Weve got a  a sharp distinction drawn between white collar crime  the  the  the big shots who are rich, who are influential uh very seldom go to jail; those who are poor and  and who have uh no influence  uh quite often are the ones who are punished. And  and the whole uh subject of crime is one that concerns our people very much, and I believe that the fairness of it is  is what  uh  is a  is a major problem that addresses our  our leader and this is something that hasnt been addressed adequately by  by this administration. But I  I hope to have a complete uh responsibility on my shoulders to help bring about a  a fair uh  criminal justice system and also to  to bring about uh  an end to the  to the divise- divisiveness that has occurred in our country uh as a result of the Vietnam War.",1976-09-23,Democrat

Mr. Gannon,"Governor Carter, you have promised a sweeping overhaul of the federal government, including a reduction in the number of government agencies  you say it would go down about two hundred from some nineteen hundred. That sounds, indeed, like a very deep cut in the federal government. But isnt it a fact that youre not really talking about fewer federal employees or less government spending, but rather that you are talking about reshaping the federal government, not making it smaller?",1976-09-23,Moderator
Mr. Carter,"Well, Ive been through this before, Mr. Gannon, as the governor of Georgia. When I took aver we had uh a bureaucratic mess, like we have in Washington now, and we had three hundred agencies, departments, bureaus, commissions  uh some uh  fully budgeted, some not, but all having responsibility to carry out that was in conflict. And we cut those three hundred  uh agencies and so forth down substantially. We eliminated two hundred and seventy-eight of them. We set up a simple structure of government that could be administrated fairly and it was a  a tremendous success. It hasnt been undone since I was there. It resulted also in an ability to reshape our court system, our prison system, our education system, our mental health programs and  and a clear assignment of responsibility and  and authority and also to have uh our people once again understanding control our government. I intend to do the same thing if Im elected president. When I get to Washington, coming in as an outsider, one of the major responsibilities that  that I will have on my shoulder is a complete reorganization of the  of the executive branch of government. We now have uh  a greatly expanded White House staff. When Mr. Nixon went in office, for instance, we had three and a half million dollars spent on  on the White House and its staff. That has escalated now to sixteen and a half million dollars, in the last uh Republican administration. This needs to be changed. We need to put the responsibilities back on the cabinet members. We also need to have a great reduction in agencies and programs. For instance, we now have uh  in the health area three hundred and two different programs administered by eleven major departments and agencies, sixty other advisory commissions responsible for this. Medicaids in one agency; Medicare is in a different one. The  the check on the quality of health care is in a different one. None of them uh are responsible for health care itself. This makes it almost impossible for us to have a good health program. We have uh  just advocated uh  this past week a consolidation of the responsibilities for energy. Our country now has no comprehensive energy program or policy. We have twenty different agencies in the federal government responsible for the production, the regulation, the uh  information about energy, the conservation of energy, spread all over government. This is a  a gross waste of money, so tough, competent management of government, giving us a simple efficient purposeful and manageable government would be a great step forward and if Im elected  and I intend to be  then its gonna be done.",1976-09-23,Democrat
Mr. Gannon,"Well, Id like to  to press my question on the number of federal employees  whether you would really plan to reduce the overall  uh number, or  or merely put them in different departments and relabel them. Uh  in your energy plan, you consolidate a number of a  agencies into one, or you would, but uh does that really change the overall?",1976-09-23,Moderator
Mr. Carter,"I cant say for sure that we would have fewer federal employees when I go out of office than when I come in. It took me about three years to completely reorganize the Georgia government. The last year I was in office uh  our budget was  was actually less than it was a year before, uh which showed a great uh improvement. Also, we had a  a 2 percent increase in the number of employees the last year. But it was a tremendous shift from administrative jobs into the delivery of services. For instance, we uh  completely revised our prison system. We established eighty-four new mental health treatment centers. And we shifted people out of administrative jobs into the field to deliver better services. The same thing will be done uh  at the federal government level. I  I accomplished this with s  substantial reductions in employees in some departments. For instance, in the Transportation Department uh we had uh  we cut back about 25 percent of the total number of employees. In giving our people better mental health care, we increased the number of employees. But the efficiency of it, the simplicity of it, the uh ability of people to understand their own government and control it was a  was a uh  substantial benefit derived from complete reorganization. We uh  have got to do that at the federal government level. If we dont, the bureaucratic mess is going to continue. Theres no way for our people now to understand what their government is. Theres no way to get the answer to a question. When you come to Washington to try to  as a governor  to try to begin a new program for your people, like uh the treatment of drug addicts, I found there were thirteen different federal agencies that I had to go to, to manage the uh drug treatment program. In the Georgia government we only had one agency responsible for drug treatment. This is the kind of change that would be made. And uh  it would be of  of tremendous benefit in long-range planning, in tight budgeting, uh saving the taxpayers money, making the government more efficient, cutting down on bureaucratic waste, having a clear delineation of authority and responsibility of employees, and giving our people a better chance to understand and control their government.",1976-09-23,Democrat
Mr. Newman,President Ford.,1976-09-23,Moderator
Mr. Ford,"I think the record should show, Mr. Newman, that uh  the Bureau of Census  we checked it just yesterday  indicates that uh  in the four years that uh  Governor Carter was governor of the state of Georgia, uh  expenditures by the government went up over 50 percent Uh  employees of the government in Georgia during his term of office went up over 25 percent; and the figures also show that the uh, uh  bonded indebtedness of the state of Georgia during his governorship went up over 20 percent. And there was some very interesting testimony given by Governor Carters successor, Governor Busby, before a Senate committee a few uh  months ago on how he found the Medicaid program when he came into office following Governor Carter. He testified, and these are his words  the present governor of Georgia  he says he found the Medicaid program in Georgia in shambles. Now let me talk about what weve done in the White House as far as federal employees are concerned The first order that I issued after I became president was to cut or eliminate the prospective forty-thousand increase in federal employees that had been scheduled by my predecessor. And in the term that Ive been president  some two years  we have reduced federal employment by eleven thousand. In the White House staff itself, when I became president, we had roughly five hundred and forty employees. We now have about four hundred and eighty-five employees, so weve made a rather significant reduction in the number of employees on the White House staff working for the president. So I think our record of cutting back employees, plus the failure on the part of the Governors programs to actually save employment in Georgia, shows which is the better plan.",1976-09-23,Republican

Ms. Drew,"Mr. President, at Vail, after the Republican convention, you announced that you would now emphasize five new areas; among those were jobs and housing and health and improved recreational facilities for Americans. And you also added crime. You also mentioned education. For two years youve been telling us that we couldnt do very much in these areas because we couldnt afford it; and in fact we do have a $50 billion deficit now. In rebuttal to Governor Carter a little bit earlier, you said that if there were to be any surplus in the next few years you thought it should be turned back to the people in the form of tax relief. So how are you going to pay for any new initiatives in these areas you announced at Vail you were going to now stress?",1976-09-23,Moderator
Mr. Ford,"Well, in the uh  last two years, as I indicated before, we had a very tough time. We were faced with uh  heavy inflation, over 12 percent; we were faced with substantial unemployment. But in the last uh  twenty-four months weve turned the economy around and weve brought inflation down to under 6 percent, and we have reduced the uh  well, we have added employment of about four million in the last seventeen months to the point where we have eighty-eight million people working in America today  the most in the history of the country. The net result is we are going to have some improvement in our receipts. And I think well have some decrease in our disbursements. We expect to have a lower deficit in fiscal year 1978. We feel that with this improvement in the economy; we feel with more receipts and fewer disbursements we can in a moderate way increase, as I recommended, over the next ten years a new parks program that would cast a billion and a half dollars, doubling our national park system. We have recommended that in the h- housing program we can reduce down payments and moderate monthly payments. But that doesnt cost any more as far as the federal treasury is concerned. We believe that we can uh do a better job in the area of crime, but that requires a tougher sentencing, mandatory certain prison sentences for those who violate our criminal laws. We  uh believe that uh you can revise the federal criminal code, which has not been revised in a good many years. That doesnt cost any more money. We believe that you can uhh  do something more effectively with a moderate increase in money in the drug abuse program. We feel that uh  in education we can have a slight increase  not a major increase. Its my understanding that Governor Carter has indicated that uh  he approves of a $30 billion uh  expenditure by the federal government as far as education is concerned. At the present time were spending roughly three billion five hundred million dollars. I dont know where that money would come from. But as we look at the quality-of-life programs  jobs, health, education, crime, recreation  we feel that as we move forward with a healthier economy, we can absorb the small necessary cost that will be required.",1976-09-23,Republican
Ms. Drew,"Sir, in the next few years would you try to reduce the deficit, would you spend more money far these programs that you have just outlined, or would you, as you said earlier, return whatever surplus you got to the people in the form of tax relief?",1976-09-23,Moderator
Mr. Ford,"We feel that uh  with the programs that I have recommended, the additional $10 billion tax cut, with the moderate increases in the quality-of-life area, we can still have a balanced budget which I will submit to the Congress in January of 1978. We wont wait one year or two years longer, as Governor Carter uh  indicates. As the economy improves, and it is improving, our gross national product this year will average about 6 percent increase over last year. We will have the lower rate of inflation for the uh  calendar year this year  something slightly under 6 percent. Employment will be up, revenues will be up. Well keep the lid on some of these programs that we can hold down as we have a little extra money to spend for those quality-of-life programs which I think are needed and necessary. Now I cannot, and would not, endorse the kind of program that uh  Governor Carter recommends. He endorses the Democratic uh  platform which, as I read it, calls for approximately sixty additional programs. We estimate that those programs would add a hundred billion dollars minimum and probably two hundred billion dollars  uhh maximum each year to the federal budget. Those programs you cannot afford and give tax relief. We feel that you can hold the line and restrain federal spending, give a tax reduction and still have a balanced budget by 1978.",1976-09-23,Republican
Mr. Newman,Governor Carter.,1976-09-23,Moderator
Mr. Carter,"Well, Mr. Ford takes the uh  same attitude that the Republicans always take. In the last three months before an election, theyre always for the programs that they always fight the other three-and-one-half years. Uh  I remember when uh  Herbert Hoover was against uh  jobs for people. I remember when Alf Landon was against Social Security and uh  later President Nixon, sixteen years ago, was telling the public that John Kennedys proposals would bankrupt the country and would double the cost. The best thing to do is to look at the record uh  of Mr. Fords Administration and Mr. Nixons before his. Uh  we had last year a $65 billion deficit  the largest deficit in the history of our country  more of a deficit spending than we had in the entire eight-year period under President Johnson and President Kennedy. Weve got five hundred thousand more Americans out of jobs today than were out of work three months ago and since Mr. Fords been in office two years, weve had a 50 percent increase in unemployment from five million people out of work to two and a half million more people out of work and a total of seven and a half million. Weve also got uh  a comparison between himself and Mr. Nixon. Hes got four times the size of the deficits that Mr. Nixon even had himself. This uh  talking about more people at work  uh is distorted because with a 14 percent increase in the cost of living in the last uh  two years, it means that  that women and young people have had to go to work when they didnt want to because their fathers didnt make enough to pay the increased cost of uh  food and uh housing and clothing. We have uh  in this last uh two years alone a hundred and twenty billion dollars total deficits under President Ford and uh  at the same time weve had, in the last eight years, a doubling in the number of bankruptcies for small business: weve had a negative growth in our  in our national economy measured in real dollars. The take-home pay of a worker in this country is actually less now than it was in 1968  measured in real dollars. This is the kind of record thats there and talk about the future and a drastic change or conversion on the part of Mr. Ford as of last minute is one that just doesnt go.",1976-09-23,Democrat

Mr. Reynolds,"Governor Carter, Id like to turn uh  to what we used to call the energy crisis. Yesterday a British uh  government commission on air pollution, but one headed by a nuclear physicist, recommended that any further expansion of nuclear energy be delayed in Britain as long as possible. Now this is a subject that is quite controversial among our own people and there seems to be a clear difference between you and the President on the use of nuclear power plants, which you say you would use as a last priority. Why, sir, are they unsafe?",1976-09-23,Moderator
Mr. Carter,"Well among my other experiences in the past, Ive  Ive been a nuclear engineer, and did graduate work in this field. I think I know the  the uh capabilities and limitations of atomic power. But the energy  uh policy of our nation is one that uh has not yet been established under this administration. I think almost every other developed nation in the world has an energy policy except us. We have seen uh  the Federal Energy Agency established, for instance. Uh  in the crisis of 1973 it was supposed to be a temporary agency, uh now its permanent, its enormous, its growing every day. I think the Wall Street Journal uh reported not too long ago they have a hundred and twelve public relations experts working for the Federal Energy Agency to try to justify to the American people its own existence. Weve got to have a  a firm way to handle the energy question. The reorganization proposal that I have put forward is one uh first step. In addition to that, we need to have  uh a realization that weve got uh about thirty-five years worth of oil left in the whole world. Were gonna run out of oil. When Mr. Nixon made his famous uh speech on Operation Independence we were importing about 35 percent of our oil. Now weve increased that amount 25 percent. We now import about 44 percent of our oil. We need to shift from oil to coal. We need to concentrate our research and development effort on uh coal burning and extraction, with safer mines, but also its clean burning. We need to shift very strongly toward solar energy and have strict conservation measures. And then as a last resort only, continue to use atomic power. I would certainly uh  not cut out atomic power altogether. We cant afford to give up that opportunity until later. But to the extent that we continue to use atomic power, I would be responsible as president to make sure that the safety precautions were initiated and maintained. For instance, some that have been forgotten; we need to have the reactor core  below ground level, the entire power plant that uses atomic uh  power tightly sealed and a heavy  heavy vacuum maintained. There ought to be a standardized design. There ought to be a full-time uh  atomic energy specialist, independent of the power company in the control room, full time, twenty-four hours a day, to shut down a plant if an abnormality develops. These kinds of uh  procedures, along with evacuation procedures, adequate insurance, ought to be initiated. So, shift from oil to coal, emphasize research and development on coal use and also on solar power, strict conservation measures, not yield every time that the special interest groups uh  put pressure on the president like uh this administration has done, and use atomic energy only as a last resort with the strictest possible safety precautions. Thats the best overall energy policy in the brief time we have to discuss it.",1976-09-23,Democrat
Mr. Reynolds,"Well Governor, on that same subject, would you require mandatory conservation efforts to try to conserve fuel?",1976-09-23,Moderator
Mr. Carter,"Yes, I would. Some of the things that can be done about this is a change in the rate structure of electric power companies. We uh  now encourage people to waste electricity, and uh  by giving uh  the lowest rates to the biggest users. We dont do anything to cut down on peak load requirements. We dont have an adequate requirement for the insulation of homes, for the efficiency of automobiles. And whenever the uh  automobile manufacturers come forward and say they cant meet the uh  amendments that the Congress has put forward, this Republican administration has delayed the implementation dates. In addition to that, we ought to have a  a shift toward the use of coal, particularly in the Appalachian regions where the coal is located. A lot of uh  very high quality, low-carbon coal, uh  low-sulfur coal is there, its where our employment is needed. Uh  this would  would help a great deal. So mandatory conservation measures  yes. Encouragement by the president for people to uh voluntarily conserve  yes. And also the private sector ought to be encouraged to  to bring forward to the public the benefits from efficiency. One bank in uh  Washington, fo- for instance, gives lower interest loans for people who adequately insulate their homes or who buy efficient automobiles. And some major uh  uh  manufacturing companies, like Dow Chemical, have through uh  very effective efficiency mechanism cut down the use of energy by uh  as much as 40 percent with the same out-product. These kinds of things uh  ought to be done, uh they ought to be encouraged and supported, and even required uh by the government, yes.",1976-09-23,Democrat
Mr. Newman,President Ford.,1976-09-23,Moderator
Mr. Ford,"Governor Carter skims over a very serious and a very broad subject. In January of uh  1975 I submitted to the Congress and to the American people the first comprehensive energy program recommended by any president. It called for an increase in the production of energy in the United States. It called for uh  conservation measures so that we would save the energy that we have. If youre going to increase domestic oil and gas production  and we have to  you have to give those producers an opportunity to uh  develop their land or their wells. I recommended to the Congress that we should increase production in this country from six hundred million tons a year to twel- a- a billion two hundred million tons by 1985. In order to do that we have to improve our extraction of coal from the ground; we have to improve our utilization of coal  make it more efficient, make it cleaner. In addition we uh  have to expand our research and development. In my program for energy independence we have increased, for example, solar energy research from about $84 million a year to about a hundred and twenty million dollars a year. Were going as fast as the experts say we should. In nuclear power we have increased the research and development, uh  under the Energy Research and Development Agency uh  very substantially, to insure that our ener- uh  nuclear power plants are safer, that they are more efficient, and that we have adequate safeguards. I think you have to have greater oil and gas production, more coal production, more nuclear production, and in addition you have to have energy conservation.",1976-09-23,Republican
Mr. Newman,Mr. Gannon.,1976-09-23,Moderator
Mr. Gannon,"Mr. President, Id like to return for a moment to this problem of unemployment. You have vetoed or threatened to veto number of job bills passed or uh  in development in the Democratic Congress  Democratic-controlled Congress. Yet at the same time the government is paying out, uh  I think it is $17 billion, perhaps $20 billion a year in unemployment compensation caused by the high unemployment. Why do you think it is better to pay out unemployment compensation to idle people than to put them to work in public service jobs?",1976-09-23,Moderator
Mr. Ford,"The bills that I vetoed, the one for an additional $6 billion, was not a bill that would have solved our unemployment problems. Even the proponents of it admitted that no more than four hundred thousand jobs would be uh  made available. Our analysis indicates that something in the magnitude of about one hundred fifty to two hundred thousand jobs would uh  be made available. Each one of those jobs wouldve cost the taxpayers $25 thousand. In addition, the jobs would not be available right now. They would not have materialized for about nine to eighteen months. The immediate problem we have is to stimulate our economy now so that we can get rid of unemployment. What we have done is to hold the lid on spending in an effort to reduce the rate of inflation. And we have proven, I think very conclusively, that you can reduce the rate of inflation and increase jobs. For example, as I have said, we have added some four million jobs in the last seventeen months. We have now employed eighty-eight million people in America, the largest number in the history of the United States. Weve added five hundred thousand jobs in the last two months. Inflation is the quickest way to destroy jobs. And by holding the lid on federal spending we have been able to do an- a good job, an affirmative job in inflation and as a result have added to the jobs in this country. I think its uh  also appropriate to point out that through our tax policies we have stimulated uhh  added employment throughout the country, the investment tax credit, the tax incentives for expansion and modernization of our industrial capacity. Its my  my opinion that the private sector, where five out of six jobs are, where you have permanent jobs, with the opportunity for advancement, is a better place than make-work jobs under the program recommended by the Congress.",1976-09-23,Republican
Mr. Gannon,"Just to follow up, Mr. President: the  the Congress has just passed a three point seven billion dollar appropriation bill which would provide money for the public works jobs program that you earlier tried to kill by your veto of the authorization legislation. In light of the fact that uh  unemployment again is rising  or has in the past three months  I wonder if you have rethought that question at all; whether you would consider uh  allowing this program to be funded, or will you veto that money bill?",1976-09-23,Moderator
Mr. Ford,"Well, that bill has not yet come down to the Oval Office, so I am not in a position to make any judgment on it tonight. But that is an extra $4 billion that would uh  add to the deficit which would add to the inflationary pressures, which would help to destroy jobs in the private sector  not make jobs, where the jobs really are. These make-work, temporary jobs  dead end as they are  are not the kind of jobs that we want for our people. I think its interesting to point out that uh  in the uh  two years that Ive been president Ive vetoed fifty-six bills. Congress has sustained forty-two vetoes. As a result, we have saved over $9 billion in federal expenditures. And the Congress by overriding the bills that I did veto, the Congress has added some $13 billion to the federal expenditures and to the federal deficit. Now Governor Carter complains about the deficits that uh  uh  this administration has had. And yet he condemns the vetoes that I have made that has  that have saved the taxpayer $9 billion and could have saved an additional $13 billion. Now he cant have it both ways. And therefore, it seems to me that we should hold the lid, as we have, to the best of our ability so we can stimulate the private economy and get the jobs where the jobs are  five out of six in this economy.",1976-09-23,Republican
Mr. Newman,Governor Carter.,1976-09-23,Moderator
Mr. Carter,"Well, Mr. Ford doesnt seem to put into perspective the fact that when  when uh five hundred thousand more people are out of work than there were three months ago, while we have two and a half million more people out of work than were when he took office, that this touches human beings. I was in uh  a city in uh  Pennsylvania not too long ago, near here, and uh  there were about four or five thousand people in the audience  it was on a  on a train trip. And I said, How many uh  adults here are out of work? About a thousand raised their hands. Mr. Ford uh  actually has fewer people now in the private sector in non-farm jobs than when he took office. And still he talks about  uh success. Seven point nine percent unemployment is a terrible tragedy in this country. He says hes learned how to match unemployment with inflation. Thats right. Weve got the highest inflation weve had in twenty-five years right now, except under this administration, and that was fifty years ago. And weve got uh  the highest unemployment weve had uh  under Mr. Fords administration, since the Great Depression. This affects human beings, and  and his insensitivity in providing those people a chance to work has made this a welfare administration, and not a work administration. He hasnt saved $9 billion with his vetoes. Theres only been uh  a net savings of $4 billion. And the cost in unemployment compensation, welfare compensation, and lost revenues has increased $23 billion in the last two years. This is a  a typical attitude that really causes havoc in peoples lives, and then its covered over by saying that our country has naturally got a 6 percent unemployment rate, or 7 percent unemployment rate and a 6 percent inflation. Its a travesty. It shows a lack of leadership. And weve never had a president since the War between the States that vetoed more bills. Mr. Ford has vetoed four times as many bills as Mr. Nixon  per year. And eleven of em have been overridden. One of his bills that was overridden  he only got one vote in the Senate and seven votes in the House, from Republicans.",1976-09-23,Democrat

Ms. Drew,"Governor Carter, Id like to come back to the subject of taxes. You have said that you want to cut taxes for the middle and lower income groups.",1976-09-23,Moderator
Mr. Carter,Right.,1976-09-23,Democrat
Ms. Drew,"But unless youre willing to do such things as reduce the itemized deductions for charitable contributions or home mortgage payments, or interest, or taxes, or capital gains, you cant really raise sufficient revenue to provide an overall tax cut of any size. So how are you gonna provide that tax relief that youre talking about?",1976-09-23,Moderator
Mr. Carter,"Now we have uh such a grossly unbalanced tax system  as I said earlier, that it is a disgrace  ah of all the tax  benefits now, 25 percent of em go to the 1 percent of the richest people in this country. Over 50 percent  53 to be exact  percent of the tax benefits go to the 14 percent richest people in this country, and weve had a 50 percent increase in payroll deductions since Mr. Nixon went in office eight years ago. Mr. Ford has  has advocated since hes been in office over $5 billion in reductions for corporations, special interest groups, and the very, very wealthy who derive their income  not from labor  but from investments. Thats got to be changed. A few things that can be done: we have now a deferral system so that the multinational corporations who invest overseas  if they make a million dollars in profits overseas  they dont have to pay any of their taxes unless they bring their money back into this country. When they dont pay their taxes, the average American pays the taxes for them. Not only that, but it robs this country of jobs, because instead of coming back with that million dollars and creating a shoe factory, say in New Hampshire or Vermont, if the company takes the money down to Italy and  and builds a shoe factory, they dont have to pay any taxes on the money. Another thing is a system called DISC which was originally designed, proposed by Mr. Nixon, to encourage exports. This permits a company to create uh  a dummy corporation, to export their products, and then not to pay the full amount of taxes on them. This costs our uh  government about uh  $1.4 billion a year. And when those rich corporations dont pay that tax, the average American taxpayer pays it for em. Another one thats uh  thats very important is the uh  is the business deductions, uh  jet airplanes, uh  first class travel, the fifty-dollar martini lunch. The average working person cant  uh  cant take advantage of that, but the  the wealthier people  uh can. Uh  another system is where uhh  a dentist can invest money in say, raising cattle and uh  can put in a hundred thousand dollars of his own money, borrow nine hundred thousand dollars  nine hundred mi- thousand dollars  that makes a million  and mark off a great amount of uh  of loss uh  through that procedure. Uh  there was one example, for instance, where uh  somebody uh  produced pornographic movies. They put in $30 thousand of their own money and got a hundred and twenty thousand dollars in tax savings. Well, these special kinds of programs have  have robbed the average taxpayer and have benefited those who are powerful, and who can employ lobbyists, and who can have their CPAs and their lawyers to help them benefit from the roughly uh  eight thousand pages of the tax code. The average uh American person cant do it. You cant hire a lobbyist uh out of unemployment compensation checks.",1976-09-23,Democrat
Ms. Drew,"Ah  Governor, to follow up on your answer. Uh  in order for any kind of tax relief to really be felt by the middle and lower-income people",1976-09-23,Moderator
Mr. Carter,"Yes. You need about, according to Congressional committees on this, you need about $10 billion. Now you listed some things  the uh  deferral on foreign income as estimated: that would save about $500 million. DISC, you said, was about 1.4 billion. uh  The estimate of the outside, if you eliminated all tax shelters, is 5 billion. So where else would you raise the revenue to provide this tax relief  would you, in fact, do away with all business deductions, and what other kinds of preferences would you do away with?",1976-09-23,Democrat
Mr. Carter,"No, I wouldnt do away with all  uh business deductions. I think that would be a  a very serious mistake. But uh  if  if you could just do away with the ones that are unfair, you could lower taxes for everyone. I would never do anything that would increase the taxes for those who work for a living, or who are presently required to list all their income. What I wanna do is not to raise taxes, but to eliminate loopholes. And this is uh  the point of my first statistics that I gave you  that  that the present tax benefits that have been carved out over a long period of years  fifty years  by sharp tax lawyers and by lobbyists have benefited just the rich. These programs that I described to you earlier  the tax deferrals for overseas, the DISC, and the tax shelters, uh  they only apply to people in the $50 thousand-a-year bracket or up, and I think this is the very best way to approach it. Its to make sure that everybody pays taxes on the income that they earn and make sure that you take whatever savings there is from the higher income levels and give it to the lower- and middle-income families.",1976-09-23,Democrat
Mr. Newman,President Ford.,1976-09-23,Moderator
Mr. Ford,"Governor Carters answer tonight does not coincide with the answer that he gave in an interview to the Associated Press a week or so ago. In that interview uh  Governor Carter indicated that uh  he would raise the taxes on those in the medium or middle-income brackets or higher. Now if you uh  take the medium or middle-income taxpayer  thats about $14 thousand per person  uh  Governor Carter has indicated, publicly, in an interview that he would increase the taxes on about 50 percent of the working people of this country. I think uh  the way to get tax equity in this country is to give tax relief to the middle-income people who have an income from roughly $8 thousand up to twenty-five or thirty thousand dollars. They have been short-changed as we have taken ten million taxpayers off the tax rolls in the last eight years, and as we have uh  added to the minimum tax uh  provision to make all people pay more taxes. I believe in tax equity for the middle-income taxpayer, increasing the personal exemption. Mr. Carter wants to increase taxes for roughly half of the taxpayers of this country. Now, the Governor has also played a little fast and loose with the facts about vetoes. The records show that President Roosevelt vetoed an average of fifty-five bills a year. President Truman vetoed on the average, while he was president, about thirty-eight bills a year. I understand that Governor Carter, when he was Governor of Georgia, vetoed between thirty-five and forty bills a year. My average in two years is twenty-six. But in the process of that we have saved uhh  $9 billion. And one final comment, uh  Governor Carter talks about the tax bills and all of the inequities that exist in the present law. I must remind him the Democrats have controlled the Congress for the last twenty-two years and they wrote all the tax bills.",1976-09-23,Republican
Mr. Newman,Mr. Reynolds.,1976-09-23,Moderator
Mr. Reynolds,"I suspect that uhh  we could continue on this tax argument for some time. But Id like to move on to another area. Mr. President, uh everybody seems to be running against Washington this year. And Id like to raise two coincidental events and ask you whether you think perhaps this may have a bearing on the attitude throughout the country. The House Ethics Committee has just now ended its investigation of Daniel Schorr, after several months and many thousands of dollars, trying to find out how he obtained and caused to be published a report of the Congress that probably is the property of the American people. At the same time. the Senate Select Committee on Standards and Conduct has voted not really to begin an investigation of a United States senator because of allegations against him that he may have been receiving corporate funds illegally over a period of years. Do you suppose, sir, that events like this contribute to the feeling in the country that maybe theres something wrong in Washington, and I dont mean just in the executive branch but throughout the whole government?",1976-09-23,Moderator
Mr. Ford,"There is a considerable anti-Washington feeling throughout the country. But I think the feeling is misplaced. In the last two years, we have restored integrity in the White House, and weve set high standards in the executive branch of the government. The anti-Washington feeling, in my opinion, ought to be focused on the Congress of the United States. For example, this Congress, very shortly, will spend a billion dollars a year for its housekeeping, its salaries, its expenses and the like. It  the next Congress will probably be the first billion-dollar Congress in the history of the United States. I dont think the American people are getting their moneys worth from the majority party that run this Congress. We, in addition, see that uh  in the last uh  four years the number of employees hired by the Congress has gone up substantial- uh much more than uh  the gross national product, much more than any other increase throughout our society. Congress is hiring people by the droves, and the cast as a result has gone up. And I dont see any improvement in the performance of the Congress under the present leadership. So it seems to me instead of the anti-Washington feeling being aimed at everybody in Washington, it seems to me that the focus should be where the problem is, which is the Congress of the United States, and particularly the majority in the Congress. They spend too much money on themselves. They have too many employees. Theres some question about their morality. It seems to me that in this election, the focus should not be on the executive branch but the corrections should come as the voters vote for their members of the House of Representatives or for their United States senator. Thats where the problem is and I hope therell be some corrective action taken so we can get some new leadership in the Congress of the United States.",1976-09-23,Republican
Mr. Reynolds,"Mr. President, if I may follow up. Uh  I think youve made it plain that you take a dim view of the uh  majority in the Congress. Isnt it quite likely, sir, that you will have a Democratic Congress in the next session, if you are elected president? And hasnt the country uh  a right to ask whether you can get along with that Congress, or whether well have continued confrontation?",1976-09-23,Moderator
Mr. Ford,"Well, It seems to me that uh  we have a chance  the Republicans  to get a majority in the House of Representatives. We will make some gains in the United States Senate. So there will be different ratios in the House, as well as in the Senate, and as president I will be able to uh  work with that Congress. But let me take the other side of the coin, if I might. Supposing we had  had a Democratic Congress for the last two years and wed had uh  Governor Carter as President. He has, in effect, said that he would agree with all of  he would disapprove of the vetoes that I have made, and would have added significantly to expenditures and the deficit in the federal government. I think it would be contrary to one of the basic concepts in our system of government  a system of checks and balances. We have a Democratic Congress today, and fortunately weve had a Republican president to check their excesses with my vetoes. If we have a Democratic Congress next year, and a president who wants to spend an additional one hundred billion dollars a year, or maybe two hundred billion dollars a year, with more programs, we will have in my judgment, greater deficits with more spending, more dangers of inflation. I think the American people want a Republican president to check on any excesses that come out of the next Congress, if it is a Democratic Congress.",1976-09-23,Republican
Mr. Newman,Governor Carter.,1976-09-23,Moderator
Mr. Carter,"Well, its not a matter of uh  Republican and Democrat. Its a matter of leadership or no leadership. President Eisenhower worked with a Democratic Congress very well. Even President Nixon, because he was a strong leader at least, worked with a Democratic Congress very well. Uh  Mr. Ford has vetoed, as I said earlier, four times as many bills per year as Mr. Nixon. Mr. Ford quite often puts forward a program just as a public relations stunt, and never tries to put it through the Congress by working with the Congress. I think under presidents For- uh  Nixon and Eisenhower they passed about 60 to 75 percent of their legislation. This year Mr. Ford will not pass more than 26 percent of all the legislative proposals he puts forward. This is government by stalemate, and weve seen almost a complete breakdown in the proper relationship between the president, who represents this country, and the Congress, who collectively also represent this country. Weve had uh  Republican presidents before whove tried to run against a Democratic  uh Congress. And I dont think its uh  the Congress is Mr. Fords opponent; but if uh  if  if he insists that uh  that I be responsible for the Democratic Congress, of which Im  have not been a part, then I think its only fair that he be responsible for the Nixon administration in its entirety, of which he was a part. That, I think, is a good balance. But the point is, that  that a president ought to lead this country. Mr. Ford, so far as I know, except for avoiding another Watergate, has not accomplished one single major program for this country. And theres been a constant squabbling between the president and the Congress, and thats not the way this country ought to be run. I might go back to one other thing. Mr. Ford has uh  misquoted an AP uh  news story that was in error to begin with. That story reported several times that I would lower taxes for low and middle-income families and uh  that correction was delivered to the White House and I am sure that the president knows about this uh  correction, but he still insists uh  on repeating an erroneous statement.",1976-09-23,Democrat
Mr. Newman,"President Ford, Governor Carter, we no longer have enough time for two complete sequences of questions. We have only about six minutes left for questions and answers. For that reason we will drop the follow-up questions at this point but each candidate will still be able to respond to the others answers. Uh  to the extent that you can, gentlemen, please keep your remarks brief. Mr. Gannon.",1976-09-23,Moderator
Mr. Gannon,"Governor Carter, one uh  important uh  part of the Governments economic policy uh  apparatus we havent talked about is the Federal Reserve Board. Id like to ask you something about what youve said and that is that uh  you believe that a president ought to have a chairman of the Federal Reserve Board whose views are compatible with his own. Based on the record of the last few years, would you say that your views are compatible with those of Chairman Arthur Burns? And if not, would you seek his resignation if you are elected?",1976-09-23,Moderator
Mr. Carter,"What I have said is that the president ought to have a chance to appoint a chairman of the Federal Reserve Board to have a coterminous uh term; in other words, both of em serve the same four  four years. The Congress can modify the supply of money by modifying the income uh tax laws. The president can modify the uh  economic structure of a country by public statements and general attitudes in the budget that he proposes. The Federal Reserve has uh  an independent status that ought to be preserved; I think that Mr. uh  Burns did take a typical, erroneous Republican attitude in the 1973 year when inflation was so high. They assumed that the uh  inflation rate was because of excessive demand and uh  therefore put into effect tight constraint on the economy, very high interest rates, which is typical also of the Republican administration, uh  tried to increase the uh  the tax uh  payments by individuals, and cut the tax payments by corporations. I would have uh  done it opposite. I think the uh  problem shouldve been addressed by increasing productivity, by having uh  put  put people back to work so they could purchase more goods, lower income taxes on individuals, perhaps raise them, if necessary, on corporations in comparison. But uh  Mr. Burns uh  in that respect made a very serious mistake. I would not wanna destroy the  the independence of the uh Federal Reserve  uh Board. But I do think we ought to have a cohesive economic policy with at  at least the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board and the presidents terms being uh  the same and letting the Congress, of course, be the third uh  entity with uh  with independence subject only to the presidents veto.",1976-09-23,Democrat
Mr. Newman,"President Ford, your response.",1976-09-23,Moderator
Mr. Ford,"The chairman of the Federal Reserve Board should be independent. Fortunately, he has been during Democratic as well as Republican administrations. As the result in the last uh  two years uh  we have had a responsible monetary policy. Uh the Federal Reserve Board indicated that the supply of money would be held between four to four and a half and seven and seven and a half. They have done a good job in integrating the money supply with the uh  fiscal policy of the uh  executive and legislative branches of the government. It would be catastrophic if the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board became the tool of the political uh  party that was in power. Its important for our future uhh  economic security that that job be nonpolitical and uh  separate from the executive and the Legislative branches.",1976-09-23,Republican
Mr. Newman,Mrs. Drew.,1976-09-23,Moderator
Ms. Drew,"Uh Mr. President, the real problem with the FBI and, in fact, all of the intelligence agencies is there are no real laws governing them. Such laws as there are tend to be vague and open-ended. Now, you have issued some executive orders, but weve learned that leaving these agencies to executive discretion and direction can get them and, in fact, the country in a great deal of trouble. One president may be a decent man, the next one might not be. So, what do you think about trying to write in some more protection by getting some laws governing these agencies?",1976-09-23,Moderator
Mr. Ford,"You are familiar, of course, with the fact that I am the first president in thirty years who has reorganized the intelligence agencies in the federal government: the CIA, the Defense Intelligence Agency, the National Security Agency and the others. Weve done that by executive order. Uhh  and I think uh  weve tightened it up; weve uh  straightened out their problems that developed over the last few years. It doesnt seem to me that its needed or necessary to have legislation in this particular regard. Uhh  I have recommended to the Congress, however  Im sure youre familiar with this  legislation that would uhh  make it uhh  very uhh  proper in  in the right way, that the attorney general could go in and get the right for wiretapping under security cases. This was an effort that was made by the attorney general and myself, working with the Congress. But even in this area, where I think new legislation would be justified, uh the Congress has not responded. So, I feel in that case, as well as in the reorganization of the intelligence agencies, as Ive done, we have to do it by executive order. And Im glad that we have a good director in George Bush. We have good executive orders, and the CIA and the DIA and NASA uh  uh  NSA are now doing a good job under proper supervision.",1976-09-23,Republican

Mr. Carter,"Well, tonight weve had a chance to talk a lot about the past. But I think its time to talk about the future. Our nation in the last eight years has been divided as never before. Its a time for unity. Its a time to draw ourselves together: to have a president and a Congress that can work together with mutual respect for a change, cooperating for a change, in the open for a change, so the people can understand their own government. Its time for government, industry, labor, manufacturing, agriculture, education, other entities in our society to cooperate. And its a time for government to understand and to cooperate with our people. For a long time our American citizens have been excluded, sometimes misled, sometimes have been lied to. This is uh  not compatible with the purpose of our nation. I believe in our country. It needs to be competent. The government needs to be well-managed, efficient, economical, We need to have a government thats sensitive to our peoples needs  to those who are poor, who dont have adequate health care, who have been cheated too long with our tax programs, whove been out of jobs, whose families have been torn apart. We need to restore the faith and the trust of the American people in their own government. In addition to that, weve suffered because we havent had leadership in this administration. Weve got a government of stalemate. Weve lost the vision of what our country can and ought to be. This is not the America that weve known in the past. Its not the America that we have to have in the future. I dont claim to know all the answers. But Ive got confidence in my country. Our economic strength is still there. Our system of government  in spite of Vietnam, Cambodia, CIA, Watergate  is still the best system of government on earth. And the greatest resource of all are the two hundred and fifteen million Americans who have within us the strength, the character, the intelligence, the experience, the patriotism, the idealism, the compassion, the sense of brotherhood on which we can rely in the future to restore the greatness to our country We ought not to be excluded from our government anymore. We need a president who can go in  who derives his strength from the people. I owe the special interests nothing. I owe everything to you, the people of this country. And I believe that we can bind our wounds. I believe that we can work together. And I believe that if we can tap the tremendous untapped reservoir of innate strength in this country, that we can once again have a government as good as our people, and let the world know what we still know and hope for  that we still live in the greatest and the strongest and the best country on earth.",1976-09-23,Democrat

Mr. Ford,"On November second all of you will make a very, very important decision. One of the major issues in this campaign is trust. A president should never promise more than he can deliver and a president should always deliver everything that hes promised. A president cant be all things to all people. A president should be the same thing to all people. Another issue in this campaign, Governor Carter has endorsed the Democratic platform, which calls for more spending, bigger deficits, more inflation or mare taxes. Governor Carter has embraced the record of the present Congress, dominated by his political party. It calls for more of the same. Governor Carter in his acceptance speech called for more and more programs, which means more and more government. I think the real issue in this campaign, and that which you must decide on November second, is whether you should vote for his promise or my performance in two years in the White House. On the fourth of July we had a wonderful two hundredth birthday  for our great country. It was a superb occasion. It was a glorious day. In the first century of our nations history our forefathers gave us the finest form of government in the history of mankind. In the second century of our nations history, our forefathers developed the most productive industrial nation in the history of the globe. Our third century should be the century of individual freedom for all our two hundred and fifteen million Americans today and all that join us. In the last few years government has gotten bigger and bigger; industry has gotten larger and larger; labor unions have gotten bigger and bigger; and our children have been the victims of mass education. We must make this next century the century of the individual. We should never forget that a government big enough to give us everything we want is a government big enough to take from us everything we have. The individual worker in the plants throughout the United States should not be a small cog in a big machine. The member of a labor union must have his rights strengthened and broadened and our children in their education should have an opportunity to improve themselves based on their talents and their abilities. My mother and father, during the Depression, worked very hard to give me an opportunity to do better in our great country. Your mothers and fathers did the same thing for you and others. Betty and I have worked very hard to give our children a brighter future in the United States, our beloved country. You and others in this great country have worked hard and done a great deal to give your children and your grandchildren the blessings of a better America.

Im Chris Wallace of Fox News and I welcome you to the first of the 2020 presidential debates between President Donald J. Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden. This debate is sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates. The Commission has designed the format, six roughly 15-minute segments with two-minute answers from each candidate to the first question, then open discussion for the rest of each segment. Both campaigns have agreed to these rules. For the record, I decided the topics and the questions in each topic. I can assure you none of the questions has been shared with the Commission or the two candidates. This debate is being conducted under health and safety protocols designed by the Cleveland Clinic, which is serving as the health security advisor to the Commission for all four debates. As a precaution, both campaigns have agreed the candidates will not shake hands at the beginning of tonights debate. The audience here in the hall has promised to remain silent. No cheers, no boos, or other interruptions so we, and more importantly you, can focus on what the candidates have to say.

President Trump, you nominated Amy Coney Barrett over the weekend to succeed the late Ruth Bader Ginsburg on the Court. You say the Constitution is clear about your obligation and the Senates to consider a nominee to the Court. Vice President Biden, you say that this is an effort by the President and Republicans to jam through on an appointment in what you call an abuse of power. My first question to both of you tonight, why are you right in the argument you make and your opponent wrong? And where do you think a Justice Barrett would take the court? President Trump, in this first segment, you go first. Two minutes.",2020-09-29,Moderator
Trump,"Thank you very much, Chris. I will tell you very simply. We won the election. Elections have consequences. We have the Senate, we have the White House, and we have a phenomenal nominee respected by all. Top, top academic, good in every way. Good in every way. In fact, some of her biggest endorsers are very liberal people from Notre Dame and other places. So I think shes going to be fantastic. We have plenty of time. Even if we did it after the election itself. I have a lot of time after the election, as you know. So I think that she will be outstanding. Shes going to be as good as anybody that has served on that court. We really feel that. We have a professor at Notre Dame, highly respected by all, said shes the single greatest student hes ever had. Hes been a professor for a long time at a great school. And we won the election and therefore we have the right to choose her, and very few people knowingly would say otherwise. And by the way, the Democrats, they wouldnt even think about not doing it. The only difference is theyd try and do it faster. Theres no way they would give it up. They had Merrick Garland, but the problem is they didnt have the election so they were stopped. And probably that would happen in reverse, also. Definitely would happen in reverse. So we won the election and we have the right to do it, Chris.",2020-09-29,Republican

Biden,"The American people have a right to have a say in who the Supreme Court nominee is and that say occurs when they vote for United States Senators and when they vote for the President of United States. Theyre not going to get that chance now because were in the middle of an election already. The election has already started. Tens of thousands of people already voted and so the thing that should happen is we should wait. We should wait and see what the outcome of this election is because thats the only way the American people get to express their view is by who they elect as President and who they elect as Vice President. Now, whats at stake here is the Presidents made it clear, he wants to get rid of the Affordable Care Act. Hes been running on that, he ran on that and hes been governing on that. Hes in the Supreme Court right now trying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act, which will strip 20 million people from having health insurance now, if it goes into court. And the justice, Im not opposed to the justice, she seems like a very fine person. But shes written, before she went in the bench, which is her right, that she thinks that the Affordable Care Act is not Constitutional. The other thing thats on the court, and if its struck down, what happens? Womens rights are fundamentally changed. Once again, a woman could pay more money because she has a pre-existing condition of pregnancy. Theyre able to charge women more for the same exact procedure a man gets. And that ended when we, in fact, passed the Affordable Care Act, and theres a hundred million people who have pre-existing conditions and theyll be taken away as well. Those pre-existing conditions, insurance companies are going to love this. And so its just not appropriate to do this before this election. If he wins the election and the Senate is Republican, then he goes forward. If not, we should wait until February.",2020-09-29,Democrat
Trump,"There arent a hundred million people with pre-existing conditions. As far as a say is concerned, the people already had their say.

Biden,"The platform of the Democratic Party is what I, in fact, approved of, what I approved of. Now, heres the deal. The deal is that its going to wipe out pre-existing conditions. And, by the way, the 200,000 people that have died on his watch, how many of those have survived? Well, theres seven million people that contracted COVID. What does it mean for them going forward if you strike down the Affordable Care Act?",2020-09-29,Democrat

Wallace,"You, in the course of these four years, have never come up with a comprehensive plan to replace Obamacare, and just this last Thursday you signed a largely symbolic Executive Order to protect people with pre-existing conditions five days before this debate. So my question, sir, is what is the Trump healthcare plan?",2020-09-29,Moderator
Trump,"Well, first of all, I guess Im debating you, not him, but thats okay. Im not surprised. Let me just tell you something. Theres nothing symbolic. Im cutting drug prices. Im going with Favored Nations, which no President has the courage to do because youre going against big pharma. Drug prices will be coming down 80 or 90%. You could have done it during your 47-year period in government, but you didnt do it. Nobodys done it. So were cutting healthcare.",2020-09-29,Republican

Biden,Yes.,2020-09-29,Democrat
Wallace,And the argument that he makes and other Republicans make is that that is going to end private insurance.,2020-09-29,Moderator
Biden,It is not.,2020-09-29,Democrat
Wallace,If I start asking the question.,2020-09-29,Moderator
Trump,"Thats not what your party says, by the way.",2020-09-29,Republican
Wallace,And it will end private insurance and create a government takeover of healthcare.,2020-09-29,Moderator
Biden,"It does not. Its only for those people who are so poor they qualify for Medicaid they can get that free in most States, except Governors who want to deny people who are poor Medicaid. Anyone who qualifies for Medicaid would automatically be enrolled in the public option. The vast majority of the American people would still not be in that option. Number one.

Trump,"Obamacare is no good. We made it better and I had a choice to make very early on. We took away the individual mandate. We guaranteed pre-existing conditions, but took away the individual mandate. Listen, this is the way it is. And that destroyed  They shouldnt even call it Obamacare, then I had a choice to make, do I let my people run it really well or badly? If I run it badly, theyll probably blame him, but theyll blame me. But more importantly, I want to help people. Okay. I said, Youve got to run it so well. And I just had a meeting with them. They said the problem is, no matter how well you run Obamacare, its a disaster. Its too expensive. Premiums are too high, that it doesnt work. So we do want to get rid of it.

Biden,Sure.,2020-09-29,Democrat
Wallace,"Mr. Vice President, if Senate Republicans, we were talking originally about the Supreme Court here, if Senate Republicans go ahead and confirm Justice Barrett there has been talk about ending the filibuster or even packing the court, adding to the nine justices there. You call this a distraction by the President. But, in fact, it wasnt brought up by the President. It was brought up by some of your Democratic colleagues in the Congress. So my question to you is, you have refused in the past to talk about it, are you willing to tell the American people tonight whether or not you will support either ending the filibuster or packing the court?",2020-09-29,Moderator
Biden,"Whatever position I take on that, thatll become the issue. The issue is the American people should speak. You should go out and vote. Youre voting now. Vote and let your Senators know how strongly you feel.",2020-09-29,Democrat

Trump,"The people understand, Joe.",2020-09-29,Republican
Biden,They sure do.,2020-09-29,Democrat
Trump,"47 years, youve done nothing. They understand.",2020-09-29,Republican
Wallace,"All right, the second subject is COVID-19, which is an awfully serious subject. So lets try to be serious about it. We have had more than seven million cases of coronavirus in the United States and more than 200,000 people have died. Even after we produce a vaccine, experts say that it could be months or even years before we come back to anything approaching normal. My question for both of you is, based on what you have said and done so far, and what you have said you would do starting in 2021, why should the American people trust you more than your opponent to deal with this public health crisis going forward? In this case, the question goes to you first, sir. Two minutes, uninterrupted.",2020-09-29,Moderator
Biden,"Good luck. 200,000 dead. As you said, over seven million infected in the United States. We, in fact, have 4% of the worlds population, 20% of the deaths. 40,000 people a day are contracting COVID. In addition to that, about between 750 and 1000 people a day are dying. When he was presented with that number, he said, It is what it is. Well, it is what it is because you are who you are. Thats why it is. The President has no plan. He hasnt laid out anything. He knew all the way back in February how serious this crisis was. He knew it was a deadly disease. What did he do? Hes on tape as acknowledging he knew it. He said he didnt tell us or give people a warning of it because he didnt want to panic the American people. You dont panic. He panicked. In addition to that, what did he do?",2020-09-29,Democrat
Biden,He went in and we were insisting that the people we had in the ground in China should be able to go to Wuhan and determine for themselves how dangerous this was. He did not even ask Xi to do that.,2020-09-29,Democrat
Trump,Wrong.,2020-09-29,Republican
Biden,He told us what a great job Xi was doing. He said we owe him a debt of gratitude for being so transparent with us. And what did he do then? He then did nothing. He waited and waited and waited. He still doesnt have a plan.,2020-09-29,Democrat
Trump,Wrong.,2020-09-29,Republican
Wallace,"Sir, its his two minutes.",2020-09-29,Moderator
Trump,Its so wrong.,2020-09-29,Republican
Biden,"I laid out back in March, exactly what we should be doing. And I laid out again in July, what we should be doing. We should be providing all the protective gear possible. We should be providing the money the House has passed in order to be able to go out and get people the help they need to keep their businesses open. Open schools cost a lot of money. You should get out of your bunker and get out of the sand trap in your golf course and go in the Oval Office and bring together the Democrats and Republicans and fund what needs to be done now to save lives.",2020-09-29,Democrat
Trump,"So, if we would have listened to you.",2020-09-29,Republican
Wallace,"Wait, wait. You have two minutes, sir.",2020-09-29,Moderator
Trump,"If we wouldve listened to you, the country would have been left wide open, millions of people would have died, not 200,000. And one person is too much. Its Chinas fault. It should have never happened. They stopped it from going in, but it was Chinas fault. And, by the way, when you talk about numbers, you dont know how many people died in China. You dont know how many people died in Russia. You dont know how many people died in India. They dont exactly give you a straight count, just so you understand. But if you look at what weve done, I closed it and you said, Hes xenophobic. Hes a racist and hes xenophobic, because you didnt think I should have closed our country. Wait a minute.",2020-09-29,Republican
Wallace,"Sir, its his two minutes.",2020-09-29,Moderator
Trump,"You didnt think we should have closed our country because you thought it was terrible. You wouldnt have closed it for another two months. By my doing it early, in fact, Dr. Fauci said, President Trump saved thousands of lives. Many of your Democrat Governors said, President Trump did a phenomenal job. We worked with the Governor. Oh really, go take a look. The Governors said I did a phenomenal job. Most of them said that. In fact, people that would not be necessarily on my side said that, President Trump did a phenomenal job. We did. We got the gowns. We got the masks. We made the ventilators. You wouldnt have made ventilators. And now were weeks away from a vaccine. Were doing therapeutics already. Fewer people are dying when they get sick. Far fewer people are dying. Weve done a great job.",2020-09-29,Republican
Trump,"The only thing I havent done a good job, and thats because of the fake news, no matter what you say to them, they give you a bad press on it. Its just fake news. They give you good press, they give me bad press because thats the way it is, unfortunately. But let me just say something. I dont care. Ive gotten used to it. But Ill tell you, Joe, you could never have done the job that we did. You dont have it in your blood. You couldve never done that, Joe.",2020-09-29,Republican
Biden,I know how to do the job. I know how to get the job done.,2020-09-29,Democrat
Trump,"Well, you didnt do very well in Swine Flu. H1-N1, you were a disaster. Your own Chief of Staff said you were a disaster.",2020-09-29,Republican
Biden,"14,000 people died, not 200,000.",2020-09-29,Democrat
Trump,"A far less lethal disease, by the way.",2020-09-29,Republican
Wallace,"Sir, you made a point. Let him answer it.",2020-09-29,Moderator
Biden,"And there was no one  We didnt shut down the economy. This is his economy he shut down. The reason its shut down is because, look, you folks at home. How many of you got up this morning and had an empty chair at the kitchen table because someone died of COVID? How many of you are in a situation where you lost your mom or dad and you couldnt even speak to them, you had a nurse holding a phone up so you could in fact say goodbye?",2020-09-29,Democrat
Trump,"We would have lost far more people, far more people. You would have been months late. Youre months behind me, Joe.",2020-09-29,Republican
Biden,"His own CDC Director says we could lose as many as another 200,000 people between now and the end of the year. And he said, if we just wear a mask, we can save half those numbers. Just a mask. And by the way, in terms of the whole notion of a vaccine, were for a vaccine, but I dont trust him at all. Nor do you. I know you dont. What we trust is a scientist.",2020-09-29,Democrat
Trump,"You dont trust Johnson & Johnson, Pfizer?",2020-09-29,Republican
Wallace,"Okay, gentlemen, gentlemen. Let me move on to questions about the future because you both have touched on two of the questions Im going to ask. Focusing on the future first, President Trump, you have repeatedly either contradicted or been at odds with some of your governments own top scientists. The week before last, the Head of the Centers for Disease Control, Dr. Redfield said it would be summer before the vaccine would become generally available to the public. You said that he was confused and mistaken. Those were your two words. But Dr. Slaoui, the head of your Operation Warp Speed, has said exactly the same thing. Are they both wrong?",2020-09-29,Moderator
Trump,"Well, Ive spoken to the companies and we can have it a lot sooner. Its a very political thing because people like this would rather make it political than save lives.",2020-09-29,Republican
Biden,God.,2020-09-29,Democrat
Trump,"It is a very political thing. Ive spoken to Pfizer, Ive spoken to all of the people that you have to speak to, Moderna, Johnson & Johnson, and others. They can go faster than that by a lot. Its become very political because the left Or I dont know if I call them left, I dont know what I call them.",2020-09-29,Republican
Wallace,"So youre suggesting that the head of your Operation Warp Speed, Dr. Slaoui-",2020-09-29,Moderator
Trump,"I disagree with him. No, I disagree with both of them. And he didnt say that. He said it could be there, but it could also be much sooner. I had him in my office two days ago.",2020-09-29,Republican
Wallace,"He talked about the summer, sir, before its generally available, just like Dr. Redfield.",2020-09-29,Moderator
Trump,Because he said its a possibility that well have the answer before November 1st. It could also be after that.,2020-09-29,Republican
Wallace,"Im talking about when its generally available, not-",2020-09-29,Moderator
Trump,"Well, were going to deliver it right away. We have the military all set up. Logistically, theyre all set up. We have our military that delivers soldiers and they can do 200,000 a day. Theyre going to be delivering-",2020-09-29,Republican
Biden,This is the same man who told you-,2020-09-29,Democrat
Trump,Its all set up.,2020-09-29,Republican
Biden,"by Easter, this would be gone away. By the warm weather, itd be gone. Miraculous, like a miracle. And by the way, maybe you could inject some bleach in your arm, and that would take care of it. This is the same man.",2020-09-29,Democrat
Trump,"That was said sarcastically, and you know that. That was said sarcastically.",2020-09-29,Republican
Biden,"So heres the deal. This man is talking about a vaccine. Every serious company is talking about maybe having a vaccine done by the end of the year, but the distribution of that vaccine will not occur until sometime beginning of the middle of next year to get it out, if we get the vaccine. And pray God we will. Pray God we will.",2020-09-29,Democrat
Wallace,"Mr. Vice President, I want to pick up-",2020-09-29,Moderator
Trump,Youll have the vaccine sooner than that.,2020-09-29,Republican
Wallace,"I want to pick up on this question though. You say the public can trust the scientists, but they cant trust President Trump. In fact, you said that again tonight. Your running mate, Senator Harris, goes further, saying that public health experts quote, Will be muzzled, will be suppressed. Given the fact that polls already show that people are concerned about the vaccine and are reluctant to take it, are you and your running mate, Senator Harris, contributing to that fear?",2020-09-29,Moderator
Biden,No more than the question you just asked him. You pointed out he puts pressure and disagrees with his own scientists.,2020-09-29,Democrat
Wallace,But youre saying you cant-,2020-09-29,Moderator
Biden,Everybody knows-,2020-09-29,Democrat

Trump,We spoke to the scientists that are in charge-,2020-09-29,Republican
Biden,By the way-,2020-09-29,Democrat
Trump,they will have the vaccine very soon.,2020-09-29,Republican
Wallace,Let him finish.,2020-09-29,Moderator
Biden,"Do you believe for a moment what hes telling you in light of all the lies hes told you about the whole issue relating to COVID?

Biden,"Its about equity and equality. Its about decency. Its about the Constitution. And we have never walked away from trying to require, acquire equity for everyone, equality for the whole of America.

Close your eyes, remember what those people look like coming out of the fields, carrying torches, their veins bulging, spewingjust spewing anti-Semitic bile and accompanied by the Ku Klux Klan.

Biden,Now-,2020-09-29,Democrat
Wallace,two minutes sir.,2020-09-29,Moderator
Biden,"second point Id make to you, is that when Floyd was killed, when Mr. Floyd was killed, there was a peaceful protest in front of the White House. What did he do? He came out of his bunker, had the military use tear gas on them so he could walk across to a church and hold up a Bible. And then what happened after that? The Bishop of that very church said that it was a disgrace. The general who was with him said All he ever wants to do is divide people, not unite people at all. This is a president who has used everything as a dog whistle, to try to generate racist hatred, racist division. This is a man who, in fact, you talk about helping African-Americans, one in 1000 African Americans has been killed because of the coronavirus. And if he doesnt do something quickly, by the end of the year, one in 500 will have been killed. One in 500 African Americans. This man, this man is a savior of African-Americans? This man cares at all? This mans done virtually nothing. Look, the fact is that you have to look at what hes talks about. You have to look at what he did. And what he did has been disastrous for the African-American community.",2020-09-29,Democrat
Trump,So-,2020-09-29,Republican
Wallace,"President Trump, you have two minutes. Why should Americans trust you over your opponent to deal with race issues?",2020-09-29,Moderator
Trump,"You did a crime bill, 1994, where you called them super-predators. African-Americans are super-predators and theyve never forgotten it. Theyve never forgotten it.",2020-09-29,Republican
Biden,Ive never said-,2020-09-29,Democrat
Wallace,"No, no, sir. Its his two minutes.",2020-09-29,Moderator
Trump,"So you did that, and they call you super-predator and Im letting people out of jail now, that you have treated the African-American population community, you have treated the black community about as bad as anybody in this country. You did the 1990and thats why, if you look at the polls, Im doing better than any Republican has done in a long time, because they saw what you did. You call them super-predators, and youve called them worse than that. Because you look back at your testimony over the years, youve called them a lot worse than that. As far as the church is concerned, and as far as the generals are concerned, we just got the support of 200250 military leaders and generals, total support. Law enforcement, almost every law enforcement group in the United States. I have Florida. I have Texas. I have Ohio. I have every Excuse me, Portland, the sheriff just came out today and he said, I support President Trump. I dont think you have any law enforcement. You cant even say the word law enforcement. Because if you say those words, youre going to lose all of your radical left supporters. And why arent you saying those words, Joe? Why dont you say the words law enforcement? Because you know what? If they called us in Portland, we would put out that fire in a half an hour. But they wont do it, because theyre run by radical left Democrats. If you look at Chicago, if you look at any place you want to look, Seattle, they heard we were coming in the following day and they put up their hands and we got back Seattle. Minneapolis, we got it back, Joe, because we believe in law and order, but you dont. The top 10 cities and just about the top 40 cities are run by Democrats, and in many cases radical left. And theyve got you wrapped around their finger, Joe, to a point where you dont want to say anything about law and order. And Ill tell you what, the people of this country want and demand law and order and youre afraid to even say it.",2020-09-29,Republican
Wallace,"All right. I want to return to the question of race. Vice President Biden, after the grand jury in the Breonna Taylor case decided not to charge any of the police with homicide, you said it raises the question, Whether justice could be equally applied in America. Do you believe that there is a separate but unequal system of justice for Blacks in this country?",2020-09-29,Moderator
Biden,"Yes, there is. Theres systemic injustice in this country, in education and work and in law enforcement and the way in which its enforced. But look, the vast majority of police officers are good, decent, honorable men and women. They risk their lives every day to take care of us. But there are some bad apples. And when they occur, when they find them, they have to be sorted out. They have to be held accountable. They have to be held accountable. And what Im going to do as President of the United States is call a, a, together an entire group of people at the White House, everything from the civil rights groups, to the police officers, to the police chiefs, and were going to work this out. Were going to work this out. So we change the way in which we have more transparency, in when these things happen. These cops arent happy to see what happened to George Floyd. These cops arent happy to see what happened to Breonna Taylor. Most dont like it, but we have to have a system where people are held accountable whenand by the way, violence in response is never appropriate, never appropriate. Peaceful protest is, violence is never appropriate.",2020-09-29,Democrat

Wallace,"This month, your Administration, uh, directed federal agencies to end racial sensitivity training that addresses white privilege or critical race theory. Why did you decide to do that, to end racial sensitivity training? And do you believe that there is systemic racism in this country, sir?",2020-09-29,Moderator
Trump,"I ended it because its racist. I ended it because a lot of people were complaining that they were asked to do things that were absolutely insane. That it was a radical revolution that was taking place in our military, in our schools, all over the place. And you know it, and so does everybody else. And he would know it, oh its totally racial.

Many people dont want to hurt other peoples feelings. But its amazing, it makes a big difference. It makes a gigantic difference in the way a child is able to grow up and have a self-sense, a sense of self-esteem. Its a little bit like how this guy and, and his friends look down on so many people. They look down their nose on people like Irish Catholics, like me, and grew up in Scranton. They look down on people who dont have money. They look down on people who are of a different faith. They look down on people who are a different color. In fact, were all Americans.

They need when they show up for a 9-11 call to have someone with them as a psychologist or psychiatrist to keep them from having to use force and be able to talk people down.

When the president seeks a second term, it is generally a referendum on his record but Vice-President Biden, you like to quote one of your dads sayings, which is dont compare me to the almighty, compare me to the alternative. And in this case sir you are the alternative. Looking at both of your records, Im going to ask each of you. Why should voters elect you president over your opponent? In this segment, President Trump youll go first, two minutes.",2020-09-29,Moderator
Trump,"Because there has never been an administration or president who has done more than Ive done in a period of three and a half years. And thats despite the impeachment hoax and you saw what happened today with Hillary Clinton, where it was a whole big con job. But despite going through all of these things where I had to fight, both flanks and behind me and above, there has never been an administration thats done what Ive done. The greatest, before COVID came in, the greatest economy in history, lowest employunemployment numbers, everything was good. Everything was going. And by the way, there was unity going to happen. People were calling me for the first time in years, they were calling, and they were saying its time maybe and then what happened? We got hit. But now were building it back up again. A rebuilding of the military, including Space Force and all of the other things. A fixing of the VA which was a mess under him. Three hundred and eight thousand people died because they didnt have proper health care. It was a mess. And we now got a 91% approval rating at the VA, our vets. We take care of our vets. But weve rebuilt our military. The job that weve done. . . and, and Ill tell you something, some people say maybe the most important. By the end of the first term, Ill have approximately 300 Federal judges and Court of Appeals judges, 300, and hopefully three great Supreme Court judges, justices. That is a record the likes of which very few people. . . and you know, one of the reasons Ill have so many judges? Because President Obama and him left me 128 judges to fill. When you leave office, you dont leave any judges. Thats like, you just dont do that. They left 128 openings, and if I were a member of his party, because they have a little different philosophy, Id say, if you left us 128 openings you cant be a good president. You cant be a good Vice President but I want to thank you because it gives us almost, itll probably be above that number. By the end of this term, 300 judges. Its a record.",2020-09-29,Republican
Wallace,"Looking at both of your records. Why should voters elect you President as opposed to President Trump, you have two minutes uninterrupted.",2020-09-29,Moderator
Biden,"Under this President, we become weaker, sicker, poorer, more divided and more violent. When I was Vice President, we inherited a recession. I was asked to fix it. I did. We left him a booming economy, and he caused the recession. With regard to being weaker, the fact is that Ive gone head to head with Putin and made it clear to him were not going to take any of his stuff. Hes Putins puppy.

Its on his watch. And with regard to more divided, the nation, it cant stay divided. We cant be this way. And speaking of my son, the way you talk about the military, the way you talk about them being losers and being, and, and, and just being suckers. My son was in Iraq. He spent a year there.

Wallace,"Okay. The forest fires in the West are raging now. They have burned millions of acres. They have displaced hundreds of thousands of people. When state officials there blamed the fires on climate change, Mr. President, you said, I dont think the science knows. Over your four years, you have pulled the US out of the Paris Climate Accord. You have rolled back a number of Obama Environmental records, what do you believe about the science of climate change, and what will you do in the next four years to confront it?",2020-09-29,Moderator
Trump,"I want crystal clean water and air. I want beautiful clean air. We have now the lowest carbon. If you look at our numbers right now, we are doing phenomenally. But I havent destroyed our businesses. Our businesses arent put out of commission. If you look at the Paris Accord, it was a disaster from our standpoint. And people are actually very happy about whats going on, because our businesses are doing well. As far as the fires are concerned, you need forest management. In addition to everything else, the forest floors are loaded up with trees, dead trees that are years old and theyre like tinder and leaves and everything else. You drop a cigarette in there the whole forest burns down. Youve got to have forest management.",2020-09-29,Republican
Wallace,"What do you believe about the science of climate change, sir?",2020-09-29,Moderator

Californias burning, Californias burning. If that was cleaned, if that were, if you had forest management, good forest management, you wouldnt be getting those calls. You know, in Europe, they live their forest cities. They call forest cities. They maintain their forest. They manage their forest. I was with the head of a major country, its a forest city. He said, Sir, we have trees that are far more, they ignite much easier than California. There shouldnt be that problem. I spoke with the Governor about it. Im getting along very well with the governor. But I said, At some point you cant every year have hundreds of thousands of acres of land just burned to the ground.",2020-09-29,Republican
Wallace,But sir. . .,2020-09-29,Moderator
Trump,Thats burning down because of a lack of management.,2020-09-29,Republican
Wallace,"But sir, if you believe in the science of climate change, why have you rolled back the Obama Clean Power Plan which limited carbon emissions in power plants? Why have you relaxed?",2020-09-29,Moderator
Trump,Because it was driving energy prices through the sky.,2020-09-29,Republican
Wallace,Why have you relaxed fuel economy standards that are going to create more pollution from cars and trucks?,2020-09-29,Moderator
Trump,"Well, not really because whats happening is the car is much less expensive, and its a much safer car, and youre talking about a tiny difference. And then what would happen because of the cost of the car you would have at least double and triple the number of cars purchased. We have the old slugs out there that are 10, 12 years old. If you did that, the car would be safer. It would be much cheaper by $3,500.",2020-09-29,Republican
Wallace,But in the case of California they have simply ignored your rollback.,2020-09-29,Moderator
Trump,"No, but you would take a lot of cars off the market because people would be able to afford a car. Now, so, and by the way, were going to see how that turns out. But a lot of people agree with me, many people. The car has gotten so expensive because they have computers all over the place for an extra little bit of gasoline.",2020-09-29,Republican
Wallace,OK. . .,2020-09-29,Moderator
Trump,And Im okay with electric cars too. I think Im all for electric cars. Ive given big incentives for electric cars but what theyve done in California is just crazy.,2020-09-29,Republican
Wallace,"All right, Vice President Biden. Id like you to respond to the presidents climate change record, but I also want to ask you about a concern. You propose $2 trillion in green jobs. You talk about new limits, not abolishing, but new limits on fracking. Ending the use of fossil fuels to generate electricity by 2035, and zero net emission of greenhouse gases by 2050. The president says a lot of these things would tank the economy and cost millions of jobs.",2020-09-29,Moderator
Biden,"Hes absolutely wrong, number one. Number two, if in fact, when, during our Administration in the Recovery Act, I was able, was in charge, able to bring down the cost of renewable energy to cheaper than or as cheap as coal and gas and oil. Nobodys gonna build another, uh, coal fired plant in America. No ones going to build another oil fire plant in America. Theyre going to move to renewable energy, number one, Number two, were going to make sure that we are able to take the federal fleet and turn it into a fleet thats run on, thatre electric vehicles. Making sure that we can do that, were going to put 500,000 charging stations and all of the highways that were going to be building in the future. Were going to build a economy that in fact is going to provide for the ability us to take 4 million buildings and make sure that they in fact are weatherized in a way that in fact will theyll emit significantly less gas and oil because the heat will not be going out. Theres so many things that we can do now to create thousands and thousands of jobs. We can get to net zero, in terms of energy production, by 2035. Not only not costing people jobs, creating jobs. Creating millions of good-paying jobs. Not 15 bucks an hour, but prevailing wage, by having a new infrastructure that in fact, is green. And the first thing I will do, I will rejoin the Paris Accord. I will join the Paris Accord because with us out of it, look whats happening. Its all falling apart. And talk about someone who has no, no relationship to, with foreign policy. Brazil, the rainforests of Brazil are being torn down, are being ripped down. More, more carbon is absorbed in that rainforest than every bit of carbon thats emitted in the United States. Instead of doing something about that, I would be gathering up and making sure we had the compcountries of the world coming up with 20 billion dollars, and say, Heres $20 billion. Stop, stop tearing, tearing down the forest. And if you dont, then youre going to have significant economic consequences.",2020-09-29,Democrat

They came after me spying on my campaign. They started from the day I won, and even before I won. From the day I came down the escalator with our first lady, they were a disaster. They were a disgrace to our country, and weve caught em. Weve caught em all. Weve got it all on tape. Weve caught em all. And by the way, you gave the idea for the Logan Act against General Flynn. You better take a look at that, because we caught you in a sense, and President Obama was sitting in the office. He knew about it too. So dont tell me about a free transition. As far as the ballots are concerned, its a disaster. A solicited ballot, okay, solicited, is okay. Youre soliciting. Youre asking. They send it back. You send it back. I did that. If you have an unsolicitedtheyre sending millions of ballots all over the country. Theres fraud. They found em in creeks. They found some, with the name Trump, just happened to have the name Trump, just the other day in a wastepaper basket. Theyre being sent all over the place. They sent two in a Democrat area. They sent out a thousand ballots. Everybody got two ballots. This is going to be a fraud like youve never seen. The other thing, its nice. On November 3rd, youre watching, and you see who won the election. And I think were going to do well because people are really happy with the job weve done. But you know what? We wont know. We might not know for months because these ballots are going to be all over. Take a look at what happened in Manhattan. Take a look at what happened in New Jersey. Take a look at what happened in Virginia and other places. Theyre not losing 2%, 1%, which by the way is too much. An election could be won or lost with that. Theyre losing 30 and 40%. Its a fraud, and its a shame. And can you imagine where they say, uh, You have to have your ballot in by November 10th. November 10th. That means, thats seven days after the election, in theory, shouldve been announced.",2020-09-29,Republican

The participants tonight are Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. This debate is sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates, a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization. The commission drafted tonights format, and the rules have been agreed to by the campaigns. The 90-minute debate is divided into six segments, each 15 minutes long. Well explore three topic areas tonight: Achieving prosperity; Americas direction; and securing America. At the start of each segment, I will ask the same lead-off question to both candidates, and they will each have up to two minutes to respond. From that point until the end of the segment, well have an open discussion. The questions are mine and have not been shared with the commission or the campaigns. The audience here in the room has agreed to remain silent so that we can focus on what the candidates are saying.",2016-09-26,Moderator
Clinton,"How are you, Donald? [applause]",2016-09-26,Democrat
Holt,"Good luck to you. [applause] Well, I dont expect us to cover all the issues of this campaign tonight, but I remind everyone, there are two more presidential debates scheduled. We are going to focus on many of the issues that voters tell us are most important, and were going to press for specifics. I am honored to have this role, but this evening belongs to the candidates and, just as important, to the American people. Candidates, we look forward to hearing you articulate your policies and your positions, as well as your visions and your values. So, lets begin. Were calling this opening segment Achieving Prosperity. And central to that is jobs. There are two economic realities in America today. Theres been a record six straight years of job growth, and new census numbers show incomes have increased at a record rate after years of stagnation. However, income inequality remains significant, and nearly half of Americans are living paycheck to paycheck.",2016-09-26,Moderator
Clinton,"Well, thank you, Lester, and thanks to Hofstra for hosting us. The central question in this election is really what kind of country we want to be and what kind of future well build together. Today is my granddaughters second birthday, so I think about this a lot. First, we have to build an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top. That means we need new jobs, good jobs, with rising incomes. I want us to invest in you. I want us to invest in your future. That means jobs in infrastructure, in advanced manufacturing, innovation and technology, clean, renewable energy, and small business, because most of the new jobs will come from small business. We also have to make the economy fairer. That starts with raising the national minimum wage and also guarantee, finally, equal pay for womens work. I also want to see more companies do profit-sharing. If you help create the profits, you should be able to share in them, not just the executives at the top. And I want us to do more to support people who are struggling to balance family and work. Ive heard from so many of you about the difficult choices you face and the stresses that youre under. So lets have paid family leave, earned sick days. Lets be sure we have affordable child care and debt-free college. How are we going to do it? Were going to do it by having the wealthy pay their fair share and close the corporate loopholes. Finally, we tonight are on the stage together, Donald Trump and I. Donald, its good to be with you. Were going to have a debate where we are talking about the important issues facing our country. You have to judge us, who can shoulder the immense, awesome responsibilities of the presidency, who can put into action the plans that will make your life better. I hope that I will be able to earn your vote on November 8th.",2016-09-26,Democrat
Holt,"Secretary Clinton, thank you. Mr. Trump, the same question to you. Its about putting moneymore money into the pockets of American workers. You have up to two minutes.",2016-09-26,Moderator
Trump,"Thank you, Lester. Our jobs are fleeing the country. Theyre going to Mexico. Theyre going to many other countries. You look at what China is doing to our country in terms of making our product. Theyre devaluing their currency, and theres nobody in our government to fight them. And we have a very good fight. And we have a winning fight. Because theyre using our country as a piggy bank to rebuild China, and many other countries are doing the same thing. So were losing our good jobs, so many of them. When you look at whats happening in Mexico, a friend of mine who builds plants said its the eighth wonder of the world. Theyre building some of the biggest plants anywhere in the world, some of the most sophisticated, some of the best plants. With the United States, as he said, not so much. So Ford is leaving. You see that, their small car division leaving. Thousands of jobs leaving Michigan, leaving Ohio. Theyre all leaving. And we cant allow it to happen anymore. As far as child care is concerned and so many other things, I think Hillary and I agree on that. We probably disagree a little bit as to numbers and amounts and what were going to do, but perhaps well be talking about that later. But we have to stop our jobs from being stolen from us. We have to stop our companies from leaving the United States and, with it, firing all of their people. All you have to do is take a look at Carrier air conditioning in Indianapolis. They leftfired 1,400 people. Theyre going to Mexico. So many hundreds and hundreds of companies are doing this. We cannot let it happen. Under my plan, Ill be reducing taxes tremendously, from 35 percent to 15 percent for companies, small and big businesses. Thats going to be a job creator like we havent seen since Ronald Reagan. Its going to be a beautiful thing to watch. Companies will come. They will build. They will expand. New companies will start. And I look very, very much forward to doing it. We have to renegotiate our trade deals, and we have to stop these countries from stealing our companies and our jobs.",2016-09-26,Republican
Holt,"Secretary Clinton, would you like to respond?",2016-09-26,Moderator
Clinton,"Well, I think that trade is an important issue. Of course, we are 5 percent of the worlds population; we have to trade with the other 95 percent. And we need to have smart, fair trade deals. We also, though, need to have a tax system that rewards work and not just financial transactions. And the kind of plan that Donald has put forth would be trickle-down economics all over again. In fact, it would be the most extreme version, the biggest tax cuts for the top percent of the people in this country than weve ever had. I call it trumped-up trickle-down, because thats exactly what it would be. That is not how we grow the economy. We just have a different view about whats best for growing the economy, how we make investments that will actually produce jobs and rising incomes. I think we come at it from somewhat different perspectives. I understand that. You know, Donald was very fortunate in his life, and thats all to his benefit. He started his business with $14 million, borrowed from his father, and he really believes that the more you help wealthy people, the better off well be and that everything will work out from there. I dont buy that. I have a different experience. My father was a small-businessman. He worked really hard. He printed drapery fabrics on long tables, where he pulled out those fabrics and he went down with a silkscreen and dumped the paint in and took the squeegee and kept going. And so what I believe is the more we can do for the middle class, the more we can invest in you, your education, your skills, your future, the better we will be off and the better well grow. Thats the kind of economy I want us to see again.",2016-09-26,Democrat
Holt,"Let me follow up with Mr. Trump, if I can. Youve talked about creating 25 million jobs, and youve promised to bring back millions of jobs for Americans. How are you going to bring back the industries that have left this country for cheaper labor overseas? How, specifically, are you going to tell American manufacturers that you have to come back?",2016-09-26,Moderator
Trump,"Well, for one thingand before we start on thatmy father gave me a very small loan in 1975, and I built it into a company thats worth many, many billions of dollars, with some of the greatest assets in the world, and I say that only because thats the kind of thinking that our country needs. Our countrys in deep trouble. We dont know what were doing when it comes to devaluations and all of these countries all over the world, especially China. Theyre the best, the best ever at it. What theyre doing to us is a very, very sad thing. So we have to do that. We have to renegotiate our trade deals. And, Lester, theyre taking our jobs, theyre giving incentives, theyre doing things that, frankly, we dont do. Let me give you the example of Mexico. They have a VAT tax. Were on a different system. When we sell into Mexico, theres a tax. When they sell inautomatic, 16 percent, approximately. When they sell into us, theres no tax. Its a defective agreement. Its been defective for a long time, many years, but the politicians havent done anything about it. Now, in all fairness to Secretary Clintonyes, is that OK? Good. I want you to be very happy. Its very important to me.",2016-09-26,Republican
Holt,"Let me interrupt just a moment, but",2016-09-26,Moderator
Trump,"Secretary Clinton and others, politicians, should have been doing this for years, not right now, because of the fact that weve created a movement. They should have been doing this for years. Whats happened to our jobs and our country and our economy generally islook, we owe $20 trillion. We cannot do it any longer, Lester.",2016-09-26,Republican
Holt,"Back to the question, though. How do you bring backspecifically bring back jobs, American manufacturers? How do you make them bring the jobs back?",2016-09-26,Moderator
Trump,"Well, the first thing you do is dont let the jobs leave. The companies are leaving. I could name, I mean, there are thousands of them. Theyre leaving, and theyre leaving in bigger numbers than ever. And what you do is you say, fine, you want to go to Mexico or some other country, good luck. We wish you a lot of luck. But if you think youre going to make your air conditioners or your cars or your cookies or whatever you make and bring them into our country without a tax, youre wrong. And once you say youre going to have to tax them coming in, and our politicians never do this, because they have special interests and the special interests want those companies to leave, because in many cases, they own the companies. So what Im saying is, we can stop them from leaving. We have to stop them from leaving. And thats a big, big factor.",2016-09-26,Republican
Holt,Let me let Secretary Clinton get in here.,2016-09-26,Moderator
Clinton,"Well, lets stop for a second and remember where we were eight years ago. We had the worst financial crisis, the Great Recession, the worst since the 1930s. That was in large part because of tax policies that slashed taxes on the wealthy, failed to invest in the middle class, took their eyes off of Wall Street, and created a perfect storm. In fact, Donald was one of the people who rooted for the housing crisis. He said, back in 2006, Gee, I hope it does collapse, because then I can go in and buy some and make some money. Well, it did collapse.",2016-09-26,Democrat
Trump,"Thats called business, by the way.",2016-09-26,Republican
Clinton,"Nine million peoplenine million people lost their jobs. Five million people lost their homes. And $13 trillion in family wealth was wiped out. Now, we have come back from that abyss. And it has not been easy. So were now on the precipice of having a potentially much better economy, but the last thing we need to do is to go back to the policies that failed us in the first place. Independent experts have looked at what Ive proposed and looked at what Donalds proposed, and basically theyve said this, that if his tax plan, which would blow up the debt by over $5 trillion and would in some instances disadvantage middle-class families compared to the wealthy, were to go into effect, we would lose 3.5 million jobs and maybe have another recession. Theyve looked at my plans and theyve said, OK, if we can do this, and I intend to get it done, we will have 10 million more new jobs, because we will be making investments where we can grow the economy. Take clean energy. Some country is going to be the clean- energy superpower of the 21st century. Donald thinks that climate change is a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese. I think its real.",2016-09-26,Democrat

Clinton,I think science is real.,2016-09-26,Democrat
Trump,I do not say that.,2016-09-26,Republican
Clinton,"And I think its important that we grip this and deal with it, both at home and abroad. And heres what we can do. We can deploy a half a billion more solar panels. We can have enough clean energy to power every home. We can build a new modern electric grid. Thats a lot of jobs; thats a lot of new economic activity. So Ive tried to be very specific about what we can and should do, and I am determined that were going to get the economy really moving again, building on the progress weve made over the last eight years, but never going back to what got us in trouble in the first place.",2016-09-26,Democrat
Holt,Mr. Trump?,2016-09-26,Moderator
Trump,"She talks about solar panels. We invested in a solar company, our country. That was a disaster. They lost plenty of money on that one. Now, look, Im a great believer in all forms of energy, but were putting a lot of people out of work. Our energy policies are a disaster. Our country is losing so much in terms of energy, in terms of paying off our debt. You cant do what youre looking to do with $20 trillion in debt. The Obama administration, from the time theyve come in, is over 230 years worth of debt, and hes topped it. Hes doubled it in a course of almost eight years, seven-and-a-half years, to be semi- exact. So I will tell you this. We have to do a much better job at keeping our jobs. And we have to do a much better job at giving companies incentives to build new companies or to expand, because theyre not doing it. And all you have to do is look at Michigan and look at Ohio and look at all of these places where so many of their jobs and their companies are just leaving, theyre gone. And, Hillary, Id just ask you this. Youve been doing this for 30 years. Why are you just thinking about these solutions right now? For 30 years, youve been doing it, and now youre just starting to think of solutions.",2016-09-26,Republican

When I was in the Senate, I had a number of trade deals that came before me, and I held them all to the same test. Will they create jobs in America? Will they raise incomes in America? And are they good for our national security? Some of them I voted for. The biggest one, a multinational one known as CAFTA, I voted against. And because I hold the same standards as I look at all of these trade deals. But lets not assume that trade is the only challenge we have in the economy. I think it is a part of it, and Ive said what Im going to do. Im going to have a special prosecutor. Were going to enforce the trade deals we have, and were going to hold people accountable. When I was secretary of state, we actually increased American exports globally 30 percent. We increased them to China 50 percent.

Trump,"Well, Im really calling for major jobs, because the wealthy are going to create tremendous jobs. Theyre going to expand their companies. Theyre going to do a tremendous job. Im getting rid of the carried interest provision. And if you really look, its not a taxits really not a great thing for the wealthy. Its a great thing for the middle class. Its a great thing for companies to expand. And when these people are going to put billions and billions of dollars into companies, and when theyre going to bring $2.5 trillion back from overseas, where they cant bring the money back, because politicians like Secretary Clinton wont allow them to bring the money back, because the taxes are so onerous, and the bureaucratic red tape, so whatis so bad. So what theyre doing is theyre leaving our country, and theyre, believe it or not, leaving because taxes are too high and because some of them have lots of money outside of our country. And instead of bringing it back and putting the money to work, because they cant work out a deal toand everybody agrees it should be brought back. Instead of that, theyre leaving our country to get their money, because they cant bring their money back into our country, because of bureaucratic red tape, because they cant get together. Because we havewe have a president that cant sit them around a table and get them to approve something. And heres the thing. Republicans and Democrats agree that this should be done, $2.5 trillion. I happen to think its double that. Its probably $5 trillion that we cant bring into our country, Lester.

Clinton,"Well, I think youve just seen another example of bait-and- switch here. For 40 years, everyone running for president has released their tax returns. You can go and see nearly, I think, 39, 40 years of our tax returns, but everyone has done it. We know the IRS has made clear there is no prohibition on releasing it when youre under audit. So youve got to ask yourself, why wont he release his tax returns? And I think there may be a couple of reasons. First, maybe hes not as rich as he says he is. Second, maybe hes not as charitable as he claims to be. Third, we dont know all of his business dealings, but we have been told through investigative reporting that he owes about $650 million to Wall Street and foreign banks. Or maybe he doesnt want the American people, all of you watching tonight, to know that hes paid nothing in federal taxes, because the only years that anybodys ever seen were a couple of years when he had to turn them over to state authorities when he was trying to get a casino license, and they showed he didnt pay any federal income tax.",2016-09-26,Democrat
Trump,That makes me smart.,2016-09-26,Republican
Clinton,"So if hes paid zero, that means zero for troops, zero for vets, zero for schools or health. And I think probably hes not all that enthusiastic about having the rest of our country see what the real reasons are, because it must be something really important, even terrible, that hes trying to hide. And the financial disclosure statements, they dont give you the tax rate. They dont give you all the details that tax returns would. And it just seems to me that this is something that the American people deserve to see. And I have no reason to believe that hes ever going to release his tax returns, because theres something hes hiding. And well guess. Well keep guessing at what it might be that hes hiding. But I think the question is, were he ever to get near the White House, what would be those conflicts? Who does he owe money to? Well, he owes you the answers to that, and he should provide them.",2016-09-26,Democrat

Holt,Mr. Trump?,2016-09-26,Moderator
Trump,"That was more than a mistake. That was done purposely. OK? That was not a mistake. That was done purposely. When you have your staff taking the Fifth Amendment, taking the Fifth so theyre not prosecuted, when you have the man that set up the illegal server taking the Fifth, I think its disgraceful. And believe me, this country thinks itsreally thinks its disgraceful, also. As far as my tax returns, you dont learn that much from tax returns. That I can tell you. You learn a lot from financial disclosure. And you should go down and take a look at that. The other thing, Im extremely underleveraged. The report that said $650which, by the way, a lot of friends of mine that know my business say, boy, thats really not a lot of money. Its not a lot of money relative to what I had. The buildings that were in question, they said in the same report, which wasactually, it wasnt even a bad story, to be honest with you, but the buildings are worth $3.9 billion. And the $650 isnt even on that. But its not $650. Its much less than that. But I could give you a list of banks, I wouldif that would help you, I would give you a list of banks. These are very fine institutions, very fine banks. I could do that very quickly. I am very underleveraged. I have a great company. I have a tremendous income. And the reason I say that is not in a braggadocios way. Its because its about time that this country had somebody running it that has an idea about money. When we have $20 trillion in debt, and our countrys a mess, you know, its one thing to have $20 trillion in debt and our roads are good and our bridges are good and everythings in great shape, our airports. Our airports are like from a third world country. You land at LaGuardia, you land at Kennedy, you land at LAX, you land at Newark, and you come in from Dubai and Qatar and you see these incredibleyou come in from China, you see these incredible airports, and you landweve become a third world country. So the worst of all things has happened. We owe $20 trillion, and were a mess. We havent even started. And weve spent $6 trillion in the Middle East, according to a report that I just saw. Whether its 6 or 5, but it looks like its 6, $6 trillion in the Middle East, we could have rebuilt our country twice. And its really a shame. And its politicians like Secretary Clinton that have caused this problem. Our country has tremendous problems. Were a debtor nation. Were a serious debtor nation. And we have a country that needs new roads, new tunnels, new bridges, new airports, new schools, new hospitals.

He provided a good middle-class life for us, but the people he worked for, he expected the bargain to be kept on both sides.

Some of the greatest assets anywhere in the world, real estate assets anywhere in the world, beyond the United States, in Europe, lots of different places. Its an unbelievable company. But on occasion, four times, we used certain laws that are there. And when Secretary Clinton talks about people that didnt get paid, first of all, they did get paid a lot, but taken advantage of the laws of the nation. Now, if you want to change the laws, youve been there a long time, change the laws. But I take advantage of the laws of the nation because Im running a company. My obligation right now is to do well for myself, my family, my employees, for my companies. And thats what I do. But what she doesnt say is that tens of thousands of people that are unbelievably happy and that love me. Ill give you an example. Were just opening up on Pennsylvania Avenue right next to the White House, so if I dont get there one way, Im going to get to Pennsylvania Avenue another. But were opening the Old Post Office. Under budget, ahead of schedule, saved tremendous money. Im a year ahead of schedule. And thats what this country should be doing. We build roads and they cost two and three and four times what theyre supposed to cost. We buy products for our military and they come in at costs that are so far above what they were supposed to be, because we dont have people that know what theyre doing. When we look at the budget, the budget is bad to a large extent because we have people that have no idea as to what to do and how to buy. The Trump International is way under budget and way ahead of schedule. And we should be able to do that for our country.",2016-09-26,Republican
Holt,"Well, were well behind schedule, so I want to move to our next segment. We move into our next segment talking about Americas direction. And lets start by talking about race. The share of Americans who say race relations are bad in this country is the highest its been in decades, much of it amplified by shootings of African-Americans by police, as weve seen recently in Charlotte and Tulsa. Race has been a big issue in this campaign, and one of you is going to have to bridge a very wide and bitter gap. So how do you heal the divide? Secretary Clinton, you get two minutes on this.",2016-09-26,Moderator
Clinton,"Well, youre right. Race remains a significant challenge in our country. Unfortunately, race still determines too much, often determines where people live, determines what kind of education in their public schools they can get, and, yes, it determines how theyre treated in the criminal justice system. Weve just seen those two tragic examples in both Tulsa and Charlotte. And weve got to do several things at the same time. We have to restore trust between communities and the police. We have to work to make sure that our police are using the best training, the best techniques, that theyre well prepared to use force only when necessary. Everyone should be respected by the law, and everyone should respect the law. Right now, thats not the case in a lot of our neighborhoods. So I have, ever since the first day of my campaign, called for criminal justice reform. Ive laid out a platform that I think would begin to remedy some of the problems we have in the criminal justice system. But we also have to recognize, in addition to the challenges that we face with policing, there are so many good, brave police officers who equally want reform. So we have to bring communities together in order to begin working on that as a mutual goal. And weve got to get guns out of the hands of people who should not have them. The gun epidemic is the leading cause of death of young African- American men, more than the next nine causes put together. So we have to do two things, as I said. We have to restore trust. We have to work with the police. We have to make sure they respect the communities and the communities respect them. And we have to tackle the plague of gun violence, which is a big contributor to a lot of the problems that were seeing today.",2016-09-26,Democrat
Holt,"All right, Mr. Trump, you have two minutes. How do you heal the divide?",2016-09-26,Moderator
Trump,"Well, first of all, Secretary Clinton doesnt want to use a couple of words, and thats law and order. And we need law and order. If we dont have it, were not going to have a country. And when I look at whats going on in Charlotte, a city I love, a city where I have investments, when I look at whats going on throughout various parts of our country, whether itsI mean, I can just keep naming them all day longwe need law and order in our country. I just got today the, as you know, the endorsement of the Fraternal Order of Police, we justjust came in. We have endorsements from, I think, almost every police group, veryI mean, a large percentage of them in the United States. We have a situation where we have our inner cities, African- Americans, Hispanics are living in hell because its so dangerous. You walk down the street, you get shot. In Chicago, theyve had thousands of shootings, thousands since January 1st. Thousands of shootings. And Im saying, where is this? Is this a war-torn country? What are we doing? And we have to stop the violence. We have to bring back law and order. In a place like Chicago, where thousands of people have been killed, thousands over the last number of years, in fact, almost 4,000 have been killed since Barack Obama became president, overalmost 4,000 people in Chicago have been killed. We have to bring back law and order. Now, whether or not in a place like Chicago you do stop and frisk, which worked very well, Mayor Giuliani is here, worked very well in New York. It brought the crime rate way down. But you take the gun away from criminals that shouldnt be having it. We have gangs roaming the street. And in many cases, theyre illegally here, illegal immigrants. And they have guns. And they shoot people. And we have to be very strong. And we have to be very vigilant. We have to bewe have to know what were doing. Right now, our police, in many cases, are afraid to do anything.

But when you lookand Chicagos not the onlyyou go to Ferguson, you go to so many different places. You need better relationships. I agree with Secretary Clinton on this. You need better relationships between the communities and the police, because in some cases, its not good.

Clinton,"You know, the vibrancy of the black church, the black businesses that employ so many people, the opportunities that so many families are working to provide for their kids. Theres a lot that we should be proud of and we should be supporting and lifting up. But we do always have to make sure we keep people safe. There are the right ways of doing it, and then there are ways that are ineffective. Stop-and-frisk was found to be unconstitutional and, in part, because it was ineffective. It did not do what it needed to do. Now, I believe in community policing. And, in fact, violent crime is one-half of what it was in 1991. Property crime is down 40 percent. We just dont want to see it creep back up. Weve had 25 years of very good cooperation. But there were some problems, some unintended consequences. Too many young African-American and Latino men ended up in jail for nonviolent offenses. And its just a fact that if youre a young African-American man and you do the same thing as a young white man, you are more likely to be arrested, charged, convicted, and incarcerated. So weve got to address the systemic racism in our criminal justice system. We cannot just say law and order. We have to saywe have to come forward with a plan that is going to divert people from the criminal justice system, deal with mandatory minimum sentences, which have put too many people away for too long for doing too little. We need to have more second chance programs. Im glad that were ending private prisons in the federal system; I want to see them ended in the state system. You shouldnt have a profit motivation to fill prison cells with young Americans. So there are some positive ways we can work on this. And I believe strongly that commonsense gun safety measures would assist us. Right nowand this is something Donald has supported, along with the gun lobbyright now, weve got too many military-style weapons on the streets. In a lot of places, our police are outgunned. We need comprehensive background checks, and we need to keep guns out of the hands of those who will do harm. And we finally need to pass a prohibition on anyone whos on the terrorist watch list from being able to buy a gun in our country. If youre too dangerous to fly, you are too dangerous to buy a gun. So there are things we can do, and we ought to do it in a bipartisan way.",2016-09-26,Democrat
Holt,"Secretary Clinton, last week, you said weve got to do everything possible to improve policing, to go right at implicit bias. Do you believe that police are implicitly biased against black people?",2016-09-26,Moderator
Clinton,"Lester, I think implicit bias is a problem for everyone, not just police. I think, unfortunately, too many of us in our great country jump to conclusions about each other. And therefore, I think we need all of us to be asking hard questions about, you know, why am I feeling this way? But when it comes to policing, since it can have literally fatal consequences, I have said, in my first budget, we would put money into that budget to help us deal with implicit bias by retraining a lot of our police officers. Ive met with a group of very distinguished, experienced police chiefs a few weeks ago. They admit its an issue. Theyve got a lot of concerns. Mental health is one of the biggest concerns, because now police are having to handle a lot of really difficult mental health problems on the street. They want support, they want more training, they want more assistance. And I think the federal government could be in a position where we would offer and provide that.",2016-09-26,Democrat

Trump,"First of all, I agree, and a lot of people even within my own party want to give certain rights to people on watch lists and no-fly lists. I agree with you. When a person is on a watch list or a no-fly list, and I have the endorsement of the NRA, which Im very proud of. These are very, very good people, and theyre protecting the Second Amendment. But I think we have to look very strongly at no-fly lists and watch lists. And when people are on there, even if they shouldnt be on there, well help them, well help them legally, well help them get off. But I tend to agree with that quite strongly. I do want to bring up the fact that you were the one that brought up the words super-predator about young black youth. And thats a term that I think was aitsits been horribly met, as you know. I think youve apologized for it. But I think it was a terrible thing to say. And when it comes to stop-and-frisk, you know, youre talking about taking guns away. Well, Im talking about taking guns away from gangs and people that use them. And I dont thinkI really dont think you disagree with me on this, if you want to know the truth. But we went from 2,200 to 500. And it was continued on by Mayor Bloomberg. And it was terminated by current mayor. But stop-and-frisk had a tremendous impact on the safety of New York City.

And if you look at CNN this past week, Patti Solis Doyle was on Wolf Blitzer saying that this happened. Blumenthal sent McClatchy, highly respected reporter at McClatchy, to Kenya to find out about it. They were pressing it very hard. She failed to get the birth certificate.

Clinton,"Well, just listen to what you heard. [laughter] And clearly, as Donald just admitted, he knew he was going to stand on this debate stage, and Lester Holt was going to be asking us questions, so he tried to put the whole racist birther lie to bed. But it cant be dismissed that easily. He has really started his political activity based on this racist lie that our first black president was not an American citizen. There was absolutely no evidence for it, but he persisted, he persisted year after year, because some of his supporters, people that he was trying to bring into his fold, apparently believed it or wanted to believe it. But, remember, Donald started his career back in 1973 being sued by the Justice Department for racial discrimination because he would not rent apartments in one of his developments to African-Americans, and he made sure that the people who worked for him understood that was the policy. He actually was sued twice by the Justice Department. So he has a long record of engaging in racist behavior. And the birther lie was a very hurtful one. You know, Barack Obama is a man of great dignity. And I could tell how much it bothered him and annoyed him that this was being touted and used against him. But I like to remember what Michelle Obama said in her amazing speech at our Democratic National Convention: When they go low, we go high. And Barack Obama went high, despite Donald Trumps best efforts to bring him down.",2016-09-26,Democrat
Holt,"Mr. Trump, you can respond and were going to move on to the next segment.",2016-09-26,Moderator
Trump,"I would love to respond. First of all, I got to watch in preparing for this some of your debates against Barack Obama. You treated him with terrible disrespect. And I watched the way you talk now about how lovely everything is and how wonderful you are. It doesnt work that way. You were after him, you were trying toyou even sent out or your campaign sent out pictures of him in a certain garb, very famous pictures. I dont think you can deny that. But just last week, your campaign manager said it was true. So when you tried to act holier than thou, it really doesnt work. It really doesnt. Now, as far as the lawsuit, yes, when I was very young, I went into my fathers company, had a real estate company in Brooklyn and Queens, and we, along with many, many other companies throughout the countryit was a federal lawsuitwere sued. We settled the suit with zerowith no admission of guilt. It was very easy to do. But they sued many people. I notice you bring that up a lot. And, you know, I also notice the very nasty commercials that you do on me in so many different ways, which I dont do on you. Maybe Im trying to save the money. But, frankly, I lookI look at that, and I say, isnt that amazing? Because I settled that lawsuit with no admission of guilt, but that was a lawsuit brought against many real estate firms, and its just one of those things. Ill go one step further. In Palm Beach, Florida, tough community, a brilliant community, a wealthy community, probably the wealthiest community there is in the world, I opened a club, and really got great credit for it. No discrimination against African-Americans, against Muslims, against anybody. And its a tremendously successful club. And Im so glad I did it. And I have been given great credit for what I did. And Im very, very proud of it. And thats the way I feel. That is the true way I feel.",2016-09-26,Republican

There are the independent hacking groups that do it mostly for commercial reasons to try to steal information that they then can use to make money. tough, long game here. And one of the things hes done is to let loose cyber attackers to hack into government files, to hack into personal files, hack into the Democratic National Committee. And we recently have learned that, you know, that this is one of their preferred methods of trying to wreak havoc and collect information. We need to make it very clearwhether its Russia, China, Iran or anybody elsethe United States has much greater capacity. And we are not going to sit idly by and permit state actors to go after our information, our private-sector information or our public-sector information. And were going to have to make it clear that we dont want to use the kinds of tools that we have. We dont want to engage in a different kind of warfare.

Trump,"I do want to say that I was just endorsedand more are coming next weekit will be over 200 admirals, many of them hereadmirals and generals endorsed me to lead this country. That just happened, and many more are coming. And Im very proud of it. In addition, I was just endorsed by ICE. Theyve never endorsed anybody before on immigration. I was just endorsed by ICE. I was just recently endorsed16,500 Border Patrol agents. So when Secretary Clinton talks about this, I mean, Ill take the admirals and Ill take the generals any day over the political hacks that I see that have led our country so brilliantly over the last 10 years with their knowledge. OK? Because look at the mess that were in. Look at the mess that were in. You dont know who broke in to DNC. But what did we learn with DNC? We learned that Bernie Sanders was taken advantage of by your people, by Debbie Wasserman Schultz. Look what happened to her. But Bernie Sanders was taken advantage of. Thats what we learned. Now, whether that was Russia, whether that was China, whether it was another country, we dont know, because the truth is, under President Obama weve lost control of things that we used to have control over. We came in with the Internet, we came up with the Internet, and I think Secretary Clinton and myself would agree very much, when you look at what ISIS is doing with the Internet, theyre beating us at our own game. ISIS. So we have to get very, very tough on cyber and cyber warfare. It isit is a huge problem. I have a son. Hes 10 years old. He has computers. He is so good with these computers, its unbelievable. The security aspect of cyber is very, very tough. And maybe its hardly doable. But I will say, we are not doing the job we should be doing. But thats true throughout our whole governmental society. We have so many things that we have to do better, Lester, and certainly cyber is one of them.",2016-09-26,Republican
Holt,Secretary Clinton?,2016-09-26,Moderator
Clinton,"Well, I think there are a number of issues that we should be addressing. I have put forth a plan to defeat ISIS. It does involve going after them online. I think we need to do much more with our tech companies to prevent ISIS and their operatives from being able to use the Internet to radicalize, even direct people in our country and Europe and elsewhere. But we also have to intensify our air strikes against ISIS and eventually support our Arab and Kurdish partners to be able to actually take out ISIS in Raqqa, end their claim of being a Caliphate. Were making progress. Our military is assisting in Iraq. And were hoping that within the year well be able to push ISIS out of Iraq and then, you know, really squeeze them in Syria. But we have to be cognizant of the fact that theyve had foreign fighters coming to volunteer for them, foreign money, foreign weapons, so we have to make this the top priority. And I would also do everything possible to take out their leadership. I was involved in a number of efforts to take out Al Qaida leadership when I was secretary of state, including, of course, taking out bin Laden. And I think we need to go after Baghdadi, as well, make that one of our organizing principles. Because weve got to defeat ISIS, and weve got to do everything we can to disrupt their propaganda efforts online.",2016-09-26,Democrat
Holt,"You mention ISIS, and we think of ISIS certainly as over there, but there are American citizens who have been inspired to commit acts of terror on American soil, the latest incident, of course, the bombings we just saw in New York and New Jersey, the knife attack at a mall in Minnesota, in the last year, deadly attacks in San Bernardino and Orlando. Ill ask this to both of you. Tell us specifically how you would prevent homegrown attacks by American citizens, Mr. Trump?",2016-09-26,Moderator
Trump,"Well, first I have to say one thing, very important. Secretary Clinton is talking about taking out ISIS. We will take out ISIS. Well, President Obama and Secretary Clinton created a vacuum the way they got out of Iraq, because they got outwhat, they shouldnt have been in, but once they got in, the way they got out was a disaster. And ISIS was formed. So she talks about taking them out. Shes been doing it a long time. Shes been trying to take them out for a long time. But they wouldnt have even been formed if they left some troops behind, like 10,000 or maybe something more than that. And then you wouldnt have had them. Or, as Ive been saying for a long time, and I think youll agree, because I said it to you once, had we taken the oiland we should have taken the oilISIS would not have been able to form either, because the oil was their primary source of income. And now they have the oil all over the place, including the oila lot of the oil in Libya, which was another one of her disasters.",2016-09-26,Republican

Clinton,"He actually advocated for the actions we took in Libya and urged that Gadhafi be taken out, after actually doing some business with him one time. But the larger pointand he says this constantlyis George W. Bush made the agreement about when American troops would leave Iraq, not Barack Obama. And the only way that American troops could have stayed in Iraq is to get an agreement from the then-Iraqi government that would have protected our troops, and the Iraqi government would not give that. And I think weve got to have an intelligence surge, where we are looking for every scrap of information. I was so proud of law enforcement in New York, in Minnesota, in New Jersey. You know, they responded so quickly, so professionally to the attacks that occurred by Rahami. And they brought him down. And we may find out more information because he is still alive, which may prove to be an intelligence benefit. So weve got to do everything we can to vacuum up intelligence from Europe, from the Middle East. That means weve got to work more closely with our allies, and thats something that Donald has been very dismissive of. Were working with NATO, the longest military alliance in the history of the world, to really turn our attention to terrorism. Were working with our friends in the Middle East, many of which, as you know, are Muslim majority nations. Donald has consistently insulted Muslims abroad, Muslims at home, when we need to be cooperating with Muslim nations and with the American Muslim community. Theyre on the front lines. They can provide information to us that we might not get anywhere else. They need to have close working cooperation with law enforcement in these communities, not be alienated and pushed away as some of Donalds rhetoric, unfortunately, has led to.",2016-09-26,Democrat

And now theyre going to be actually probably a major power at some point pretty soon, the way theyre going. But when you look at NATO, I was asked on a major show, what do you think of NATO? And you have to understand, Im a businessperson. I did really well. But I have common sense. And I said, well, Ill tell you. I havent given lots of thought to NATO. But two things. Number one, the 28 countries of NATO, many of them arent paying their fair share. Number twoand that bothers me, because we should be askingwere defending them, and they should at least be paying us what theyre supposed to be paying by treaty and contract. And, number two, I said, and very strongly, NATO could be obsolete, becauseand I was very strong on this, and it was actually covered very accurately in the New York Times, which is unusual for the New York Times, to be honestbut I said, they do not focus on terror. And I was very strong. And I said it numerous times. And about four months ago, I read on the front page of the Wall Street Journal that NATO is opening up a major terror division. And I think thats great. And I think we should getbecause we pay approximately 73 percent of the cost of NATO. Its a lot of money to protect other people. But Im all for NATO.

Holt,Secretary Clinton?,2016-09-26,Moderator
Clinton,"Whew, OK. [laughter] Lets talk about two important issues that were briefly mentioned by Donald, first, NATO. You know, NATO as a military alliance has something called Article 5, and basically it says this: An attack on one is an attack on all. And you know the only time its ever been invoked? After 9/11, when the 28 nations of NATO said that they would go to Afghanistan with us to fight terrorism, something that they still are doing by our side. With respect to Iran, when I became secretary of state, Iran was weeks away from having enough nuclear material to form a bomb. They had mastered the nuclear fuel cycle under the Bush administration. They had built covert facilities. They had stocked them with centrifuges that were whirling away. And we had sanctioned them. I voted for every sanction against Iran when I was in the Senate, but it wasnt enough. So I spent a year-and-a-half putting together a coalition that included Russia and China to impose the toughest sanctions on Iran. And we did drive them to the negotiating table. And my successor, John Kerry, and President Obama got a deal that put a lid on Irans nuclear program without firing a single shot. Thats diplomacy. Thats coalition-building. Thats working with other nations. The other day, I saw Donald saying that there were some Iranian sailors on a ship in the waters off of Iran, and they were taunting American sailors who were on a nearby ship.

On nuclear weapons, President Obama reportedly considered changing the nations longstanding policy on first use. Do you support the current policy? Mr. Trump, you have two minutes on that.",2016-09-26,Moderator
Trump,"Well, I have to say that, you know, for what Secretary Clinton was saying about nuclear with Russia, shes very cavalier in the way she talks about various countries. But Russia has been expanding theirthey have a much newer capability than we do. We have not been updating from the new standpoint. I looked the other night. I was seeing B-52s, theyre old enough that your father, your grandfather could be flying them. We are notwe are not keeping up with other countries. I would like everybody to end it, just get rid of it. But I would certainly not do first strike. I think that once the nuclear alternative happens, its over. At the same time, we have to be prepared. I cant take anything off the table. Because you look at some of these countries, you look at North Korea, were doing nothing there. China should solve that problem for us. China should go into North Korea. China is totally powerful as it relates to North Korea. And by the way, another one powerful is the worst deal I think Ive ever seen negotiated that you started is the Iran deal. Iran is one of their biggest trading partners. Iran has power over North Korea. And when they made that horrible deal with Iran, they should have included the fact that they do something with respect to North Korea. And they should have done something with respect to Yemen and all these other places. And when asked to Secretary Kerry, why didnt you do that? Why didnt you add other things into the deal? One of the great giveaways of all time, of all time, including $400 million in cash. Nobodys ever seen that before. That turned out to be wrong. It was actually $1.7 billion in cash, obviously, I guess for the hostages. It certainly looks that way. So you say to yourself, why didnt they make the right deal? This is one of the worst deals ever made by any country in history. The deal with Iran will lead to nuclear problems. All they have to do is sit back 10 years, and they dont have to do much.",2016-09-26,Republican

Clinton,"Well, let melet me start by saying, words matter. Words matter when you run for president. And they really matter when you are president. And I want to reassure our allies in Japan and South Korea and elsewhere that we have mutual defense treaties and we will honor them. It is essential that Americas word be good. And so I know that this campaign has caused some questioning and some worries on the part of many leaders across the globe. Ive talked with a number of them. But I want toon behalf of myself, and I think on behalf of a majority of the American people, say that, you know, our word is good. Its also important that we look at the entire global situation. Theres no doubt that we have other problems with Iran. But personally, Id rather deal with the other problems having put that lid on their nuclear program than still to be facing that. And Donald never tells you what he would do. Would he have started a war? Would he have bombed Iran? If hes going to criticize a deal that has been very successful in giving us access to Iranian facilities that we never had before, then he should tell us what his alternative would be. But its like his plan to defeat ISIS. He says its a secret plan, but the only secret is that he has no plan. So we need to be more precise in how we talk about these issues. People around the word follow our presidential campaigns so closely, trying to get hints about what we will do. Can they rely on us? Are we going to lead the world with strength and in accordance with our values? Thats what I intend to do.

Speakers,"VICE PRESIDENT JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR. REP. PAUL D. RYAN, R-WIS. MARTHA RADDATZ, MODERATOR[*]RADDATZ: Good evening, and welcome to the first and only vice presidential debate of 2012, sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates. Im Martha Raddatz of ABC News, and I am honored to moderate this debate between two men who have dedicated much of their lives to public service. Tonights debate is divided between domestic and foreign policy issues. And Im going to move back and forth between foreign and domestic, since that is what a vice president or president would have to do. We will have nine different segments. At the beginning of each segment, I will ask both candidates a question, and they will each have two minutes to answer. Then I will encourage a discussion between the candidates with follow-up questions. By coin toss, it has been determined that Vice President Biden will be first to answer the opening question. We have a wonderful audience here at Centre College tonight. You will no doubt hear their enthusiasm at the end of the debate  and right now, as we welcome Vice President Joe Biden and Congressman Paul Ryan. OK, you got your little wave to the families in. Its great. Good evening, gentlemen. It really is an honor to be here with both of you. I would like to begin with Libya. On a rather somber note, one month ago tonight, on the anniversary of 9/11, Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other brave Americans were killed in a terrorist attack in Benghazi. The State Department has now made clear, there were no protesters there.",2012-10-11,Moderator
Raddatz,"it was a pre-planned assault by heavily armed men. Wasnt this a massive intelligence failure, Vice President Biden?",2012-10-11,Moderator
Biden,"What is was, it was a tragedy, Martha. It  Chris Stevens was one of our best. We lost three other brave Americans. I can make absolutely two commitments to you and all the American people tonight. One, we will find and bring to justice the men who did this. And secondly, we will get to the bottom of it, and whatever  wherever the facts lead us, wherever they lead us, we will make clear to the American public, because whatever mistakes were made will not be made again. When youre looking at a president, Martha, it seems to me that you should take a look at his most important responsibility. Thats caring for the national security of the country. And the best way to do that is take a look at how hes handled the issues of the day. On Iraq, the president said he would end the war. Governor Romney said that was a tragic mistake, we should have left 30,000  he ended it. Governor Romney said that was a tragic mistake, we should have left 30,000 troops there. With regard to Afghanistan, he said he will end the war in 2014. Governor Romney said we should not set a date, number one. And number two, with regard to 2014, it depends. When it came to Osama bin Laden, the president the first day in office, I was sitting with him in the Oval Office, he called in the CIA and signed an order saying, My highest priority is to get bin Laden. Prior to the election, prior to the  him being sworn in, Governor Romney was asked the question about how he would proceed. He said, I wouldnt move heaven and earth to get bin Laden. He didnt understand it was more than about taking a murderer off the battlefield. It was about restoring Americas heart and letting terrorists around the world know, if you do harm to America, we will track you to the gates of hell if need be. And lastly, the president of the United States has  has led with a steady hand and clear vision. Governor Romney, the opposite. The last thing we need now is another war.",2012-10-11,Democrat

Ryan,"When you take a look at what has happened just in the last few weeks, they sent the U.N. ambassador out to say that this was because of a protest and a YouTube video. It took the president two weeks to acknowledge that this was a terrorist attack. He went to the U.N. and in his speech at the U.N. he said six times  he talked about the YouTube video. This is becoming more troubling by the day. They first blamed the YouTube video. Now theyre trying to blame the Romney-Ryan ticket for making this an issue. With respect to Iraq, we had the same position before the withdrawal, which was we agreed with the Obama administration. Lets have a status of forces agreement to make sure that we secure our gains. The vice president was put in charge of those negotiations by President Obama and they failed to get the agreement. We dont have a status of forces agreement because they failed to get one. Thats what we are talking about. Now, when it comes to our veterans, we owe them a great debt of gratitude for what theyve done for us, including your son Beau. But we also want to make sure that we dont lose the things we fought so hard to get. Now, with respect to Afghanistan, the 2014 deadline, we agree with a 2014 transition. But what we also want it do is make sure that were not projecting weakness abroad, and thats whats happening here.",2012-10-11,Republican

Raddatz,"I just want to you about right in the middle of the crisis. Governor Romney, and youre talking about this again tonight, talked about the weakness; talked about apologies from the Obama administration. Was that really appropriate right in the middle of the crisis?",2012-10-11,Moderator
Ryan,"On that same day, the Obama administration had the exact same position. Lets recall that they disavowed their own statement that they had put out earlier in the day in Cairo. So we had the same position, but we will  its never too early to speak out for our values. We should have spoken out right away when the green revolution was up and starting; when the mullahs in Iran were attacking their people. We should not have called Bashar Assad a reformer when he was turning his Russian-provided guns on his own people. We should always stand up for peace, for democracy, for individual rights.",2012-10-11,Republican

Biden,"I will be very specific. Number one, the  this lecture on embassy security  the congressman here cut embassy security in his budget by $300 million below what we asked for, number one. So much for the embassy security piece. Number two, Governor Romney, before he knew the facts, before he even knew that our ambassador was killed, he was out making a political statement which was panned by the media around the world. And this talk about this  this weakness. I  I dont understand what my friends talking about here. We  this is a president whos gone out and done everything he has said he was going to do. This is a guy whos repaired our alliances so the rest of the world follows us again.

Biden,"Because that was exactly what we were told by the intelligence community. The intelligence community told us that. As they learned more facts about exactly what happened, they changed their assessment. Thats why theres also an investigation headed by Tom Pickering, a leading diplomat from the Reagan years, who is doing an investigation as to whether or not there are any lapses, what the lapses were, so that they will never happen again.",2012-10-11,Democrat

And as the intelligence community changed their view, we made it clear they changed their view. Thats why I said we will get to the bottom of this. You know, usually when theres a crisis, we pull together. We pull together as a nation.

Ryan,Absolutely.,2012-10-11,Republican
Raddatz," this country is facing. Both President Obama and Governor Romney have said they will prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon, even if that means military action. Last week, former Defense Secretary Bob Gates said a strike on Irans facilities would not work and, quote, could prove catastrophic, haunting us for generations. Can the two of you be absolutely clear and specific to the American people how effective would a military strike be? Congressman Ryan?",2012-10-11,Moderator
Ryan,"We cannot allow Iran to gain a nuclear weapons capability. Now, lets take a look at where weve gone  come from. When Barack Obama was elected, they had enough fissile material  nuclear material to make one bomb. Now they have enough for five. Theyre racing toward a nuclear weapon. Theyre four years closer toward a nuclear weapons capability. Weve had four different sanctions, the U.N. on Iran, three from the Bush administration, one here. And the only reason we got it is because Russia watered it down and prevented the  the sanctions from hitting the central bank. Mitt Romney proposed these sanctions in 2007. In Congress, Ive been fighting for these sanctions since 2009. The administration was blocking us every step of the way. Only because we had strong bipartisan support for these tough sanctions were we able to overrule their objections and put them in spite of the administration. Imagine what would have happened if we had these sanctions in place earlier. You think Irans not brazen? Look at what theyre doing. Theyre stepping up their terrorist attacks. They tried a terrorist attack in the United States last year when they tried to blow up the Saudi ambassador at a restaurant in Washington, D.C. And talk about credibility? When this administration says that all options are on the table, they send out senior administration officials that send all these mixed signals. And so, in order to solve this peacefully  which is everybodys goal  you have to have the ayatollahs change their minds. Look at where they are. Theyre moving faster toward a nuclear weapon. Its because this administration has no credibility on this issue. Its because this administration watered down sanctions, delayed sanctions, tried to stop us for putting the tough sanctions in place. Now we have them in place because of Congress. They say the military options on the table, but its not being viewed as credible. And the key is to do this peacefully, is to make sure that we have credibility. Under a Romney administration, we will have credibility on this issue.",2012-10-11,Republican
Raddatz,Vice President Biden?,2012-10-11,Moderator

Period.",2012-10-11,Democrat
Ryan,We want to prevent war.,2012-10-11,Republican
Biden,"And the interesting thing is, how are they going to prevent war? How are they going to prevent war if they say theres nothing more that we  that they say we should do than what weve already done, number one. And number two, with regard to the ability of the United States to take action militarily, it is  it is not in my purview to talk about classified information. But we feel quite confident we could deal a serious blow to the Iranians. But number two, the Iranians are  the Israelis and the United States, our military and intelligence communities are absolutely the same exact place in terms of how close  how close the Iranians are to getting a nuclear weapon. They are a good way away. There is no difference between our view and theirs. When my friend talks about fissile material, they have to take this highly enriched uranium, get it from 20 percent up, then they have to be able to have something to put it in. There is no weapon that the Iranians have at this point. Both the Israelis and we know  well know if they start the process of building a weapon. So all this bluster I keep hearing, all this loose talk, what are they talking about? Are you talking about, to be more credible  what more can the president do, stand before the United Nations, tell the whole world, directly communicate to the ayatollah, we will not let them acquire a nuclear weapon, period, unless hes talking about going to war.",2012-10-11,Democrat

Raddatz,"Congressman Ryan? RYAN: Lets look at this from the view of the ayatollahs. What do they see? They see this administration trying to water down sanctions in Congress for over two years. Theyre moving faster toward a nuclear weapon. Theyre spinning the centrifuges faster. They see us saying when we come into the administration, when theyre sworn in, we need more space with our ally, Israel. They see President Obama in New York City the same day Bibi Netanyahu is and he, instead of meeting with him, goes on a  on a daily talk show. They see, when we say that these options are on the table, the secretary of defense walked them back. They are not changing their mind. Thats what we have to do, is change their mind so they stop pursuing nuclear weapons, and theyre going faster.",2012-10-11,Moderator

Now, with regard to Bibi, whos been my friend 39 years, the president has met with Bibi a dozen times. Hes spoken to Bibi Netanyahu as much as hes spoken to anybody.

Biden,"We Irish call it malarkey. But last thing. The secretary of defense has made it absolutely clear, we didnt walk anything back. We will not allow the Iranians to get a nuclear weapon. What Bibi held up there was when they get to the point where they can enrich uranium enough to put into a weapon. They dont have a weapon to put it into. Lets all calm down a little bit here.

When they see us putting  when they see us putting daylight between ourselves and our allies in Israel, that gives them encouragement.

The percentage of unemployed just fell below 8 percent for the first time in 43 months. The Obama administration had projected that it would fall below 6 percent now after the addition of close to a trillion dollars in stimulus money.",2012-10-11,Moderator
Biden,"I dont know how long it will take. We can and we will get it under 6 percent. Lets look at  lets take a look at the facts. Lets look at where we were when we came to office. The economy was in free fall. We had  the great recession hit; 9 million people lost their job; $1.7  $1.6 trillion in wealth lost in equity in your homes, in retirement accounts for the middle class. We knew we had to act for the middle class. We immediately went out and rescued General Motors. We went ahead and made sure that we cut taxes for the middle class. And in addition to that, when that  when that occurred, what did Romney do? Romney said, No, let Detroit go bankrupt. We moved in and helped people refinance their homes. Governor Romney said, No, let foreclosures hit the bottom. But it shouldnt be surprising for a guy who says 47 percent of the American people are unwilling to take responsibility for their own lives. My friend recently in a speech in Washington said 30 percent of the American people are takers. These people are my mom and dad  the people I grew up with, my neighbors. They pay more effective tax than Governor Romney pays in his federal income tax. They are elderly people who in fact are living off of Social Security. They are veterans and people fighting in Afghanistan right now who are, quote, not paying any tax. Ive had it up to here with this notion that 47 percent  its about time they take some responsibility here. And instead of signing pledges to Grover Norquist not to ask the wealthiest among us to contribute to bring back the middle class, they should be signing a pledge saying to the middle class were going to level the playing field; were going to give you a fair shot again; we are going to not repeat the mistakes we made in the past by having a different set of rules for Wall Street and Main Street, making sure that we continue to hemorrhage these tax cuts for the super wealthy.",2012-10-11,Democrat
Biden,"Theyre pushing the continuation of a tax cut that will give an additional $500 billion in tax cuts to 120,000 families.

Were heading in the wrong direction; 23 million Americans are struggling for work today; 15 percent of Americans are living in poverty today. This is not what a real recovery looks like. We need real reforms for real recovery and thats exactly what Mitt Romney and I are proposing. Its a five-point plan. Get America energy independent in North America by the end of the decade. Help people who are hurting get the skills they need to get the jobs they want. Get this deficit and debt under control to prevent a debt crisis.

Two of them, Rob and Reed, were paralyzed. The Romneys didnt know them. They went to the same church; they never met before. Mitt asked if he could come over on Christmas. He brought his boys, his wife, and gifts. Later on, he said, I know youre struggling, Mark. Dont worry about their college. Ill pay for it. When Mark told me this story, because, you know what, Mitt Romney doesnt tell these stories. The Nixons told this story. When he told me this story, he said it wasnt the help, the cash help. Its that he gave his time, and he has consistently. This is a man who gave 30 percent of his income to charity, more than the two of us combined. Mitt Romneys a good man.

Look, I dont doubt his personal generosity. And I understand what its like. When I was a little younger than the congressman, my wife was in an accident, killed my daughter and my wife, and my two sons survived. I have sat in the homes of many people whove gone through what I get through, because the one thing you can give people solace is to know if they know youve been through it, that they can make it. So I dont doubt his personal commitment to individuals. But you know what? I know he had no commitment to the automobile industry. He just  he said, let it go bankrupt, period. Let it drop out. All this talk  we saved a million jobs. Two hundred thousand people are working today. And Ive never met two guys whore more down on America across the board. Were told everythings going bad. There are 5.2 million new jobs, private-sector jobs. We need more, but 5.2 million  if theyd get out of the way, if theyd get out of the way and let us pass the tax cut for the middle class, make it permanent, if they get out of the way and pass the  pass the jobs bill, if they get out of the way and let us allow 14 million people who are struggling to stay in their homes because their mortgages are upside down, but they never missed a mortgage payment, just get out of the way. Stop talking about how you care about people. Show me something. Show me a policy. Show me a policy where you take responsibility. And, by the way, they talk about this Great Recession if it fell out of the sky, like, Oh, my goodness, where did it come from? It came from this man voting to put two wars on a credit card, to at the same time put a prescription drug benefit on the credit card, a trillion-dollar tax cut for the very wealthy. I was there.

Ryan,"Absolutely. Medicare and Social Security are going bankrupt. These are indisputable facts. Look, when I look at these programs, weve all had tragedies in our lives. I think about what theyve done for my own family. My mom and I had my grandmother move in with us who was facing Alzheimers. Medicare was there for here, just like its there for my mom right now who is a Florida senior. After my dad died, my mom and I got Social Security survivors benefits, helped me pay for college, it helped her go back to college in her 50s where she started a small business because of the new skills she got. She paid all of her taxes on the promise that these programs would be there for her. We will honor this promise. And the best way to do it is reform it for my generation. You see, if you reform these programs for my generation, people 54 and below, you can guarantee they dont change for people in or near retirement, which is precisely what Mitt Romney and I are proposing. Look what  look what Obamacare does. Obamacare takes $716 billion from Medicare to spend on Obamacare. Even their own chief actuary at Medicare backs this up. He says you cant spend the same dollar twice. You cant claim that this money goes to Medicare and Obamacare.",2012-10-11,Republican

This board, by the way, its 15 people, the presidents supposed to appoint them next year. And not one of them even has to have medical training. And Social Security? If we dont shore up Social Security, when we run out of the IOUs, when the program goes bankrupt, a 25 percent across-the-board benefit cut kicks in on current seniors in the middle of their retirement. Were going to stop that from happening. They havent put a credible solution on the table. Hell tell you about vouchers. Hell say all these things to try and scare people. Heres what were saying: give younger people, when they become Medicare eligible, guaranteed coverage options that you cant be denied, including traditional Medicare. Choose your plan, and then Medicare subsidizes your premiums, not as much for the wealthy people, more coverage for middle-income people, and total out-of-pocket coverage for the poor and the sick. Choice and competition. We would rather have 50 million future seniors determine how their Medicare is delivered to them instead of 15 bureaucrats deciding what, if, when, where they get it.",2012-10-11,Republican

What we did is, we saved $716 billion and put it back, applied it to Medicare. We cut the cost of Medicare. We stopped overpaying insurance companies, doctors and hospitals. The AMA supported what we did. AARP endorsed what we did. And it extends the life of Medicare to 2024. They want to wipe this all out. It also gave more benefits. Any senior out there, ask yourself: Do you have more benefits today? You do. If youre near the donut hole, you have $800  $600 more to help your prescription drug costs. You get wellness visits without co-pays. They wipe all of this out, and Medicare goes  becomes insolvent in 2016, number one. Number two, guaranteed benefit? Its a voucher. When they first proposed  when the congressman had his first voucher program, the CBO said it would cost $6,400 a year, Martha, more for every senior, 55 and below, when they got there. He knew that, yet he got all the guys in Congress and women in the Republican Party to vote for it. Governor Romney, knowing that, said, I would sign it, were I there. Now they got a new plan: Trust me, its not going to cost you any more. Folks, follow your instincts on this one. And with regard to Social Security, we will not  we will not privatize it.

Biden,"The middle class will pay less and people making $1 million or more will begin to contribute slightly more. Let me give you one concrete example. The continuation of the Bush tax cuts  we are arguing that the Bush tax cuts for the wealthy should be allowed to expire. Of the Bush tax cuts for the wealthy, $800 million  billion of that goes to people making a minimum of $1 million. We see no justification in these economic times for those, and theyre patriotic Americans. Theyre not asking for this continued tax cut. Theyre not suggesting it, but my friends are insisting on it; 120,000 families by continuing that tax cut will get an additional $500 billion in tax relief in the next 10 years and their income is an average of $8 million. We want to extend permanently the middle-class tax cut for  permanently, from the Bush middle-class tax cut. These guys wont allow us to. You know what theyre saying? We say lets have a vote  lets have a vote on the middle-class tax cut and lets have a vote on the upper (ph) tax cut; lets go ahead and vote on it. Theyre saying no. Theyre holding hostage the middle class tax cut to the super wealthy. And on top of that, theyve got another tax cut coming thats $5 trillion that all of the studies point out will in fact give another $250 million  yeah, $250,000 a year to those 120,000 families and raise taxes for people who are middle income with a child by $2,000 a year. This is unconscionable. There is no need for this. The middle class got knocked on their heels. The great recession crushed them. They need some help now. The last people who need help are 120,000 families for another  another $500 billion tax cut over the next 10 years.",2012-10-11,Democrat

President Obama thinks that the government ought to be able to take as much as 44.8 percent of a small businesss income.",2012-10-11,Republican
Ryan,"Look, if you taxed every person and successful business making over $250,000 at 100 percent, it would only run the government for 98 days. If everybody who paid income taxes last year, including successful small businesses, doubled their income taxes this year, wed still have a $300 billion deficit. You see? There arent enough rich people and small businesses to tax to pay for all their spending. And so the next time you hear them say, Dont worry about it, well get a few wealthy people to pay their fair share, watch out, middle class, the tax bills coming to you. Thats why were saying we need fundamental tax reform. Lets take a look at it this way. Eight out of 10 businesses, they file their taxes as individuals, not as corporations. And where I come from, overseas, which is Lake Superior, the Canadians, they dropped their tax rates to 15 percent. The average tax rate on businesses in the industrialized world is 25 percent, and the president wants the top effective tax rate on successful small businesses to go above 40 percent. Two-thirds of our jobs come from small businesses. This one tax would actually tax about 53 percent of small-business income. Its expected to cost us 710,000 jobs. And you know what? It doesnt even pay for 10 percent of their proposed deficit spending increases. What we are saying is, lower tax rates across the board and close loopholes, primarily to the higher-income people. We have three bottom lines: Dont raise the deficit, dont raise taxes on the middle class, and dont lower the share of income that is borne by the high-income earners. Hell keep saying this $5 trillion plan, I suppose. Its been discredited by six other studies. And even their own deputy campaign manager acknowledged that it wasnt correct.",2012-10-11,Republican

Let me tell you who some of those other small businesses are: hedge funds that make $600 million, $800 million a year. Thats  thats what they count as small businesses, because theyre pass- through.

Youve been there more than the two of us combined. First time I was there in 2002, it was amazing to me what they were facing. When I went to the Ahgandah (ph) Valley in Kandahar before the surge, I sat down with a young private in the 82nd from the Monamanee (ph) Indian reservation who would tell me what he did every day, and I was in awe. And to see what they had in front of them. And then to go back there in December, to go throughout Helmand with the Marines, to see what they had accomplished, its nothing short of amazing. What we dont want to do is lose the gains weve gotten. Now, weve disagreed from time to time on a few issues. We would have more likely taken into accounts the recommendations from our commanders, General Petraeus, Admiral Mullen, on troop levels throughout this years fighting season. Weve been skeptical about negotiations with the Taliban, especially while theyre shooting at us.

Weve decimated Al Qaida central. We have eliminated Osama bin Laden. That was our purpose. And, in fact, in the meantime, what we said we would do, we would help train the Afghan military. Its their responsibility to take over their own security. Thats why with 49 of our allies in Afghanistan, weve agreed on a gradual drawdown so were out of there by the year 20  in the year 2014. My friend and the governor say its based on conditions, which means it depends. It does not depend for us. It is the responsibility of the Afghans to take care of their own security.

Thats what we call fighting seasons. In the warm months, fighting gets really high. In the winter, it goes down. And so when Admiral Mullen and General Petraeus came to Congress and said, if you pull these people out before the fighting season is end, it puts people more at risk. Thats the problem.

Raddatz,"Lets move to another war, the civil war in Syria, where there are estimates that more  estimates that more than 25,000, 30,000 people have now been killed. In March of last year, President Obama explained the military action taken in Libya by saying it was in the national interest to go in and prevent further massacres from occurring there. So why doesnt the same logic apply in Syria? Vice President Biden?",2012-10-11,Moderator
Biden,"Different country. Its a different country. It is five times as large geographically, it has one-fifth the population, that is Libya, one-fifth the population, five times as large geographically. Its in a part of the world where theyre not going to see whatever would come from that war. It seep into a regional war. Youre in a country that is heavily populated in the midst of the most dangerous area in the world. And, in fact, if in fact it blows up and the wrong people gain control, its going to have impact on the entire region causing potentially regional wars. We are working hand and glove with the Turks, with the Jordanians, with the Saudis, and with all the people in the region attempting to identify the people who deserve the help so that when Assad goes  and he will go  there will be a legitimate government that follows on, not an Al Qaida-sponsored government that follows on. The last thing America needs is to get in another ground war in the Middle East, requiring tens of thousands, if not well over 100,000 American forces. That  they are the facts. They are the facts. Now, every time the governor is asked about this, he doesnt say anything. He  he goes up with a whole lot of verbiage, but when he gets pressed he says, no, he would not do anything different than we are doing now. Are they proposing putting American troops on the ground? Putting American aircraft in the airspace? Is that what theyre proposing? If they do, they should speak up and say so, but thats not what theyre saying. We are doing it exactly like we need to do to identify those forces who, in fact, will provide for a stable government and not cause a regional Sunni-Shia war when Bassad (sic)  when Bashar Assad falls.",2012-10-11,Democrat
Raddatz,Congressman Ryan?,2012-10-11,Moderator
Ryan,"Nobody is proposing to send troops to Syria. American troops. Now, let me say it this way. How would we do things differently? We wouldnt refer to Bashar Assad as a reformer when hes killing his own civilians with his Russian-provided weapons. We wouldnt be outsourcing our foreign policy to the United Nations giving Vladimir Putin veto power over our efforts to try and deal with this issue. Hes vetoed three of them. Hillary Clinton went to Russia to try and convince them not to do so. They thwarted her efforts. She said they were on the wrong side of history. She was right about that. This is just one more example of how the Russia resets not working. And so where are we? After international pressure mounted, the President Obama said Bashar Assad should go. Its been over a year. The man has slaughtered tens of thousands of his own people. And more foreign fighters are spilling into this country. So the longer this has gone on, the more people, groups like Al Qaida are going in. We could have more easily identified the free Syrian army, the freedom fighters, working with our allies, the Turks, the Qataris, the Saudis, had we had a better plan in place to begin with working through our allies. But, no, we waited for Kofi Annan to try and come up with an agreement through the U.N. That bought Bashar Assad time. We gave Russia veto power over our efforts through the U.N. And meanwhile about 30,000 Syrians are dead.",2012-10-11,Republican

That is underway. Our allies were all on the same page, NATO, as well as our Arab allies, in terms of trying to get a settlement. That was their idea. Were the ones that said, Enough.

Ryan,"Now, you want to ask basically why Im pro-life? Its not simply because of my Catholic faith. Thats a factor, of course. But its also because of reason and science. You know, I think about 10 1/2 years ago, my wife Janna and I went to Mercy Hospital in Janesville where I was born, for our seven week ultrasound for our firstborn child, and we saw that heartbeat. A little baby was in the shape of a bean. And to this day, we have nicknamed our firstborn child Liza, Bean. Now I believe that life begins at conception. Thats why  those are the reasons why Im pro-life. Now I understand this is a difficult issue, and I respect people who dont agree with me on this, but the policy of a Romney administration will be to oppose abortions with the exceptions for rape, incest and life of the mother. What troubles me more is how this administration has handled all of these issues. Look at what theyre doing through Obamacare with respect to assaulting the religious liberties of this country. Theyre infringing upon our first freedom, the freedom of religion, by infringing on Catholic charities, Catholic churches, Catholic hospitals. Our church should not have to sue our federal government to maintain their religious liberties. And with respect to abortion, the Democratic Party used to say they wanted it to be safe, legal and rare. Now they support it without restriction and with taxpayer funding. Taxpayer funding in Obamacare, taxpayer funding with foreign aid. The vice president himself went to China and said that he sympathized and wouldnt second guess their one child policy of forced abortions and sterilizations. That to me is pretty extreme.",2012-10-11,Republican

Biden,"My religion defines who I am, and Ive been a practicing Catholic my whole life. And has particularly informed my social doctrine. The Catholic social doctrine talks about taking care of those who  who cant take care of themselves, people who need help. With regard to  with regard to abortion, I accept my churchs position on abortion as a  what we call a (inaudible) doctrine. Life begins at conception in the churchs judgment. I accept it in my personal life. But I refuse to impose it on equally devout Christians and Muslims and Jews, and I just refuse to impose that on others, unlike my friend here, the  the congressman. I  I do not believe that we have a right to tell other people that  women they cant control their body. Its a decision between them and their doctor. In my view and the Supreme Court, Im not going to interfere with that. With regard to the assault on the Catholic church, let me make it absolutely clear, no religious institution, Catholic or otherwise, including Catholic Social Services, Georgetown Hospital, Mercy Hospital, any hospital, none has to either refer contraception, none has to pay for contraception, none has to be a vehicle to get contraception in any insurance policy they provide. That is a fact. That is a fact. Now with regard to the way in which the  we differ, my friend says that he  well I guess he accepts Governor Romneys position now, because in the past he has argued that there was  theres rape and forcible rape. Hes argued that in the case of rape or incest, it was still  it would be a crime to engage in having an abortion. I just fundamentally disagree with my friend.",2012-10-11,Democrat

Thats to equip those we send into harms way and care for those who come home. Thats the only sacred obligation we have. Everything else falls behind that. I would also tell him that the fact that he, this decorated soldier you talked about, fought for his country, that that should be honored. He should not be thrown into a category of a 47 percent who dont pay their taxes while he was out there fighting and not having to pay taxes, and somehow not taking responsibility. I would also tell him that there are things that have occurred in this campaign and occur in every campaign that Im sure both of us regret anyone having said, particularly in these  these special new groups that can go out there, raise all the money they want, not have to identify themselves, who say the most scurrilous things about the other candidate. Its  its an abomination. But the bottom line here is Id ask that hero you referenced to take a look at whether or not Governor Romney or President Obama has the conviction to help lift up the middle class, restore them to where they were before this great recession hit and they got wiped out. Or whether or not hes going to continue to focus on taking care of only the very wealthy, not asking them to make  pay any part of the deal to bring  bring back the middle class and the economy of this country. Id ask him to take a look at whether the president of the United States has acted wisely in the use of force and whether or not the slipshod comments being made by my  my  or by Governor Romney serve  serve our interests very well.

Second of all, Id say we are not going to impose these devastating cuts on our military which compromises their mission and their safety. And then I would say, you have a president who ran for president four years ago promising hope and change, who has now turned his campaign into attack, blame and defame. You see, if you dont have a good record to run on, then you paint your opponent as someone to run from. That was what President Obama said in 2008. Its what hes doing right now. Look at all the string of broken promises. If you like your health care plan, you can keep it. Try telling that to the 20 million people who are projected to lose their health insurance if Obamacare goes through or the 7-point million  7.4 million seniors who are going to lose it. Or remember when he said this: I guarantee if you make less than $250,000, your taxes wont go up. Of the 21 tax increases in Obamacare, 12 of them hit the middle class. Or remember when he said health insurance premiums will go down $2,500 per family, per year? Theyve gone up $3,000, and theyre expected to go up another $2,400. Or remember when he said, I promise by the end of my first term Ill cut the deficit in half in four years? Weve had four budgets, four trillion-dollar deficits. A debt crisis is coming. We cant keep spending and borrowing like this. We cant keep spending money we dont have. Leaders run to problem to fix problems. President Obama has not even put a credible plan on the table in any of his four years to deal with this debt crisis. I passed two budgets to deal with this. Mitt Romneys put ideas on the table. Weve got to tackle this debt crisis before it tackles us. The president likes to say he has a plan. He gave a speech. We asked his budget office, Can we see the plan? They sent us to the press secretary. He gave us a copy of the speech. We asked the Congressional Budget Office, Tell us what President Obamas plan is to prevent a debt crisis. They said, Its a speech, we cant estimate speeches. You see, thats what we get in this administration  speeches  but were not getting leadership. Mitt Romney is uniquely qualified to fix these problems. His lifetime of experience, his proven track record of bipartisanship. And what do we have from the president?

You will each have two minutes to respond and then we will have a general discussion until we move to the next segment. Tonights debate, as both of you know, comes on the 50th anniversary of the night that President Kennedy told the world that the Soviet Union had installed nuclear missiles in Cuba, perhaps the closest weve ever come to nuclear war.

Schieffer,"The first segment is the challenge of a changing Middle East and the new face of terrorism. Im going to put this into two segments so youll have two topic questions within this one segment on the subject. The first question, and it concerns Libya. The controversy over what happened there continues. Four Americans are dead, including an American ambassador. Questions remain. What happened? What caused it? Was it spontaneous? Was it an intelligence failure? Was it a policy failure? Was there an attempt to mislead people about what really happened? Governor Romney, you said this was an example of an American policy in the Middle East that is unraveling before our very eyes.",2012-10-22,Moderator
Schieffer,"Id like to hear each of you give your thoughts on that. Governor Romney, you won the toss. You go first.",2012-10-22,Moderator
Romney,"Thank you, Bob. And thank you for agreeing to moderate this debate this evening. Thank you to Lynn University for welcoming us here. And Mr. President, its good to be with you again. We were together at a humorous event a little earlier, and its nice to maybe funny this time, not on purpose. Well see what happens. This is obviously an area of great concern to the entire world, and to America in particular, which is to see a  a complete change in the  the structure and the  the environment in the Middle East. With the Arab Spring, came a great deal of hope that there would be a change towards more moderation, and opportunity for greater participation on the part of women in public life, and in economic life in the Middle East. But instead, weve seen in nation after nation, a number of disturbing events. Of course we see in Syria, 30,000 civilians having been killed by the military there. We see in  in Libya, an attack apparently by, I think we know now, by terrorists of some kind against  against our people there, four people dead. Our hearts and  and minds go out to them. Mali has been taken over, the northern part of Mali by al-Qaeda type individuals. We have in  in Egypt, a Muslim Brotherhood president. And so what were seeing is a pretty dramatic reversal in the kind of hopes we had for that region. Of course the greatest threat of all is Iran, four years closer to a nuclear weapon. And  and were going to have to recognize that we have to do as the president has done. I congratulate him on  on taking out Osama bin Laden and going after the leadership in al-Qaeda. But we cant kill our way out of this mess. Were going to have to put in place a very comprehensive and robust strategy to help the  the world of Islam and other parts of the world, reject this radical violent extremism, which is  its certainly not on the run.",2012-10-22,Republican
Romney,"Its certainly not hiding. This is a group that is now involved in 10 or 12 countries, and it presents an enormous threat to our friends, to the world, to America, long term, and we must have a comprehensive strategy to help reject this kind of extremism.",2012-10-22,Republican
Schieffer,Mr. President?,2012-10-22,Moderator
Obama,"Well, my first job as commander in chief, Bob, is to keep the American people safe. And thats what weve done over the last four years. We ended the war in Iraq, refocused our attention on those who actually killed us on 9/11. And as a consequence, Al Qaedas core leadership has been decimated. In addition, were now able to transition out of Afghanistan in a responsible way, making sure that Afghans take responsibility for their own security. And that allows us also to rebuild alliances and make friends around the world to combat future threats. Now with respect to Libya, as I indicated in the last debate, when we received that phone call, I immediately made sure that, number one, that we did everything we could to secure those Americans who were still in harms way; number two, that we would investigate exactly what happened, and number three, most importantly, that we would go after those who killed Americans and we would bring them to justice. And thats exactly what were going to do. But I think its important to step back and think about what happened in Libya. Keep in mind that I and Americans took leadership in organizing an international coalition that made sure that we were able to, without putting troops on the ground at the cost of less than what we spent in two weeks in Iraq, liberate a country that had been under the yoke of dictatorship for 40 years. Got rid of a despot who had killed Americans and as a consequence, despite this tragedy, you had tens of thousands of Libyans after the events in Benghazi marching and saying America is our friend. We stand with them.",2012-10-22,Democrat
Obama,"Now that represents the opportunity we have to take advantage of. And, you know, Governor Romney, Im glad that you agree that we have been successful in going after Al Qaida, but I have to tell you that, you know, your strategy previously has been one that has been all over the map and is not designed to keep Americans safe or to build on the opportunities that exist in the Middle East.",2012-10-22,Democrat
Romney,"Well, my strategy is pretty straightforward, which is to go after the bad guys, to make sure we do our very best to interrupt them, to  to kill them, to take them out of the picture. But my strategy is broader than that. Thats  thats important, of course. But the key that were going to have to pursue is a  is a pathway to get the Muslim world to be able to reject extremism on its own. We dont want another Iraq, we dont want another Afghanistan. Thats not the right course for us. The right course for us is to make sure that we go after the  the people who are leaders of these various anti-American groups and these  these jihadists, but also help the Muslim world. One, more economic development. We should key our foreign aid, our direct foreign investment, and that of our friends, we should coordinate it to make sure that we  we push back and give them more economic development. Number two, better education. Number three, gender equality. Number four, the rule of law. We have to help these nations create civil societies. But whats been happening over the last couple of years is, as weve watched this tumult in the Middle East, this rising tide of chaos occur, you see Al Qaida rushing in, you see other jihadist groups rushing in. And  and theyre throughout many nations in the Middle East.",2012-10-22,Republican
Romney,"Its wonderful that Libya seems to be making some progress, despite this terrible tragedy. But next door, of course, we have Egypt. Libyas 6 million population; Egypt, 80 million population. We want  we want to make sure that were seeing progress throughout the Middle East. With Mali now having North Mali taken over by Al Qaida; with Syria having Assad continuing to  to kill, to murder his own people, this is a region in tumult.

Obama,"Governor Romney, Im glad that you recognize that Al Qaida is a threat, because a few months ago when you were asked whats the biggest geopolitical threat facing America, you said Russia, not Al Qaida; you said Russia, in the 1980s, theyre now calling to ask for their foreign policy back because, you know, the Cold Wars been over for 20 years. But Governor, when it comes to our foreign policy, you seem to want to import the foreign policies of the 1980s, just like the social policies of the 1950s and the economic policies of the 1920s. You say that youre not interested in duplicating what happened in Iraq. But just a few weeks ago, you said you think we should have more troops in Iraq right now. And the  the challenge we have  I know you havent been in a position to actually execute foreign policy  but every time youve offered an opinion, youve been wrong. You said we should have gone into Iraq, despite that fact that there were no weapons of mass destruction. You said that we should still have troops in Iraq to this day. You indicated that we shouldnt be passing nuclear treaties with Russia despite the fact that 71 senators, Democrats and Republicans, voted for it. You said that, first, we should not have a timeline in Afghanistan. Then you said we should. Now you say maybe or it depends, which means not only were you wrong, but you were also confusing in sending mixed messages both to our troops and our allies.",2012-10-22,Democrat
Obama,"So, what  what we need to do with respect to the Middle East is strong, steady leadership, not wrong and reckless leadership that is all over the map. And unfortunately, thats the kind of opinions that youve offered throughout this campaign, and it is not a recipe for American strength, or keeping America safe over the long haul.",2012-10-22,Democrat

But  but I can say this, that were talking about the Middle East and how to help the Middle East reject the kind of terrorism were seeing, and the rising tide of tumult and  and confusion. And  and attacking me is not an agenda. Attacking me is not talking about how were going to deal with the challenges that exist in the Middle East, and take advantage of the opportunity there, and stem the tide of this violence.",2012-10-22,Republican

Russia does continue to battle us in the U.N. time and time again. I have clear eyes on this. Im not going to wear rose-colored glasses when it comes to Russia, or Mr. Putin. And Im certainly not going to say to him, Ill give you more flexibility after the election. After the election, hell get more backbone.

Obama,heres one thing Ive learned as commander in chief.,2012-10-22,Democrat
Schieffer,Let him answer,2012-10-22,Moderator
Obama,"Youve got to be clear, both to our allies and our enemies, about where you stand and what you mean. You just gave a speech a few weeks ago in which you said we should still have troops in Iraq. That is not a recipe for making sure that we are taking advantage of the opportunities and meeting the challenges of the Middle East. Now, it is absolutely true that we cannot just meet these challenges militarily. And so what Ive done throughout my presidency and will continue to do is, number one, make sure that these countries are supporting our counterterrorism efforts. Number two, make sure that they are standing by our interests in Israels security, because it is a true friend and our greatest ally in the region. Number three, we do have to make sure that were protecting religious minorities and women because these countries cant develop unless all the population, not just half of it, is developing. Number four, we do have to develop their economic  their economic capabilities. But number five, the other thing that we have to do is recognize that we cant continue to do nation building in these regions. Part of American leadership is making sure that were doing nation building here at home. That will help us maintain the kind of American leadership that we need.",2012-10-22,Democrat
Schieffer,"Let me interject the second topic question in this segment about the Middle East and so on, and that is, you both mentioned  alluded to this, and that is Syria. The war in Syria has now spilled over into Lebanon. We have, what, more than 100 people that were killed there in a bomb. There were demonstrations there, eight people dead. Mr. President, its been more than a year since you saw  you told Assad he had to go. Since then, 30,000 Syrians have died. Weve had 300,000 refugees. And you go first, sir.",2012-10-22,Moderator
Obama,"What weve done is organize the international community, saying Assad has to go. Weve mobilized sanctions against that government. We have made sure that they are isolated. We have provided humanitarian assistance and we are helping the opposition organize, and were particularly interested in making sure that were mobilizing the moderate forces inside of Syria. But ultimately, Syrians are going to have to determine their own future. And so everything were doing, were doing in consultation with our partners in the region, including Israel which obviously has a huge interest in seeing what happens in Syria; coordinating with Turkey and other countries in the region that have a great interest in this. This  what were seeing taking place in Syria is heartbreaking, and thats why we are going to do everything we can to make sure that we are helping the opposition. But we also have to recognize that, you know, for us to get more entangled militarily in Syria is a serious step, and we have to do so making absolutely certain that we know who we are helping; that were not putting arms in the hands of folks who eventually could turn them against us or allies in the region.",2012-10-22,Democrat
Romney,"Well, lets step back and talk about whats happening in Syria and how important it is. First of all, 30,000 people being killed by their government is a humanitarian disaster. Secondly, Syria is an opportunity for us because Syria plays an important role in the Middle East, particularly right now.",2012-10-22,Republican
Romney,"Syria is Irans only ally in the Arab world. Its their route to the sea. Its the route for them to arm Hezbollah in Lebanon, which threatens, of course, our ally, Israel. And so seeing Syria remove Assad is a very high priority for us. Number two, seeing a  a replacement government being responsible people is critical for us. And finally, we dont want to have military involvement there. We dont want to get drawn into a military conflict. And so the right course for us, is working through our partners and with our own resources, to identify responsible parties within Syria, organize them, bring them together in a  in a form of  if not government, a form of  of  of council that can take the lead in Syria. And then make sure they have the arms necessary to defend themselves. We do need to make sure that they dont have arms that get into the  the wrong hands. Those arms could be used to hurt us down the road. We need to make sure as well that we coordinate this effort with our allies, and particularly with  with Israel. But the Saudis and the Qatari, and  and the Turks are all very concerned about this. Theyre willing to work with us. We need to have a very effective leadership effort in Syria, making sure that the  the insurgent there are armed and that the insurgents that become armed, are people who will be the responsible parties. Recognize  I believe that Assad must go. I believe he will go. But I believe  we want to make sure that we have the relationships of friendship with the people that take his place, steps that in the years to come we see Syria as a  as a friend, and Syria as a responsible party in the Middle East. This  this is a critical opportunity for America. And what Im afraid of is weve watched over the past year or so, first the president saying, well well let the U.N. deal with it. And Assad  excuse me, Kofi Annan came in and said were going to try to have a ceasefire. That didnt work. Then it went to the Russians and said, lets see if you can do something. We should be playing the leadership role there, not on the ground with military.",2012-10-22,Republican
Schieffer,All right.,2012-10-22,Moderator
Romney,by the leadership role.,2012-10-22,Republican
Obama,"We are playing the leadership role. We organized the Friends of Syria. We are mobilizing humanitarian support, and support for the opposition. And we are making sure that those we help are those who will be friends of ours in the long term and friends of our allies in the region over the long term. But going back to Libya  because this is an example of how we make choices. When we went in to Libya, and we were able to immediately stop the massacre there, because of the unique circumstances and the coalition that we had helped to organize. We also had to make sure that Moammar Gadhafi didnt stay there. And to the governors credit, you supported us going into Libya and the coalition that we organized. But when it came time to making sure that Gadhafi did not stay in power, that he was captured, Governor, your suggestion was that this was mission creep, that this was mission muddle. Imagine if we had pulled out at that point. You know, Moammar Gadhafi had more American blood on his hands than any individual other than Osama bin Laden. And so we were going to make sure that we finished the job. Thats part of the reason why the Libyans stand with us. But we did so in a careful, thoughtful way, making certain that we knew who we were dealing with, that those forces of moderation on the ground were ones that we could work with, and we have to take the same kind of steady, thoughtful leadership when it comes to Syria. Thats exactly what were doing.",2012-10-22,Democrat

Romney,"I dont want to have our military involved in Syria. I dont think there is a necessity to put our military in Syria at this stage. I dont anticipate that in the future. As I indicated, our objectives are to replace Assad and to have in place a new government which is friendly to us, a responsible government, if possible. And I want to make sure they get armed and they have the arms necessary to defend themselves, but also to remove  to remove Assad. But I do not want to see a military involvement on the part of our  of our troops.",2012-10-22,Republican
Schieffer,Well,2012-10-22,Moderator

But look, this has been going on for a year. This is a time  this should have been a time for American leadership. We should have taken a leading role, not militarily, but a leading role organizationally, governmentally to bring together the parties; to find responsible parties. As you hear from intelligence sources even today, the  the insurgents are highly disparate. They havent come together. They havent formed a unity group, a council of some kind. That needs to happen. America can help that happen. And we need to make sure they have the arms they need to carry out the very important role which is getting rid of Assad.",2012-10-22,Republican

Obama,"Well, Ill  Ill be very quick. What you just heard Governor Romney said is he doesnt have different ideas. And thats because were doing exactly what we should be doing to try to promote a moderate Syrian leadership and a  an effective transition so that we get Assad out. Thats the kind of leadership weve shown. Thats the kind of leadership well continue to show.",2012-10-22,Democrat
Schieffer,"May I ask you, you know, during the Egyptian turmoil, there came a point when you said it was time for President Mubarak to go.",2012-10-22,Moderator
Obama,Right.,2012-10-22,Democrat
Schieffer,Some in your administration thought perhaps we should have waited a while on that. Do you have any regrets about that?,2012-10-22,Moderator
Obama,"No, I dont, because I think that America has to stand with democracy. The notion that we would have tanks run over those young people who were in Tahrir Square, that is not the kind of American leadership that John F. Kennedy talked about 50 years ago. But what Ive also said is that now that you have a democratically elected government in Egypt, that they have to make sure that they take responsibility for protecting religious minorities. And we have put significant pressure on them to make sure theyre doing that; to recognize the rights of women, which is critical throughout the region. These countries cant develop if young women are not given the kind of education that they need. They have to abide by their treaty with Israel. That is a red line for us, because not only is Israels security at stake, but our security is at stake if that unravels. They have to make sure that theyre cooperating with us when it comes to counterterrorism. And we will help them with respect to developing their own economy, because ultimately whats going to make the Egyptian revolution successful for the people of Egypt, but also for the world, is if those young people who gathered there are seeing opportunities. Their aspirations are similar to young peoples here. They want jobs, they want to be able to make sure their kids are going to a good school. They want to make sure that they have a roof over their heads and that they have the prospects of a better life in the future. And so one of the things that weve been doing is, is, for example, organizing entrepreneurship conferences with these Egyptians to give them a sense of how they can start rebuilding their economy in a way thats noncorrupt, thats transparent. But what is also important for us to understand is, is that for America to be successful in this region theres some things that were going to have to do here at home as well.",2012-10-22,Democrat
Schieffer,"Governor Romney, I want to hear your response to that, but I would just ask you, would you have stuck with Mubarak?",2012-10-22,Moderator
Romney,"No. I believe, as the president indicated, and said at the time that I supported his  his action there. I felt that  I wish wed have had a better vision of the future. I wish that, looking back at the beginning of the presidents term and even further back than that, that wed have recognized that there was a growing energy and passion for freedom in that part of the world, and that we would have worked more aggressively with our friend and with other friends in the region to have them make the transition towards a more representative form of government, such that it didnt explode in the way that it did. But once it exploded, I felt the same as the president did, which is these freedom voices and the streets of Egypt, where the people who were speaking of our principles and the President Mubarak had done things which were unimaginable and the idea of him crushing his people was not something that we could possibly support. Let me step back and talk about what I think our mission has to be in the Middle East and even more broadly, because our purpose is to make sure the world is more  is peaceful. We want a peaceful planet. We want people to be able to enjoy their lives and know theyre going to have a bright and prosperous future, not be at war. Thats our purpose. And the mantle of leadership for the  promoting the principles of peace has fallen to America. We didnt ask for it. But its an honor that we have it. But for us to be able to promote those principles of peace requires us to be strong. And that begins with a strong economy here at home. Unfortunately, the economy is not stronger. When the  when the president of Iraq  excuse me, of Iran, Ahmadinejad, says that our debt makes us not a great country, thats a frightening thing. Former chief of the  Joint Chiefs of Staff said that  Admiral Mullen said that our debt is the biggest national security threat we face. This  we have weakened our economy. We need a strong economy. We need to have as well a strong military. Our military is second to none in the world. Were blessed with terrific soldiers, and extraordinary technology and intelligence. But the idea of a trillion dollar in cuts through sequestration and budget cuts to the military would change that. We need to have strong allies. Our association and connection with our allies is essential to Americas strength. Were the great nation that has allies, 42 allies and friends around the world.",2012-10-22,Republican
Romney,"And, finally, we have to stand by our principles. And if were strong in each of those things, American influence will grow. But unfortunately, in nowhere in the world is Americas influence will grow. But unfortunately, in  nowhere in the world is Americas influence greater today than it was four years ago.",2012-10-22,Republican
Schieffer,All right.,2012-10-22,Moderator
Romney,And thats because weve become weaker in each of those four,2012-10-22,Republican
Schieffer,"youre going to get a chance to respond to that, because thats a perfect segue into our next segment, and that is, what is Americas role in the world? And that is the question. What do each of you see as our role in the world, and I believe, Governor Romney, its your chance to go first.",2012-10-22,Moderator
Romney,"Well I  I absolutely believe that America has a  a responsibility, and the privilege of helping defend freedom and promote the principles that  that make the world more peaceful. And those principles include human rights, human dignity, free enterprise, freedom of expression, elections. Because when there are elections, people tend to vote for peace. They dont vote for war. So we want to promote those principles around the world. We recognize that there are places of conflict in the world. We want to end those conflicts to the extent humanly possible. But in order to be able to fulfill our role in the world, America must be strong. America must lead. And for that to happen, we have to strengthen our economy here at home. You cant have 23 million people struggling to get a job. You cant have an economy that over the last three years keeps slowing down its growth rate. You cant have kids coming out of college, half of them cant find a job today, or a job thats commensurate with their college degree. We have to get our economy going. And our military, weve got to strengthen our military long-term. We dont know what the world is going to throw at us down the road. We  we make decisions today in the military that  that will confront challenges we cant imagine. In the 2000 debates, there was no mention of terrorism, for instance. And a year later, 9/11 happened. So, we have to make decisions based upon uncertainty, and that means a strong military. I will not cut our military budget. We have to also stand by our allies. I  I think the tension that existed between Israel and the United States was very unfortunate. I think also that pulling our missile defense program out of Poland in the way we did was also unfortunate in terms of, if you will, disrupting the relationship in some ways that existed between us. And then, of course, with regards to standing for our principles, when  when the students took to the streets in Tehran and the people there protested, the Green Revolution occurred, for the president to be silent I thought was an enormous mistake. We have to stand for our principles, stand for our allies, stand for a strong military and stand for a stronger economy.",2012-10-22,Republican
Schieffer,Mr. President?,2012-10-22,Moderator
Obama,"America remains the one indispensable nation. And the world needs a strong America, and it is stronger now than when I came into office. Because we ended the war in Iraq, we were able to refocus our attention on not only the terrorist threat, but also beginning a transition process in Afghanistan. It also allowed us to refocus on alliances and relationships that had been neglected for a decade. And Governor Romney, our alliances have never been stronger, in Asia, in Europe, in Africa, with Israel, where we have unprecedented military and intelligence cooperation, including dealing with the Iranian threat. But what we also have been able to do is position ourselves so we can start rebuilding America, and thats what my plan does. Making sure that were bringing manufacturing back to our shores so that were creating jobs here, as weve done with the auto industry, not rewarding companies that are shipping jobs overseas. Making sure that weve got the best education system in the world, including retraining our workers for the jobs of tomorrow. Doing everything we can to control our own energy. Weve cut our oil imports to the lowest level in two decades because weve developed oil and natural gas. But we also have to develop clean energy technologies that will allow us to cut our exports in half by 2020. Thats the kind of leadership that we need to show. And weve got to make sure that we reduce our deficit. Unfortunately, Governor Romneys plan doesnt do it. Weve got to do it in a responsible way by cutting out spending we dont need, but also asking the wealthiest to pay a little bit more. That way we can invest in the research and technology thats always kept us at the cutting edge. Now, Governor Romney has taken a different approach throughout this campaign. Both at home and abroad, he has proposed wrong and reckless policies. Hes praised George Bush as a good economic steward and Dick Cheney as somebody whos  who shows great wisdom and judgment. And taking us back to those kinds of strategies that got us into this mess are not the way that we are going to maintain leadership in the 21st century.",2012-10-22,Democrat
Schieffer,"Governor Romney, wrong and reckless policies?",2012-10-22,Moderator
Romney,"Ive got a policy for the future and agenda for the future. And when it comes to our economy here at home, I know what it takes to create 12 million new jobs and rising take-home pay. And what weve seen over the last four years is something I dont want to see over the next four years. The president said by now wed be a 5.4 percent unemployment. Were 9 million jobs short of that. I will get America working again and see rising take-home pay again, and Ill do it with five simple steps. Number one, we are going to have North American energy independence. Were going to do it by taking full advantage of oil, coal, gas, nuclear and our renewables. Number two, were going to increase our trade. Trade grows about 12 percent year. It doubles about every  every five or so years. We can do better than that, particularly in Latin America. The opportunities for us in Latin America we have just not taken advantage of fully. As a matter of fact, Latin Americas economy is almost as big as the economy of China. Were all focused on China. Latin America is a huge opportunity for us  time zone, language opportunities. Number three, were going to have to have training programs that work for our workers and schools that finally put the parents and the teachers and the kids first, and the teachers unions going to have to go behind. And then were going to have to get to a balanced budget. We cant expect entrepreneurs and businesses large and small to take their life savings or their companys money and invest in America if they think were headed to the road to Greece. And thats where were going right now unless we finally get off this spending and borrowing binge. And Ill get us on track to a balanced budget. And finally, number five, weve got to champion small business. Small business is where jobs come from. Two-thirds of our jobs come from small businesses. New business formation is down to the lowest level in 30 years under this administration. I want to bring it back and get back good jobs and rising take-home pay.",2012-10-22,Republican
Obama,"Well, lets talk about what we need to compete. First of all, Governor Romney talks about small businesses. But, Governor, when you were in Massachusetts, small businesses development ranked about 48th, I think out of 50 states in Massachusetts, because the policies that you are promoting actually dont help small businesses. And the way you define small businesses includes folks at the very top. And they include you and me. Thats not the kind of small business promotion we need. But lets take an example that we know is going to make a difference in the 21st century and thats our education policy. We didnt have a lot of chance to talk about this in the last debate. You know, under my leadership, what weve done is reformed education, working with governors, 46 states. Weve seen progress and gains in schools that were having a terrible time. And theyre starting to finally make progress. And what I now want to do is to hire more teachers, especially in math and science, because we know that weve fallen behind when it comes to math and science. And those teachers can make a difference. Now, Governor Romney, when you were asked by teachers whether or not this would help the economy grow, you said this isnt going to help the economy grow.",2012-10-22,Democrat
Obama,"When you were asked about reduced class sizes, you said class sizes dont make a difference. But I tell you, if you talk to teachers, they will tell you it does make a difference. And if weve got math teachers who are able to provide the kind of support that they need for our kids, thats whats going to determine whether or not the new businesses are created here. Companies are going to locate here depending on whether weve got the most highly skilled workforce. And the kinds of budget proposals that youve put forward, when we dont ask either you or me to pay a dime more in terms of reducing the deficit, but instead we slash support for education, thats undermining our long-term competitiveness.

We do it by getting  by reducing spending in a whole series of programs. By the way, number one I get rid of is Obamacare. There are a number of things that sound good, but frankly, we just cant afford them. And that one doesnt sound good and its not affordable. So Id get rid of that one from day one. To the extent humanly possible, we get that out. We take program after program that we dont absolutely have to have, and we get rid of them. Number two, we take some programs that we are doing to keep, like Medicaid, which is a program for the poor; well take that healthcare program for the poor and we give it to the states to run because states run these programs more efficiently. As a governor, I thought please, give me this program. I can run this more efficiently than the federal government and states, by the way, are proving it. States like Arizona, Rhode Island have taken these  these Medicaid dollars; have shown they can run these programs more cost-effectively. I want to do those two things and get this  get this to a balanced budget with eight  eight to 10 years. But the military  lets get back to the military, though.",2012-10-22,Republican
Obama,He should have answered the first question.,2012-10-22,Democrat
Obama,"Look, Governor Romneys called for $5 trillion of tax cuts that he says hes going to pay for by closing deductions. Now, the math doesnt work, but he continues to claim that hes going to do it. He then wants to spend another $2 trillion on military spending that our military is not asking for. And thats the budget that weve put forward. But, what you cant do is spend $2 trillion in additional military spending that the military is not asking for, $5 trillion on tax cuts. You say that youre going to pay for it by closing loopholes and deductions, without naming what those loopholes and deductions are. And then somehow youre also going to deal with the deficit that weve already got. The math simply doesnt work. But when it comes to our military, what we have to think about is not, you know just budgets, weve got to think about capabilities. We need to be thinking about cyber security. We need to be talking about space. Thats exactly what our budget does, but its driven by strategy. Its not driven by politics. Its not driven by members of Congress, and what they would like to see. Its driven by, what are we going to need to keep the American people safe? Thats exactly what our budget does, and it also then allows us to reduce our deficit, which is a significant national security concern. Because weve got to make sure that our economy is strong at home so that we can project military power overseas.",2012-10-22,Democrat
Romney,"Im pleased that Ive balanced budgets. I was on the world of business for 25 years. If you didnt balance your budget, you went out of business. I went into the Olympics that was out of balance, and we got it on balance, and made a success there. I had the chance to be governor of a state. Four years in a row, Democrats and Republicans came together to balance the budget. We cut taxes 19 times and balanced our budget. The president hasnt balanced a budget yet. I expect to have the opportunity to do so myself.",2012-10-22,Republican

Romney,"Our Navy is old  excuse me, our Navy is smaller now than at any time since 1917. The Navy said they needed 313 ships to carry out their mission. Were now at under 285. Were headed down to the low 200s if we go through a sequestration. Thats unacceptable to me. I want to make sure that we have the ships that are required by our Navy. Our Air Force is older and smaller than at any time since it was founded in 1947. Weve changed for the first time since FDR  since FDR we had the  weve always had the strategy of saying we could fight in two conflicts at once. Now were changing to one conflict. Look, this, in my view, is the highest responsibility of the President of the United States, which is to maintain the safety of the American people. And I will not cut our military budget by a trillion dollars, which is a combination of the budget cuts the president has, as well as the sequestration cuts. That, in my view, is making  is making our future less certain and less secure.",2012-10-22,Republican
Obama,"Bob, I just need to comment on this. First of all, the sequester is not something that Ive proposed. It is something that Congress has proposed. It will not happen. The budget that we are talking about is not reducing our military spending. It is maintaining it. But I think Governor Romney maybe hasnt spent enough time looking at how our military works. You mentioned the Navy, for example, and that we have fewer ships than we did in 1916. Well, Governor, we also have fewer horses and bayonets, because the nature of our militarys changed. We have these things called aircraft carriers, where planes land on them. We have these ships that go underwater, nuclear submarines.",2012-10-22,Democrat
Obama,"And so the question is not a game of Battleship, where were counting slips. Its what are our capabilities. And so when I sit down with the Secretary of the Navy and the Joint Chiefs of Staff, we determine how are we going to be best able to meet all of our defense needs in a way that also keeps faith with our troops, that also makes sure that our veterans have the kind of support that they need when they come home.",2012-10-22,Democrat

Schieffer,"A lot to cover. Id like  Id like to move to the next segment: red lines, Israel and Iran. Would either of you  and youll have two minutes  and, President Obama, you have the first go at this one  would either of you be willing to declare that an attack on Israel is an attack on the United States, which, of course, is the same promise that we give to our close allies like Japan. And if you made such a declaration, would not that deter Iran? Its certainly deterred the Soviet Union for a long, long time when we made that  we made  we made that promise to our allies.",2012-10-22,Moderator
Obama,"First of all, Israel is a true friend. It is our greatest ally in the region. And if Israel is attacked, America will stand with Israel. Ive made that clear throughout my presidency. And",2012-10-22,Democrat
Schieffer,So youre  youre saying weve already made that declaration.,2012-10-22,Moderator
Obama,"I will stand with Israel if they are attacked. And this is the reason why, working with Israel, we have created the strongest military and intelligence cooperation between our two countries in history. In fact, this week well be carrying out the largest military exercise with Israel in history, this very week. But to the issue of Iran, as long as Im president of the United States Iran will not get a nuclear weapon. I made that clear when I came into office.",2012-10-22,Democrat
Obama,"We then organized the strongest coalition and the strongest sanctions against Iran in history, and it is crippling their economy. Their currency has dropped 80 percent. Their oil production has plunged to the lowest level since they were fighting a war with Iraq 20 years ago. So their economy is in a shambles. And the reason we did this is because a nuclear Iran is a threat to our national security, and it is a threat to Israels national security. We cannot afford to have a nuclear arms race in the most volatile region of the world. Iran is a state sponsor of terrorism. And for them to be able to provide nuclear technology to non-state actors, thats unacceptable. And they have said that they want to see Israel wiped off the map. So the work that weve done with respect to sanctions now offers Iran a choice. They can take the diplomatic route and end their nuclear program or they will have to face a united world and a United States president, me, who said were not going to take any options off the table. The disagreement I have with Governor Romney is that, during the course of this campaign, hes often talked as if we should take premature military action. I think that would be a mistake, because when Ive sent young men and women into harms way, I always understand that that is the last resort, not the first resort.",2012-10-22,Democrat
Schieffer,Two minutes.,2012-10-22,Moderator
Romney,"Well, first of all, I want to underscore the same point the president mad,e which is that if Im President of the United States, when Im President of the United States, we will stand with Israel. And if Israel is attacked, we have their back, not just diplomatically, not just culturally, but militarily. Thats number one. Number two, with regards to Iran and the threat of Iran, theres no question but that a nuclear Iran, a nuclear-capable Iran is unacceptable to America. It presents a threat not only to our friends but ultimately a threat to us to have Iran have nuclear material, nuclear weapons that could be used against us or used to be threatening to us.",2012-10-22,Republican
Romney,"It is also essential for us to understand what our mission is in Iran, and that is to dissuade Iran from having a nuclear weapon through peaceful and diplomatic means. And crippling sanctions are something I called for five years ago, when I was in Israel, speaking at the Herzliya Conference. I laid out seven steps, crippling sanctions were number one. And they do work. Youre seeing it right now in the economy. Its absolutely the right thing to do, to have crippling sanctions. I would have put them in place earlier. But its good that we have them. Number two, something I would add today is I would tighten those sanctions. I would say that ships that carry Iranian oil, cant come into our ports. I imagine the E.U. would agree with us as well. Not only ships couldnt, but Id say companies that are moving their oil cant, people who are trading in their oil cant. I would tighten those sanctions further. Secondly, Id take on diplomatic isolation efforts. Id make sure that Ahmadinejad is indicted under the Genocide Convention. His words amount to genocide incitation. I would indict him for it. I would also make sure that their diplomats are treated like the pariah they are around the world. The same way we treated the apartheid diplomats of South Africa. We need to increase pressure time, and time again on Iran because anything other than a  a  a solution to this, which says  which stops this  this nuclear folly of theirs, is unacceptable to America. And of course, a military action is the last resort. It is something one would only  only consider if all of the other avenues had been  had been tried to their full extent.",2012-10-22,Republican
Schieffer,"Let me ask both of you, there  as you know, there are reports that Iran and the United States a part of an international group, have agreed in principle to talks about Irans nuclear program. What is the deal, if there are such talks? What is the deal that you would accept, Mr. President?",2012-10-22,Moderator
Obama,"Well, first of all those are reports in the newspaper. They are not true. But our goal is to get Iran to recognize it needs to give up its nuclear program and abide by the U.N. resolutions that have been in place. Because they have the opportunity to reenter the community of nations, and we would welcome that. There  there are people in Iran who have the same aspirations as people all around the world for a better life. And we hope that their leadership takes the right decision, but the deal well accept is they end their nuclear program. Its very straightforward. And Im glad that Governor Romney agrees with the steps that were taking. You know, there have been times, Governor, frankly, during the course of this campaign, where it sounded like you thought that youd do the same things we did, but youd say them louder and somehow that  that would make a difference. And it turns out that the work involved in setting up these crippling sanctions is painstaking. Its meticulous. We started from the day we got into office. And the reason is was so important  and this is a testament to how weve restored American credibility and strength around the world  is we had to make sure that all the countries participated, even countries like Russia and China. Because if its just us that are imposing sanctions  weve had sanctions in place a long time. Its because we got everybody to agree that Iran is seeing so much pressure. And weve got to maintain that pressure. There is a deal to be had, and that is that they abide by the rules that have already been established. They convince the international community they are not pursuing a nuclear program. There are inspections that are very intrusive. But over time, what they can do is regain credibility. In the meantime, though, were not going to let up the pressure until we have clear evidence that that takes place. And one last thing  just  just to make this point. The clock is ticking. Were not going to allow Iran to perpetually engage in negotiations that lead nowhere. And Ive been very clear to them. You know, because of the intelligence coordination that we do with a range of countries, including Israel, we have a sense of when they would get breakout capacity, which means that we would not be able to intervene in time to stop their nuclear program. And that clock is ticking. And were going to make sure that if they do not meet the demands of the international community, then we are going to take all options necessary to make sure they dont have a nuclear weapon.",2012-10-22,Democrat
Schieffer,Governor?,2012-10-22,Moderator
Romney,"I think from the very beginning, one of the challenges weve had with Iran is that they have looked at this administration, and felt that the administration was not as strong as it needed to be. I think they saw weakness where they had expected to find American strength. And I say that because from the very beginning, the president in his campaign four years ago, said he would meet with all the worlds worst actors in his first year, hed sit down with Chavez and Kim Jong-il, with Castro and President Ahmadinejad of Iran. And I think they looked and thought, well, thats an unusual honor to receive from the President of the United States. And then the president began what I have called an apology tour, of going to various nations in the Middle East and criticizing America. I think they looked at that and saw weakness. Then when there were dissidents in the streets of Tehran, a Green Revolution, holding signs saying, is America with us, the president was silent. I think they noticed that as well. And I think that when the president said he was going to create daylight between ourselves and Israel, that they noticed that as well. All of these things suggested, I think, to the Iranian mullahs that, hey, you know, we can keep on pushing along here, we can keep talks going on, were just going to keep on spinning centrifuges. Now there are some 10,000 centrifuges spinning uranium, preparing to create a nuclear threat to the United States and to the world. Thats unacceptable for us, and its essential for a president to show strength from the very beginning, to make it very clear what is acceptable and not acceptable. And an Iranian nuclear program is not acceptable to us. They must not develop nuclear capability. And the way to make sure they understand that is by having, from the very beginning, the tightest sanctions possible. They need to be tightened. Our diplomatic isolation needs to be tougher. We need to indict Ahmadinejad. We need to put the pressure on them as hard as we possibly can, because if we do that, we wont have to take the military action.",2012-10-22,Republican
Obama,"Bob, let me just respond. Nothing Governor Romney just said is true, starting with this notion of me apologizing. This has been probably the biggest whopper thats been told during the course of this campaign. And every fact checker and every reporter whos looked at it, Governor, has said this is not true. And when it comes to tightening sanctions, look, as I said before, weve put in the toughest, most crippling sanctions ever. And the fact is, while we were coordinating an international coalition to make sure these sanctions were effective, you were still invested in a Chinese state oil company that was doing business with the Iranian oil sector. So Ill let the American people decide, judge, whos going to be more effective and more credible when it comes to imposing crippling sanctions. And with respect to our attitude about the Iranian revolution, I was very clear about the murderous activities that had taken place and that was contrary to international law and everything that civilized people stand for. And  and so the strength that we have shown in Iran is shown by the fact that weve been able to mobilize the world. When I came into office, the world was divided. Iran was resurgent. Iran is at its weakest point, economically, strategically, militarily, then since  then in many years. And we are going to continue to keep the pressure on to make sure that they do not get a nuclear weapon. Thats in Americas national interest and that will be the case so long as Im president.",2012-10-22,Democrat
Romney,"Were four years closer to a nuclear Iran. Were four years closer to a nuclear Iran. And  and  we should not have wasted these four years to the extent they  they continue to be able to spin these centrifuges and get that much closer. Thats number one. Number two, Mr. President, the reason I call it an apology tour is because you went to the Middle East and you flew to Egypt and to Saudi Arabia and to Turkey and Iraq. And by the way, you skipped Israel, our closest friend in the region, but you went to the other nations. And by the way, they noticed that you skipped Israel. And then in those nations, and on Arabic TV, you said that America had been dismissive and derisive. You said that on occasion America had dictated to other nations. Mr. President, America has not dictated to other nations. We have freed other nations from dictators.",2012-10-22,Republican
Obama,"Bob, let me  let me respond. If were going to talk about trips that weve taken  when I was a candidate for office, first trip I took was to visit our troops. And when I went to Israel as a candidate, I didnt take donors. I didnt attend fundraisers. I went to Yad Beshef (ph), the Holocaust museum there, to remind myself the nature of evil and why our bond with Israel will be unbreakable. And then I went down to the border towns of Storok (ph), which had experienced missiles raining dowm from Hamas. And I saw families there who showed me there where missiles had come down near their childrens bedrooms. And I was reminded of what that would mean if those were my kids. Which is why as president, we funded an Iron Dome program to stop those missiles.",2012-10-22,Democrat
Obama,"So thats how Ive used my travels, when I travel to Israel and when I travel to the region. And the  the central question at this point is going to be: Who is going to be credible to all parties involved? And they can look at my track record, whether its Iran sanctions, whether its dealing with counterterrorism, whether its supporting democracy, whether its supporting womens rights, whether its supporting religious minorities. And they can say that the President of the United States and the United States of America has stood on the right side of history.

I see jihadists continuing to spread, whether theyre rising or just about the same level, hard to precisely measure, but its clear theyre there. Theyre very strong. I see Syria with 30,000 civilians dead, Assad still in power. I see our trade deficit with China, larger than its  growing larger every year, as a matter of fact. I look around the world and I dont feel that you see North Korea, continuing to export their nuclear technology, Russia said theyre not going to follow Nunn-Lugar any more. Theyre back away from a nuclear proliferation treaty that we had with them.",2012-10-22,Republican

I mean, Im  Im pleased that you now are endorsing our policy of applying diplomatic pressure and potentially having bilateral discussions with the Iranians to end their nuclear program. But just a few years ago you said thats something youd never do. In the same way that you initially opposed a timetable in Afghanistan, now youre for it, although it depends. In the same way that you say you would have ended the war in Iraq, but recently gave a speech saying that we should have 20,000 more folks in there. The same way that you said that it was mission creep to go after Gadhafi. When it comes to going after Osama bin Laden, you said, well, any president would make that call. But when you were a candidate in 2008, as I was, and I said if I got bin Laden in our sights I would take that shot, you said we shouldnt move heaven and earth to get one man.",2012-10-22,Democrat
Obama,"And you said we should ask Pakistan for permission. And if we had asked Pakistan permission, we would not have gotten him. And it was worth moving heaven and earth to get him. You know, after we killed bin Laden I was at ground zero for a memorial and talked to a young women who was four years old when 9/11 happened. And the last conversation she had with her father was him calling from the twin towers, saying Peyton (ph), I love you and I will always watch over you. And for the next decade, she was haunted by that conversation. And she said to me, You know, by finally getting bin Laden, that brought some closure to me. And when we do things like that  when we bring those who have harmed us to justice, that sends a message to the world and it tells Peyton (ph) that we did not forget her father. And I make that point because thats the kind of clarity of leadership, and those decisions are not always popular. Those decisions generally  generally are not poll-tested. And even some in my own party, including my current vice president, had the same critique as you did. But what the American people understand is that I look at what we need to get done to keep the American people safe and to move our interests forward, and I make those decisions.",2012-10-22,Democrat

Schieffer,Well give you  well catch up.,2012-10-22,Moderator
Romney,"Well, were going to be finished by 2014, and when Im president, well make sure we bring our troops out by the end of 2014. The commanders and the generals there are on track to do so. Weve seen progress over the past several years. The surge has been successful and the training program is proceeding apace. There are now a large number of Afghan Security Forces, 350,000 that are ready to step in to provide security and were going to be able to make that transition by the end of 2014. So our troops will come home at that point. I can tell you at the same time, that we will make sure that we look at whats happening in Pakistan, and recognize that whats happening in Pakistan is going to have a major impact on the success in Afghanistan. And I say that because I know a lot of people that feel like we should just brush our hands and walk away. And I dont mean you, Mr. President, but some people in the  in our nation feel that Pakistan is being nice to us, and that we should walk away fro mthem. But Pakistan is important to the region, to the world and to us, because Pakistan has 100 nuclear warheads and theyre rushing to build a lot more. Theyll have more than Great Britain sometime in the  in the relatively near future. They also have the Haqqani Network and the Taliban existent within their country. And so a Pakistan that falls apart, becomes a failed state, would be of extraordinary danger to Afghanistan and to us. And so were going to have to remain helpful in encouraging Pakistan to move towards a more stable government and rebuild the relationship with us. And that means that our aid that we provide to Pakistan is going to have to be conditioned upon certain benchmarks being met.",2012-10-22,Republican

Obama,"When I came into office, we were still bogged down in Iraq and Afghanistan had been drifting for a decade. We ended the war in Iraq, refocused our attention on Afghanistan, and we did deliver a surge of troops. That was facilitated in part because we had ended the war in Iraq. And we are now in a position where we have met many of the objectives that got us there in the first place. Part of what had happened is wed forgotten why we had gone. We went because there were people who were responsible for 3,000 American deaths. And so we decimated Al Qaidas core leadership in the border regions between Afghanistan and Pakistan. We then started to build up Afghan forces. And were now in a position where we can transition out, because theres no reason why Americans should die when Afghans are perfectly capable of defending their own country. Now, that transition has to take place in a responsible fashion. Weve been there a long time, and weve got to make sure that we and our coalition partners are pulling out responsibly and giving Afghans the capabilities that they need. But what I think the American people recognize is after a decade of war its time to do some nation building here at home. And what we can now do is free up some resources, to, for example, put Americans back to work, especially our veterans, rebuilding our roads, our bridges, our schools, making sure that, you know, our veterans are getting the care that they need when it comes to post-traumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injury, making sure that the certifications that they need for good jobs of the future are in place.",2012-10-22,Democrat
Obama,"You know, I was having lunch with some  a veteran in Minnesota who had been a medic dealing with the most extreme circumstances. When he came home and he wanted to become a nurse, he had to start from scratch. And what weve said is lets change those certifications. The first lady has done great work with an organization called Joining Forces putting our veterans back to work. And as a consequence, veterans unemployment is actually now lower than general population. It was higher when I came into office. So those are the kinds of things that we can now do because were making that transition in Afghanistan.",2012-10-22,Democrat

General Allen, our commander in Afghanistan, says that Americans continue to die at the hands of groups who are supported by Pakistan.

It still provides safe haven for terrorists, yet we continue to give Pakistan billions of dollars.",2012-10-22,Moderator
Romney,"No, its not time to divorce a nation on Earth that has 100 nuclear weapons and is on the way to double that at some point, a nation that has serious threats from terrorist groups within its nation, as I indicated before, the Taliban, Haqqani Network. Its a nation thats not like  like others and it does not have a civilian leadership that is calling the shots there. You have the ISI, their intelligence organization, is probably the most powerful of the  of three branches there. Then you have the military and then you have the civilian government. This is a nation, which, if it falls apart, if it  if it becomes a failed state, there are nuclear weapons there and youve got  youve got terrorists there who could grab their  their hands onto those nuclear weapons.",2012-10-22,Republican
Romney,"This is  this is an important part of the world for us. Pakistan is  is technically an ally, and theyre not acting very much like an ally right now. But we have some work to do. And I  I dont blame the administration for the fact that the relationship with Pakistan is strained. We  we had to go into Pakistan. We had to go in there to get Osama bin Laden. That was the right thing to do. And  and that upset them, but obviously there was a great deal of anger even before that. But were going to have to work with the  with the people in Pakistan to try and help them move to a more responsible course than the one that theyre on. And its important for them. Its important for the nuclear weapons. Its important for the success of Afghanistan. Because inside Pakistan, you have a  a large group of Pashtun that are  that are Taliban. Theyre going to come rushing back in to Afghanistan when we go. And thats one of the reasons the Afghan Security Forces have so much work to do to be able to fight against that. But its important for us to recognize that we cant just walk away from Pakistan.

And its widely reported that drones are being used in drone strikes, and I support that and entirely, and feel the president was right to up the usage of that technology, and believe that we should continue to use it, to continue to go after the people that represent a threat to this nation and to our friends.

Is the Middle East in tumult? Yes. Is  is al-Qaida on the run, on its heels? No. Is  are Israel and the Palestinians closer to reaching a peace agreement? No, they havent had talks in two years. We have not seen the progress we need to have, and Im convinced that with strong leadership and an effort to build a strategy based upon helping these nations reject extremism, we can see the kind of peace and prosperity the world demands.",2012-10-22,Republican
Obama,"Well, keep in mind our strategy wasnt just going after bin Laden. We created partnerships throughout the region to deal with extremism in Somalia, in Yemen, in Pakistan. And what weve also done is engaged these governments in the kind of reforms that are actually going to make a difference in peoples lives day to day, to make sure that their governments arent corrupt, to make sure that theyre treating women with the kind of respect and dignity that every nation that succeeds has shown and to make sure that theyve got a free market system that works. So across the board, we are engaging them in building capacity in these countries. And we have stood on the side of democracy. One thing I think Americans should be proud of, when Tunisians began to protest, this nation  me, my administration  stood with them earlier than just about any country. In Egypt we stood on the side of democracy. In Libya we stood on the side of the people. And as a consequence, theres no doubt that attitudes about Americans have changed. But there are always going to be elements in these countries that potentially threaten the United States. And we want to shrink those groups and those networks and we can do that.",2012-10-22,Democrat
Obama,"But were always also going to have to maintain vigilance when it comes to terrorist activities. The truth, though, is that Al Qaeda is much weaker than it was when I came into office. And they dont have the same capacities to attack the U.S. homeland and our allies as they did four years ago.",2012-10-22,Democrat
Schieffer,"Lets  lets go to the next segment, because its a very important one. It is the rise of China and future challenges for America. I want to just begin this by asking both of you, and Mr. President, you  you go first this time.",2012-10-22,Moderator
Obama,"Well, I think it will continue to be terrorist networks. We have to remain vigilant, as I just said. But with respect to China, China is both an adversary, but also a potential partner in the international community if its following the rules. So my attitude coming into office was that we are going to insist that China plays by the same rules as everybody else. I know Americans had seen jobs being shipped overseas; businesses and workers not getting a level playing field when it came to trade. And thats the reason why I set up a trade task force to go after cheaters when it came to international trade. Thats the reason why we have brought more cases against China for violating trade rules than the other  the previous administration had done in two terms. And weve won just about every case that weve filed, that has been decided.",2012-10-22,Democrat
Obama,"In fact, just recently steelworkers in Ohio and throughout the Midwest  Pennsylvania  are in a position now to sell steel to China because we won that case. We had a tire case in which they were flooding us with cheap domestic tires  or  or cheap Chinese tires. And we put a stop to it and as a consequence saved jobs throughout America. I have to say that Governor Romney criticized me for being too tough in that tire case; said this wouldnt be good for American workers and that it would be protectionist. But I tell you, those workers dont feel that way. They feel as if they had finally an administration who was going to take this issue seriously. Over the long term, in order for us to compete with China, weve also got to make sure, though, that were taking  taking care of business here at home. If we dont have the best education system in the world, if we dont continue to put money into research and technology that will allow us to create great businesses here in the United States, thats how we lose the competition. And, unfortunately, Governor Romneys budget and his proposals would not allow us to make those investments.",2012-10-22,Democrat
Schieffer,All right.,2012-10-22,Moderator
Romney,"Well, first of all, its not government that makes business successful. Its not government investments that makes businesses grow and hire people. Let me also note that the greatest threat that the world faces, the greatest national security threat is a nuclear Iran. Lets talk about China. China has an interest thats very much like ours in one respect, and that is they want a stable world. They dont want war. They dont want to see protectionism. They dont want to see the world break out into  into various forms of chaos, because they have to  they have to manufacture goods and put people to work and they have about 20,000  20 million, rather, people coming out of the farms every year coming into the cities, needing jobs. So they want the economy to work and the world to be free and open. And so we can be a partner with China. We dont have to be an adversary in any way, shape or form. We can work with them, we can collaborate with them, if theyre willing to be responsible. Now, they look at us and say, Is it a good idea to be with America? How strong are we going to be? How strong is our economy? They look at the fact that we owe em a trillion dollars and owe other people $16 trillion in total, including that.",2012-10-22,Republican
Romney,"They look at our  our decision to  to cut back on our military capabilities. A trillion dollars. The secretary of defense called these trillion dollars of cuts to our military devastating. Its not my term, its the presidents own secretary of defense called these trillion dollars of cuts to our military devastating. Its not my term, its the presidents own Secretary of Defense, called them devastating. They look at Americas commitments around the world and they see whats happening, and they say, well, OK. Is America going to be strong? And the answer is, yes, if Im president, America will be very strong. Well also make sure that we have trade relations with China that work for us. Ive watched year in and year out as companies have shut down and people have lost their jobs because China has not played by the same rules, in part by holding down artificially the value of their currency. It holds down the prices of their goods. It means our goods arent as competitive and we lose jobs. Thats got to end. Theyre making some progress; they need to make more. Thats why on day one, i will label them a currency manipulator, which allows us to apply tariffs where theyre taking jobs. Theyre stealing our intellectual property, our patents, our designs, our technology, hacking into our computers, counterfeiting our goods. They have to understand we want to trade with them. We want a world thats stable. We like free enterprise, but you got to play by the rules.",2012-10-22,Republican
Schieffer,"Well, Governor, let me just ask you. If you declare them a currency manipulator on day one, some people are  say youre just going to start a trade war with China on day one. Is that  isnt there a risk that that could happen?",2012-10-22,Moderator
Romney,"Well, they sell us about this much stuff every year, and we sell them about this much stuff every year. So its pretty clear who doesnt want a trade war. And theres one going on right now, which we dont know about it. Its a silent one. And theyre winning. We have enormous trade imbalance with China, and its worse this year than last year, and its worse last year than the year before. And so we have to understand that we cant just surrender and lose jobs year in and year out. We have to say to our friend in China, look, you guys are playing aggressively. We understand it. But this cant keep on going. You cant keep on holding down the value of your currency, stealing our intellectual property, counterfeiting our products, selling them around the world, even to the United States. I was with one company that makes valves and  and process industries and they said, look, we were  we were having some valves coming in that  that were broken and we had to repair them under warranty and we looked them and  and they had our serial number on them. And then we noticed that there was more than one with that same serial number. They were counterfeit products being made overseas with the same serial number as a U.S. company, the same packaging, these were being sold into our market and around the world as if they were made by the U.S. competitor. This cant go on. I want a great relationship with China. China can be our partner, but  but that doesnt mean they can just roll all over us and steal our jobs on an unfair basis.",2012-10-22,Republican
Obama,"Well, Governor Romneys right, you are familiar with jobs being shipped overseas because you invested in companies that were shipping jobs overseas. And, you know, thats  youre right. I mean thats how our free market works. But Ive made a different bet on American workers. If we had taken your advice Governor Romney about our auto industry, wed be buying cars from China instead of selling cars to China. If we take your advice with respect to how we change our tax codes so that companies that earn profits overseas dont pay U.S. taxes compared to companies here that are paying taxes. Now thats estimated to create 800,000 jobs, the problem is they wont be here, theyll be in places like China. And if were not making investments in education and basic research, which is not something that the private sector is doing at a sufficient pace right now and has never done, then we will lose the (inaudible) in things like clean energy technology. Now with respect to what weve done with China already, U.S. exports have doubled since I came into office, to China and actually currencies are at their most advantageous point for U.S. exporters since 1993. We absolutely have to make more progress and thats why were going to keep on pressing. And when it comes to our military and Chinese security, part of the reason that we were able to pivot to the Asia-Pacific region after having ended the war in Iraq and transitioning out of Afghanistan, is precisely because this is going to be a massive growth area in the future. And we believe China can be a partner, but were also sending a very clear signal that America is a Pacific power; that we are going to have a presence there. We are working with countries in the region to make sure, for example, that ships can pass through; that commerce continues. And were organizing trade relations with countries other than China so that China starts feeling more pressure about meeting basic international standards. Thats the kind of leadership weve shown in the region. Thats the kind of leadership that well continue to show.",2012-10-22,Democrat
Romney,"I just want to take one of those points, again, attacking me as not talking about an agenda for  for getting more trade and opening up more jobs in this country. But the president mentioned the auto industry and that somehow I would be in favor of jobs being elsewhere. Nothing could be further from the truth. Im a son of Detroit. I was born in Detroit. My dad was head of a car company. I like American cars. And I would do nothing to hurt the U.S. auto industry. My plan to get the industry on its feet when it was in real trouble was not to start writing checks. It was President Bush that wrote the first checks. I disagree with that. I said they need  these companies need to go through a managed bankruptcy. And in that process, they can get government help and government guarantees, but they need to go through bankruptcy to get rid of excess cost and the debt burden that theyd  theyd built up.",2012-10-22,Republican

Obama,People will look it up.,2012-10-22,Democrat
Romney,Good.,2012-10-22,Republican
Obama,"But more importantly it is true that in order for us to be competitive, were going to have to make some smart choices right now. Cutting our education budget, thats not a smart choice. That will not help us compete with China. Cutting our investments in research and technology, thats not a smart choice. That will not help us compete with China. Bringing down our deficit by adding $7 trillion of tax cuts and military spending that our military is not asking for, before we even get to the debt that we currently have, that is not going to make us more competitive. Those are the kinds of choices that the American people face right now. Having a tax code that rewards companies that are shipping jobs overseas instead of companies that are investing here in the United States, that will not make us more competitive. And the one thing that Im absolutely clear about is that after a decade in which we saw drift, jobs being shipped overseas, nobody championing American workers and American businesses, weve now begun to make some real progress. What we cant do is go back to the same policies that got us into such difficulty in the first place. Thats why we have to move forward and not go back.",2012-10-22,Democrat
Romney,"I couldnt agree more about going forward, but I certainly dont want to go back to the policies of the last four years. The policies of the last four years have seen incomes in America decline every year for middle income families, now down $4,300 during your term. Twenty-three million Americans still struggling to find a good job. When you came to office 32 million people on food stamps. Today, 47 million people on food stamps. When you came to office, just over $10 trillion in debt, now $16 trillion in debt. It hasnt worked. You said by now wed be at 5.4 percent unemployment. Were 9 million jobs short of that. Ive met some of those people. Ive met them in Appleton, Wisconsin. I met a young woman in  in Philadelphia whos coming out of  out of college, cant find work. Ive been  Ann was with someone just the other day that was just weeping about not being able to get work. Its just a tragedy in a nation so prosperous as ours, that the last four years have been so hard. And thats why its so critical, that we make America once again the most attractive place in the world to start businesses, to build jobs, to grow the economy. And thats not going to happen by just hiring teachers. Look, I love to  I love teachers, and Im happy to have states and communities that want to hire teachers do that. By the way, I dont like to have the federal government start pushing its weight deeper and deeper into our schools. Let the states and localities do that. I was a governor. The federal government didnt hire our teachers.",2012-10-22,Republican

Schieffer,"Gentlemen, thank you so much for a very vigorous debate. We have come to the end. It is time for closing statements, I believe youre first, Mr. President.",2012-10-22,Moderator
Obama,"Well, thank you very much, Bob, Governor Romney, and to Lynn University. Youve now heard three debates, months of campaigning and way too many TV commercials. And now youve got a choice. Over the last four years weve made real progress digging our way out of policies that gave us two prolonged wars, record deficits and the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. And Governor Romney wants to take us back to those policies, a foreign policy thats wrong and reckless, economic policies that wont create jobs, wont reduce our deficit, but will make sure that folks at the very top dont have to play by the same rules that you do. And Ive got a different vision for America. I want to build on our strengths. And Ive put forward a plan to make sure that were bringing manufacturing jobs back to our shores by rewarding companies and small businesses that are investing here, not overseas. I want to make sure weve got the best education system in the world. And were retaining our workers for the jobs of tomorrow. I want to control our own energy by developing oil and natural gas but also the energy sources of the future. Yes, I want to reduce our deficit by cutting spending that we dont need but also by asking the wealthy to do a little bit more so that we can invest in things like research and technology that are the key to a 21st century economy. As Commander in Chief, I will maintain the strongest military in the world, keep faith with our troops and go after those who would do us harm. but after a decade of war, I think we all recognize weve got to do some nation building here at home, rebuilding our roads, our bridges and especially caring for our Veterans who sacrificed so much for our freedom. And weve been through tough times but we always bounce back because of our character, because we pull together and if I have the privilege of being your president for another four years, I promise you I will always listen to your voices. I will fight for your families and I will work every single day to make sure that America continues to be the greatest nation on earth. Thank you.",2012-10-22,Democrat

Romney,"Thank you. Bob, Mr. President, folks at Lynn University, good to be with you. Im optimistic about the future. Im excited about our prospects as a nation. I want to see peace. I want to see growing peace in this country. Its our objective. We have an opportunity to have real leadership. Americas going to have that kind of leadership and continue to promote principles of peace to make a world a safer place and make people in this country more confident that their future is secure. I also want to make sure that we get this economy going. And there are two very different paths the country can take. One is a path represented by the president, which at the end of four years would mean wed have $20 trillion in debt heading towards Greece. Ill get us on track to a balanced budget. The presidents path will mean continuing declining in take-home pay. I want to make sure our take-home pay turns around and starts to grow. The presidents path will mean continuing declining in take-home pay. I want to make sure take-home pay turns around and starts to grow. The presidents path means 20 million people out of work struggling for a good job. Ill get people back to work with 12 million new jobs. Im going to make sure that we get people off of food stamps, not by cutting the program, but by getting them good jobs. Americas going to come back, and for that to happen, were going to have to have a president who can work across the aisle. I was in a state where my legislature was 87 percent Democrat. I learned how to get along on the other side of the aisle. Weve got to do that in Washington. Washington is broken. I know what it takes to get this country back, and will work with good Democrats and good Republicans to do that. This nation is the hope of the earth. Weve been blessed by having a nation thats free and prosperous thanks to the contributions of the greatest generation. Theyve held a torch for the world to see  the torch of freedom and hope and opportunity. Now, its our turn to take that torch. Im convinced well do it. We need strong leadership. Id like to be that leader with your support. Ill work with you. Ill lead you in an open and honest way, and I ask for your vote.

MUIR,"So let's get started. I want to begin tonight with the issue voters repeatedly say is their number one issue, and that is the economy and the cost of living in this country. Vice President Harris, you and President Trump [sic] were elected four years ago and your opponent on the stage here tonight often asks his supporters, are you better off than you were four years ago? When it comes to the economy, do you believe Americans are better off than they were four years ago?",2024-09-10,Moderator
HARRIS,"So, I was raised as a middle-class kid. And I am actually the only person on this stage who has a plan that is about lifting up the middle class and working people of America. I believe in the ambition, the aspirations, the dreams of the American people. And that is why I imagine and have actually a plan to build what I call an opportunity economy. Because here's the thing. We know that we have a, a shortage of homes and housing, and the cost of housing is too expensive for far too many people. We know that young families need support to raise their children. And I intend on extending a tax cut for those families of $6,000, which is the largest child tax credit that we have given in a long time. So that those young families can afford to buy a crib, buy a car seat, buy clothes for their children. My passion, one of them, is small businesses. I was actually--my mother raised my sister and me but there was a woman who helped raise us. We call her our second mother. She was a small business owner. I love our small businesses. My plan is to give a $50,000 tax deduction to start up small businesses, knowing they are part of the backbone of America's economy. My opponent, on the other hand, his plan is to do what he has done before, which is to provide a tax cut for billionaires and big corporations, which will result in $5 trillion to America's deficit. My opponent has a plan that I call the Trump sales tax, which would be a 20% tax on everyday goods that you rely on to get through the month. Economists have said that that Trump's sales tax would actually result for middle-class families in about $4,000 more a year because of his policies and his ideas about what should be the backs of middle-class people paying for tax cuts for billionaires.",2024-09-10,Democrat
MUIR,"President Trump, I'll give you two minutes.",2024-09-10,Moderator
TRUMP,"First of all, I have no sales tax. That's an incorrect statement. She knows that. We're doing tariffs on other countries. Other countries are going to finally, after 75 years, pay us back for all that we've done for the world. And the tariff will be substantial in some cases. I took in billions and billions of dollars, as you know, from China. In fact, they never took the tariff off because it was so much money, they can't. It would totally destroy everything that they've set out to do. They're taking in billions of dollars from China and other places. They've left the tariffs on. When I had it, I had tariffs and yet I had no inflation. Uh, look, we've had a terrible economy because inflation has--which is really known as a country buster. It breaks up countries. We have inflation like very few people have ever seen before. Probably the worst in our nation's history. We were at 21%. But that's being generous because many things are 50, 60, 70, and 80% higher than they were just a few years ago. This has been a disaster for people, for the middle class, but for every class. On top of that, we have millions of people pouring into our country from prisons and jails, from mental institutions and insane asylums. And they're coming in and they're taking jobs that are occupied right now by African Americans and Hispanics and also unions. Unions are going to be affected very soon. And you see what's happening. You see what's happening with towns throughout the United States. You look at Springfield, Ohio. You look at Aurora in Colorado. They are taking over the towns. They're taking over buildings. They're going in violently. These are the people that she and Biden let into our country. And they're destroying our country. They're dangerous. They're at the highest level of criminality. And we have to get 'em out. We have to get 'em out fast. I created one of the greatest economies in the history of our country. I'll do it again and even better.",2024-09-10,Republican
MUIR,We are going to get to immigration and border security during this debate. But I would like to let Vice President Harris respond on the economy here.,2024-09-10,Moderator
HARRIS,"Well, I would love to. Let's talk about what Donald Trump left us. Donald Trump left us the worst unemployment since the Great Depression. Donald Trump left us the worst public health epidemic in a century. Donald Trump left us the worst attack on our democracy since the Civil War. And what we have done is clean up Donald Trump's mess. What we have done and what I intend to do is build on what we know are the aspirations and the hopes of the American people. But I'm going to tell you all, in this debate tonight, you're gonna hear from the same old, tired playbook, a bunch of lies, grievances and name-calling. What you're gonna hear tonight is a detailed and dangerous plan called Project 2025 that the former president intends on implementing if he were elected again. I believe very strongly that the American people want a president who understands the importance of bringing us together knowing we have so much more in common than what separates us. And I pledge to you to be a president for all Americans.",2024-09-10,Democrat
MUIR,"President Trump, I'll give you a minute here to respond.",2024-09-10,Moderator
TRUMP,"Number one, I have nothing to do, as you know and as she knows better than anyone, I have nothing to do with Project 2025. That's out there. I haven't read it. I don't wanna read it, purposely. I'm not going to read it. This was a group of people that got together, they came up with some ideas. I guess some good, some bad. But it makes no difference. I have nothing to do--everybody knows I'm an open book. Everybody knows what I'm going to do. Cut taxes very substantially. And create a great economy like I did before. We had the greatest economy. We got hit with a pandemic. And the pandemic was--not since 1917 where 100 million people died has there been anything like it. We did a phenomenal job with the pandemic. We handed them over a country where the economy and where the stock market was higher than it was before the pandemic came in. Nobody's ever seen anything like it. We made ventilators for the entire world. We got gowns. We got masks. We did things that nobody thought possible. And people give me credit for rebuilding the military. They give me credit for a lot of things. But not enough credit for the great job we did with the pandemic. But the only jobs they got were bounce-back jobs. These were jobs, bounce-back. And it bounced back and it went to their benefit. But I was the one that created them. They know it and so does everybody else.",2024-09-10,Republican
MUIR,"Vice President Harris, I'll let you respond.",2024-09-10,Moderator
HARRIS,"So, Donald Trump has no plan for you. And when you look at his economic plan, it's all about tax breaks for the richest people. I am offering what I describe as an opportunity economy, and the best economists in our country, if not the world, have reviewed our relative plans for the future of America. What Goldman Sachs has said is that Donald Trump's plan would make the economy worse. Mine would strengthen the economy. What the Wharton School has said is Donald Trump's plan would actually explode the deficit. Sixteen Nobel laureates have described his economic plan as something that would increase inflation and, by the middle of next year, would invite a recession. You just have to look at where we are and where we stand on the issues. And I'd invite you to know that Donald Trump actually has no plan for you, because he is more interested in defending himself than he is in looking out for you.",2024-09-10,Democrat
TRUMP,"That's just a sound bite. They gave her that to say. Look, I went to the Wharton School of Finance and many of those professors, the top professors, think my plan is a brilliant plan, it's a great plan. It's a plan that's gonna bring up our worth, our value as a country. It's going to make people want to be able to go and work and, uh, create jobs and create a lot of good, solid money for our--for our country. And just to finish off, uh, she doesn't have a plan. She copied Biden's plan. And it's like four sentences, like run-Spot-run. Four sentences that are just oh, we'll try and lower taxes. She doesn't have a plan. Take a look at her plan. She doesn't have a plan.",2024-09-10,Republican
MUIR,"Mr. President, I do want to drill down on something you both brought up. The vice president brought up your tariffs you responded and let's drill down on this because your plan is, what she calls is a essentially a national sales tax. Your proposal calls for tariffs as you pointed out here, on foreign imports across the board. You recently said that you might double your plan, imposing tariffs up to 20% on good coming into this country. As you know many economists say that with tariffs at that level costs are then passed onto the consumer. Vice President Harris has argued it'll mean higher prices on gas, food, clothing medication arguing it costs the typical family nearly four thousand dollars a year. Do you believe Americans can afford higher prices because of tariffs.",2024-09-10,Moderator
TRUMP,"They aren't gonna have higher prices what's gonna have, and who's going to have higher prices is China and all of the countries that have been ripping us off for years. I charge, I was the only president ever--China was paying us hundreds of billions of dollars and so were other countries and you know if she doesn't like 'em they shouldaa gone out and they should have immediately cut the tariffs but those tariffs are there three and a half years now under their administration. We are gonna take in billions of dollars, hundreds of billions of dollars. I had no inflation, virtually no inflation, they had the highest inflation, perhaps in the history of our country because I've never seen a worse period of time. People can't go out and buy cereal or bacon or eggs or anything else. These--the people of our country are absolutely dying with what they've done. They've destroyed the economy and all you have to do is look at a poll. The polls say 80 and 85 and even 90% that the Trump economy was great that their economy was terrible.",2024-09-10,Republican
MUIR,Vice President Harris I do want to ask for your response and you heard what the president said there because the Biden administration did keep a number of the Trump tariffs in place so how do you respond?,2024-09-10,Moderator
HARRIS,"Well, let's be clear that the Trump administration resulted in a trade deficit, one of the highest we've ever seen in the history of America. He invited trade wars, you wanna talk about his deal with China--what he ended up doing is under Donald Trump's presidency he ended up selling American chips to China to help them improve and modernize their military. Basically sold us out, when a policy about China should be in making sure the United States of America wins the competition for the 21st century. Which means focusing on the details of what that requires, focusing on relationships with our allies; focusing on investing in American based technology so that we win the race on A.I., on quantum computing; focusing on what we need to do to support America's workforce, so that we don't end up having the--on the short end of the stick in terms of workers' rights. But what Donald Trump did, let's talk about this, with COVID, is he actually thanked President Xi for what he did during COVID. Look at his tweet. ""Thank you, President Xi,"" exclamation point. When we know that Xi was responsible for lacking and not giving us transparency about the origins of COVID.",2024-09-10,Democrat
MUIR,"President Trump, I'll let you respond.",2024-09-10,Moderator
TRUMP,"First of all, they bought their chips from Taiwan. We hardly make chips anymore because of, uh, philosophies like they have and policies like they have. I don't say her because she has no policy. Everything that she believed three years ago and four years ago is out the window. She's going to my philosophy now. In fact, I was gonna send her a MAGA hat. She's gone to my philosophy. But, if she ever got elected, she'd change it. And it will be the end of our country. She's a Marxist. Everybody knows she's a Marxist. Her father's a Marxist professor in economics. And he taught her well. But when you look at what she's done to our country and when you look at these millions and millions of people that are pouring into our country monthly where it's, I believe 21 million people, not the 15 that people say, and I think it's a lot higher than the 21. That's bigger than New York state. Pouring in. And just look at what they're doing to our country. They're criminals. Many of these people coming in are criminals. And that's bad for our economy too. You know, you mentioned before, we'll talk about immigration later.",2024-09-10,Republican

DAVIS,"I want to turn to the issue of abortion. President Trump, you've often touted that you were able to kill Roe v. Wade. Last year, you said that you were proud to be the most pro-life president in American history. Then last month you said that your administration would be great for women and their reproductive rights. In your home state of Florida, you surprised many, uh, with regard to your six-week abortion ban because you initially had said that it was too short and you said, ""I'm going to be voting that we need more than six weeks."" But then the very next day, you reversed course and said you would vote to support the six-week ban. Vice President Harris says that women shouldn't trust you on the issue of abortion because you've changed your position so many times. Therefore, why should they trust you?",2024-09-10,Moderator
TRUMP,"Well, the reason I'm doing that vote is because the plan is, as you know, the vote is, they have abortion in the ninth month. They even have, and you can look at the governor of West Virginia, the previous governor of West Virginia, not the current governor, who's doing an excellent job, but the governor before. He said the baby will be born and we will decide what to do with the baby. In other words, we'll execute the baby.",2024-09-10,Republican
TRUMP,"And that's why I did that, because that predominates. Because they're radical. The Democrats are radical in that. And her vice presidential pick, which I think was a horrible pick, by the way for our country, because he is really out of it. But her vice presidential pick says abortion in the ninth month is absolutely fine. He also says execution after birth, it's execution, no longer abortion, because the baby is born, is okay. And that's not okay with me. Hence the vote. But what I did is something, for 52 years they've been trying to get Roe v. Wade into the states.",2024-09-10,Republican
TRUMP,"And through the uh genius and, and heart and strength of six Supreme Court justices we were able to do that. Now, I believe in the exceptions for rape, incest, and life of the mother. I believe strongly in it. Ronald Reagan did also. Eighty-five percent of Republicans do--exceptions. It's very important. But we were able to get it. And now states are voting on it. And for the first time you're gonna see--look, this is an issue that's torn our country apart for 52 years. Every legal scholar, every Democrat, every Republican, liberal, conservative, they all wanted this issue to be brought back to the states where the people could vote. And that's what happened, happened. Now, Ohio, the vote was somewhat liberal. Kansas the vote was somewhat liberal. Much more liberal than people would have thought. But each individual state is voting. It's the vote of the people now. It's not tied up in the federal government. I did a great service in doing it. It took courage to do it. And the Supreme Court had great courage in doing it. And I give tremendous credit to those six justices.",2024-09-10,Republican
DAVIS,"There is no state in this country where it is legal to kill a baby after it's born. Madam Vice-President, I want to get your response to President Trump.",2024-09-10,Moderator
HARRIS,"Well, as I said, you're going to hear a bunch of lies. And that's not actually a surprising fact. Let's understand how we got here. Donald Trump hand-selected three members of the United States Supreme Court with the intention that they would undo the protections of Roe v. Wade. And they did exactly as he intended. And now in over 20 states there are Trump abortion bans which make it criminal for a doctor or nurse to provide health care. In one state it provides prison for life. Trump abortion bans that make no exception even for rape and incest. Which, understand what that means: A survivor of a crime of violation to their body, does not have the right to make a decision about what happens to their body next. That is immoral. And one does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held beliefs to agree the government, and Donald Trump certainly, should not be telling a woman what to do with her body.",2024-09-10,Democrat
HARRIS,"I have talked with women around our country. You wanna talk about this is what people wanted? Pregnant women who want to carry a pregnancy to term suffering from a miscarriage, being denied care in an emergency room because the health care providers are afraid they might go to jail and she's bleeding out in a car in the parking lot? She didn't want that. Her husband didn't want that. A 12 or 13-year-old survivor of incest being forced to carry a pregnancy to term? They don't want that. And I pledge to you when Congress passes a bill to put back in place the protections of Roe v. Wade as President of the United States, I will proudly sign it into law. But understand, if Donald Trump were to be re-elected, he will sign a national abortion ban. Understand, in his Project 2025 there would be a national abortion--a monitor that would be monitoring your pregnancies, your miscarriages. I think the American people believe that certain freedoms, in particular the freedom to make decisions about one's own body, should not be made by the government.",2024-09-10,Democrat
DAVIS,"Thank you, Vice President Harris.",2024-09-10,Moderator
TRUMP,"Well, there she goes again. It's a lie. I'm not signing a ban. And there's no reason to sign a ban. Because we've gotten what everybody wanted. Democrats, Republicans and everybody else and every legal scholar wanted it to be brought back into the states. And the states are voting. And it may take a little time, but for 52 years this issue has torn our country apart. And they've wanted it back in the states. And I did something that nobody thought was possible. The states are now voting. What she says is an absolute lie. And as far as the abortion ban, no, I'm not in favor of abortion ban. But it doesn't matter, because this issue has now been taken over by the states.",2024-09-10,Republican
DAVIS,Would you veto a national abortion ban if it came to your desk--,2024-09-10,Moderator
TRUMP,"--Well, I won't have to because again--two things. Number one, she said she'll go back to Congress. She'll never get the vote. It's impossible for her to get the vote. Especially now with a 50-50 in--essentially 50-50 in both Senate and the House. She's not gonna get the vote. She can't get the vote. She won't even come close to it. So it's just talk. You know what it reminds me of? When they said they're gonna get student loans terminated and it ended up being a total catastrophe. The student loans--and then her--I think probably her boss, if you call 'em a boss, he spends all his time on the beach--but look, her boss went out and said we'll do it again, we'll do it a different way. He went out, got rejected again by the Supreme Court. So all these students got uh, taunted with this whole thing about--this whole idea. And how unfair that would have been-- part of the reason they lost--to the millions and millions of people that hadda pay off their student loans. They didn't get it for free. But they were saying--it's the same way that they talked about that, that they talk about abortion.",2024-09-10,Republican
DAVIS,But if I could just get a Yes or No. Because your running mate jen--J.D. Vance has said that you would veto if it did come to your desk.,2024-09-10,Moderator
TRUMP,"Well, I didn't discuss it with J.D., in all fairness. J.D.--and I don't mind if he has a certain view but I think he was speaking for me, but I really didn't. Look, we don't have to discuss it because she'd never be able to get it just like she couldn't get student loans. They couldn't get--they didn't even come close to getting student loans. They didn't even come close to getting student loans. They taunted young people--and a lot of other people that had loans. They can never get this approved. So it doesn't matter what she says about going to Congress. Wonderful. Let's go to Congress. Do it. But the fact is that for years they wanted to get it out of Congress and out of the federal government and we did something that everybody said couldn't be done. And now you have a vote of the people on abortion.",2024-09-10,Republican
DAVIS,"Vice President Harris, I want to give you your time to respond. But I do want to ask, would you support any restrictions on a woman's right to an abortion?",2024-09-10,Moderator
HARRIS,"I absolutely support reinstating the protections of Roe v. Wade. And as you rightly mentioned, nowhere in America is a woman carrying a pregnancy to term and, and, and asking for an abortion. That is not happening. It's insulting to the women of America. And understand what has been happening under Donald Trump's abortion bans. Couples who pray and, and, and dream of having a family are being denied IVF treatments. What is happening in our country, working people, working women who are working one or two jobs, who can barely afford childcare as it is, have to travel to another state--to get on a plane sitting next to strangers--to go and get the health care she needs. Barely can afford to do it, and what you are putting her through is unconscionable. And the people of America have not--the, the majority of Americans believe in a woman's right to make decisions about her own body. And that is why in every state where this issue has been on the ballot, in red and blue states both, the people of America have voted for freedom.",2024-09-10,Democrat
DAVIS,Vice President Harris--,2024-09-10,Moderator

In fact, when they got a very negative decision on IVF from the Alabama courts, I saw the people of Alabama and the legislature two days later voted it in. I've been a leader on it. They know that and everybody else knows it. I have been a leader on fertilization, IVF.

MUIR,"We're going to turn now to immigration and border security. We know it's an issue that's important to Republicans, Democrats, voters across the board, uh, in this country. Vice President Harris, you were tasked by President Biden with getting to the root causes of migration from Central America. We know that illegal border crossings reached a record high in the Biden Administration. This past June, President Biden imposed tough new asylum restrictions. We know the numbers since then have dropped significantly. But my question to you tonight is why did the administration wait until six months before the election to act and would you have done anything differently from President Biden on this?",2024-09-10,Moderator
HARRIS,"So I'm the only person on this stage who has prosecuted transnational criminal organizations for the trafficking of guns, drugs, and human beings. And let me say that the United States Congress, including some of the most conservative members of the United States Senate, came up with a border security bill which I supported. And that bill would have put fifteen hundred more border agents on the border to help those folks who are workin' there right now overtime trying to do their job. It would have allowed us to stem the flow of fentanyl coming into the United States. I know there are so many families watching tonight who have been personally affected by the surge of fentanyl in our country. That bill would have put more resources to allow us to prosecute transnational criminal organizations for trafficking in guns, drugs and human beings. But you know what happened to that bill? Donald Trump got on the phone, called up some folks in Congress, and said kill the bill. And you know why? Because he'd prefer to run on a problem instead of fixing a problem. And understand, this comes at a time where the people of our country actually need a leader who engages in solutions, who actually addresses the problems at hand. But what we have in the former president is someone who would prefer to run on a problem instead of fixing a problem. And I'll tell you something, he's going to talk about immigration a lot tonight even when it's not the subject that is being raised. And I'm going to actually do something really unusual and I'm going to invite you to attend one of Donald Trump's rallies because it's a really interesting thing to watch. You will see, during the course of his rallies he talks about fictional characters like Hannibal Lecter. He will talk about windmills cause cancer. And what you will also notice is that people start leaving his rallies early out of exhaustion and boredom. And I will tell you, the one thing you will not hear him talk about, is you. You will not hear him talk about your needs, your dreams, and your ne--your desires. And I'll tell ya, I believe you ne--deserve a president who actually puts you first.

And the people that do go, she's busing 'em in and paying them to be there. And then showing them in a different light. So, she can't talk about that. People don't leave my rallies. We have the biggest rallies, the most incredible rallies in the history of politics. That's because people want to take their country back. Our country is being lost. We're a failing nation. And it happened three and a half years ago. And what, what's going on here, you're gonna end up in World War 3, just to go on to another subject. What they have done to our country by allowing these millions and millions of people to come into our country. And look at what's happening to the towns all over the United States. And a lotta towns don't want to talk--not gonna be Aurora or Springfield. A lotta towns don't want to talk about it because they're so embarrassed by it. In Springfield, they're eating the dogs. The people that came in. They're eating the cats. They're eating--they're eating the pets of the people that live there. And this is what's happening in our country. And it's a shame. As far as rallies are concerned, as far as--the reason they go is they like what I say. They wanna bring our country back. They wanna make America great again. It's a very simple phrase. Make America great again. She's destroying this country. And if she becomes President, this country doesn't have a chance of success. Not only success.

And if you wanna really know the inside track on who the former President is, if he didn't make it clear already, just ask people who have worked with him. His former Chief of Staff, a four-star general, has said he has contempt for the Constitution of the United States. His former National Security Adviser has said he is dangerous and unfit. His former Secretary of Defense has said the nation, the republic would never survive another Trump term.

They never fired one person. They didn't fire anybody having to do with Afghanistan and the Taliban and the 13 people who's, who's--were just killed, viciously and violently killed, and I got to know the parents and the family. They should have fired all those Generals, all those top people because that was one of the most incompetently handled situations anybody has ever seen. So when somebody does a bad job, I fire 'em. And you take a guy like Esper. He was no good, I fired him. So he writes a book. Another one writes a book. Because with me they can write books. With nobody else can they. But they have done such a poor job. And they never fire anybody. Look at the economy. Look how--look at the inflation. They didn't fire any of their economists. They have the same people.

They allowed people to come in, drug dealers, to come into our country, and they're now in the United States. And told by their countries like Venezuela don't ever come back or we're going to kill you. Do you know that crime in Venezuela and crime in countries all over the world is way down? You know why? Because they've taken their criminals off the street and they've given them to her to put into our country. And, this will be one of the greatest mistakes in history for them to allow--and I think they probably did it because they think they're going to get votes. But it's not worth it. Because they're--they're destroying the fabric of our country by what they've done. There's never been anything done like this at all. They've destroyed the fabric of our country. Millions of people let in. And all over the world crime is down. All over the world except here. Crime here is up and through the roof. Despite their fraudulent statements that they made.

DAVIS,"Vice President Harris, in your last run for president you said you wanted to ban fracking. Now you don't. You wanted mandatory government buyback programs for assault weapons. Now your campaign says you don't. You supported decriminalizing border crossings. Now you're taking a harder line. I know you say that your values have not changed. So then why have so many of your policy positions changed?",2024-09-10,Moderator
HARRIS,"So, my values have not changed. And I'm going to discuss every one--at least every point that you've made. But in particular, let's talk about fracking because we're here in Pennsylvania. I made that very clear in 2020. I will not ban fracking. I have not banned fracking as Vice President of the United States. And, in fact, I was the tie-breaking vote on the Inflation Reduction Act, which opened new leases for fracking. My position is that we have got to invest in diverse sources of energy so we reduce our reliance on foreign oil. We have had the largest increase in domestic oil production in history because of an approach that recognizes that we cannot over-rely on foreign oil.",2024-09-10,Democrat
HARRIS,"As it relates to my values, let me tell you, I grew up a middle-class kid raised by a hard-working mother who worked and saved and was able to buy our first home when I was a teenager. The values I bring to the importance of home ownership, knowing not everybody got handed $400 million on a silver platter and then filed bankruptcy six times, is a value that I bring to my work, to say we are going to work with the private sector and home builders to increase 3 million homes, increase by 3 million homes by the end of my first term. My work that is related to having a friend when I was in high school who was sexually assaulted by her stepfather. And my focus then, on protecting women and children from violent crime, is based on a value that is deeply grounded in the importance of standing up for those who are most vulnerable. My work that is about protecting social security and Medicare is based on long-standing work that I have done--protecting seniors from scams. My values have not changed. And what is important is that there is a president who actually brings values and a perspective that is about lifting people up and not beating people down and name-calling. The true measure of the leader is the leader who actually understands that strength is not in beating people down, it's in lifting people up. I intend to be that president.",2024-09-10,Democrat
DAVIS,"President Trump, your response.",2024-09-10,Moderator
TRUMP,"Well, first of all, I wasn't given $400 million. I wish I was. My father was a Brooklyn builder. Brooklyn, Queens. And a great father and I learned a lot from 'im. But I was given a fraction of that, a tiny fraction, and I built it into many, many billions of dollars. Many, many billions. And when people see it, they are even surprised. So, we don't have to talk about that. Fracking? She's been against it for 12 years. Uh, defund the police. She's been against [sic] that forever. She gave all that stuff up, very wrongly, very horribly. And everybody's laughing at it, okay? They're all laughing at it. She gave up at least 12 and probably 14 or 15 different policies. Like, she was big on defund the police.",2024-09-10,Republican

TRUMP,"She went out--she went out in Minnesota and wanted to let criminals that killed people, that burned down Minneapolis, she went out and raised money to get 'em out of jail. She did things that nobody would ever think of. Now she wants to do transgender operations on illegal aliens that are in prison. This is a radical left liberal that would do this. She wants to confiscate your guns and she will never allow fracking in Pennsylvania. If she won the election, fracking in Pennsylvania will end on day one. Just to finish one thing, so important in my opinion: So, I got the oil business going like nobody has ever done before. They took, when they took over, they got rid of it, started getting rid of it, and the prices were going up the roof. They immediately let these guys go to where they were. I would have been five times, four times, five times higher because you're talking about 3 1/2 years ago. They got it up to where I was, because they had no choice. Because the prices of energy were quadrupling and doubling. You saw what happened to gasoline. So, they said let's go back to Trump. But if she won the election, the day after that election, they'll go back to destroying our country and oil will be dead, fossil fuel will be dead. We'll go back to windmills and we'll go back to solar, where they need a whole desert to get some energy to come out. You ever see a solar plant? By the way, I'm a big fan of solar.

MUIR,"Linsey, thank you. We have an election in just 56 days. An--I want to talk about the peaceful transfer of power, which of course we all know was a cornerstone of our democracy and the role of a president in a moment of crisis. Uh, Mr. President, on January 6th you told your supporters to march to the Capitol. You said you would be right there with them. The country and the world saw what played out at the Capitol that day. The officers coming under attack. Aides in the West Wing say you watched it unfold on television off the Oval Office. You did send out tweets, but it was more than two hours before you sent out that video message telling your supporters to go home. Is there anything you regret about what you did on that day?",2024-09-10,Moderator
TRUMP,"You just said a thing that isn't covered. Peacefully and patriotically, I said during my speech. Not later on. Peacefully and patriotically. And nobody on the other side was killed. Ashli Babbitt was shot by an out-of-control police officer that should have never, ever shot her. It's a disgrace. But we didn't do--this group of people that have been treated so badly. I ask, what about all the people that are pouring into our country and killing people? That she allowed to pour in. She was the border czar. Remember that. She was the border czar. She doesn't want to be called the border czar because she's embarrassed by the border. In fact, she said at the beginning, I'm surprised you're not talking about the border yet. That's because she knows what a bad job they've done. What about those people? What's, when are they going to be prosecuted? When are these people from countries all over the world, not just South America, they're coming in from all over the world, David, all over the world.

TRUMP,"I had nothing to do with that other than they asked me to make a speech. I showed up for a speech. I said, I think it's going to be big. I went to Nancy Pelosi and the mayor of Washington, D.C. And the mayor put it back in writing, as you know. I said, you know, this is gonna be a very big rally or whatever you want to call it. And again, it wasn't done by me. It was done by others. I said I'd like to give you 10,000 National Guard or soldiers. They rejected me. Nancy Pelosi rejected me. It was just two weeks ago, her daughter has a tape of her saying she is fully responsible for what happened. They want to get rid of that tape. It would have never happened if Nancy Pelosi and the mayor of Washington did their jobs. I wasn't responsible for security. Nancy Pelosi was responsible. She didn't do her job.",2024-09-10,Republican
MUIR,"The question was about you as President, not about Former Speaker Pelosi. But I do want Vice President Harris to respond here.",2024-09-10,Moderator
HARRIS,"I was at the Capitol on January 6th. I was the Vice President-Elect. I was also an acting senator. I was there. And on that day, the President of the United States incited a violent mob to attack our nation's Capitol, to desecrate our nation's Capitol. On that day, 140 law enforcement officers were injured. And some died. And understand, the former President has been indicted and impeached for exactly that reason. But this is not an isolated situation. Let's remember Charlottesville, where there was a mob of people carrying tiki torches, spewing antisemitic hate, and what did the President then at the time say? There were fine people on each side. Let's remember that when it came to the Proud Boys, a militia, the President said, the former President said, ""Stand back and stand by."" So for everyone watching who remembers what January 6th was, I say we don't have to go back. Let's not go back. We're not going back. It's time to turn the page. And if that was a bridge too far for you, well, there is a place in our campaign for you. To stand for country. To stand for our democracy. To stand for rule of law. And to end the chaos. And to end the approach that is about attacking the foundations of our democracy 'cause you don't like the outcome. And be clear on that point. Donald Trump the candidate has said in this election there will be a bloodbath, if this--and the outcome of this election is not to his liking. Let's turn the page on this. Let's not go back. Let's chart a course for the future and not go backwards to the past.",2024-09-10,Democrat

TRUMP,"--I have said blood-bash--bath. It was a different term, and it was a term that related to energy, because they have destroyed our energy business. That was where bloodbath was. Also, on Charlottesville, that story has been as you would say, debunked. Laura Ingraham, Sean Hannity, Jesse--all of these people, they covered it. If they go an extra sentence, they will see it was perfect. It was debunked in almost every newspaper. But they still bring it up, just like they bring 2025 up. They bring all of this stuff up. I ask you this. You talk about the Capitol. Why are we allowing these millions of people to come through on the southern border? How come she's not doing the--and I'll tell you what I would do. And I would be very proud to do it. I would say we would both leave this debate right now, I'd like to see her go down to Washington, D.C. during this debate 'cause we're wasting a lot of time. Go down to--because she's been so bad, it's so ridiculous. Go down to Washington, D.C. And let her sign a bill [sic] to close up the border. Because they have the right to do it.

And they shoulda sent it back to the legislatures for approval. I got almost 75 million votes. The most votes any sitting president has ever gotten. I was told if I got 63, which was what I got in 2016, you can't be beaten. The election, people should never be thinking about an election as fraudulent. We need two things. We need walls.

I'll show you Georgia and I'll show you Wisconsin and I'll show you Pennsylvania and I'll show you--we have so many facts and statistics. But you know what? That doesn't matter.

So he still believes, uh, he did not lose the election uh, that was won by President Biden uh, and and yourself. But I do want to ask you about something that's come up in the last couple of days. This was a post from President Trump about this upcoming election uh, just weeks away. He said, ""When I win, those people who cheated,"" and then he lists donors, voters, election officials, he says ""Will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law, which will include long-term prison sentences.""

HARRIS,"Donald Trump was fired by 81 million people. So, let's be clear about that. And clearly, he is having a very difficult time processing that. But we cannot afford to have a President of the United States who attempts as he did in the past to upend the will of the voters in a free and fair election. And I'm gonna tell you that, uh, I have traveled the world as Vice President of the United States. And world leaders are laughing at Donald Trump. I have talked with military leaders, some of whom worked with you. And they say you're a disgrace. And when you then talk in this way in a presidential debate and deny what over and over again are court cases you have lost, because you did in fact lose that election, it leads one to believe that perhaps we do not have in the candidate to my right the temperament or, or the ability to not be confused about fact.

MUIR,"I'll give you one minute to respond, Mr. President.",2024-09-10,Moderator
TRUMP,"Okay, let me just tell you about world leaders. Viktor Orban, one of the most respected men--they call him a strong man. He's a, he's a tough person. Smart. Prime Minister of Hungary. They said, ""Why is the whole world blowing up? Three years ago it wasn't. Why is it blowing up?"" He said, ""Because you need Trump back as President. They were afraid of him. China was afraid."" And I don't like to use the word afraid but I'm just quoting him. ""China was afraid of him. North Korea was afraid of him."" Look at what's going on with North Korea, by the way. He said, ""Russia was afraid of him."" I ended the Nord Stream 2 pipeline and Biden put it back on day one but he ended the XL pipeline. The XL pipeline in our country. He ended that. But he let the Russians build a pipeline going all over Europe and heading into Germany. The biggest pipeline in the world. Look, Viktor Orban said it. He said the most respected, most feared person is Donald Trump. We had no problems when Trump was President. But when this weak, pathetic man that you saw at a debate just a few months ago that if he weren't in that debate he'd be running instead of her, she got no votes, he got 14 million votes, what you did, you talk about a threat to democracy.

Vice President Harris, in December you said, ""Israel has a right to defend itself"" but you added, ""It matters how."" Saying, ""International humanitarian law must be respected, Israel must do more to protect innocent civilians."" You said that nine months ago. Now an estimated 40,000 Palestinians are dead. Nearly 100 hostages remain. Just last week Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said there's not a deal in the making. President Biden has not been able to break through the stalemate. How would you do it?",2024-09-10,Moderator
HARRIS,"Well, let's understand how we got here. On Oct. 7, Hamas, a terrorist organization, slaughtered twelve hundred Israelis. Many of them young people who were simply attending a concert. Women were horribly raped. And so absolutely, I said then, I say now, Israel has a right to defend itself. We would. And how it does so matters. Because it is also true, far too many innocent Palestinians have been killed. Children, mothers. What we know is that this war must end. It must when--end immediately, and the way it will end is we need a cease-fire deal and we need the hostages out. And so we will continue to work around the clock on that. Work around the clock also understanding that we must chart a course for a two-state solution. And in that solution, there must be security for the Israeli people and Israel and in equal measure for the Palestinians. But the one thing I will assure you always, I will always give Israel the ability to defend itself, in particular as it rates--relates to Iran and any threat that Iran and its proxies pose to Israel. But we must have a two-state solution where we can rebuild Gaza, where the Palestinians have security, self-determination and the dignity they so rightly deserve.",2024-09-10,Democrat

He would have never--and there was no threat of it either, by the way, for four years--have gone into Ukraine and killed millions of people when you add it up. Far worse than people understand what's going on over there. But when she mentions about Israel all of a sudden--she hates Israel. She wouldn't even meet with Netanyahu when he went to Congress to make a very important speech. She refused to be there because she was at a sorority party of hers. She wanted to go to the sorority party. She hates Israel. If she's president, I believe that Israel will not exist within two years from now. And I've been pretty good at predictions. And I hope I'm wrong about that one. She hates Israel. At the same time in her own way she hates the Arab population because the whole place is gonna get blown up, Arabs, Jewish people, Israel. Israel will be gone. It would have never happened. Iran was broke under Donald Trump. Now Iran has $300 billion because they took off all the sanctions that I had. Iran had no money for Hamas or Hezbollah or any of the 28 different spheres of terror. And they are spheres of terror. Horrible terror. They had no money. It was a big story, and you know it. You covered it. Very well, actually. They had no money for terror. They were broke. Now they're a rich nation. And now what they're doing is spreading that money around. Look at what's happening with the Houthis and Yemen. Look at what's going on in the Middle East. This would have never happened. I will get that settled and fast.

MUIR,"Welcome back to this historic ABC news presidential debate tonight. We're going to continue here, and I want to turn to the war in Ukraine. We're now 2 1/2 years into this conflict. Mr. President, it has been the position of the Biden Administration that we must defend Ukraine from Russia, from Vladimir Putin, to defend their sovereignty, their democracy, that it's in America's best interest to do so, arguing that if Putin wins he may be emboldened to move even further into other countries. You have said you would solve this war in 24 hours. You said so just before the break tonight. How exactly would you do that? And, and  I want to ask you a very simple question tonight. Do you want Ukraine to win this war?",2024-09-10,Moderator
TRUMP,"I want the war to stop. I wanna save lives that are being uselessly--people being killed by the millions. It's the millions. It's so much worse than the numbers that you're getting, which are fake numbers. Look, we're in for 250 billion or more, because they don't ask Europe, which is a much bigger beneficiary to getting this thing done than we are. They're in for $150 billion less because Biden and you don't have the courage to ask Europe like I did with NATO. They paid billions and billions, hundreds of billions of dollars when I said either you pay up or we're not gonna protect you anymore. So that may be one of the reasons they don't like me as much as they like weak people. But you take a look at what's happening. We're in for 250 to 275 billion. They're into 100 to 150. They should be forced to equalize. With that being said, I wanna get the war settled. I know Zelenskyy very well, and I know Putin very well. I have a good relationship. And they respect your President. Okay? They respect me. They don't respect Biden. How would you respect him? Why? For what reason? He hasn't even made a phone call in two years to Putin. Hasn't spoken to anybody. They don't even try and get it. That is a war that's dying to be settled. I will get it settled before I even become President. If I win, when I'm President-Elect, and what I'll do is I'll speak to one, I'll speak to the other, I'll get 'em together. That war would have never happened. And in fact when I saw Putin after I left, unfortunately left because our--our country has gone to hell, but after I left when I saw him building up soldiers, he did it after I left, I said oh, he must be negotiating. It must be a good strong point of negotiation. Well, it wasn't because Biden had no idea how to talk to him. He had no idea how to stop it. And now you have millions of people dead and it's only getting worse and it could lead to World War 3. Don't kid yourself, David. We're playing with World War 3.

HARRIS,"Well, first of all, it's important to remind the former President you're not runnin' against Joe Biden, you're runnin' against me. I believe the reason that Donald Trump says that this war would be over within 24 hours is because he would just give it up. And that's not who we are as Americans. Let's understand what happened here. Uh, I actually met with Zelenskyy a few days before Russia invaded, tried through force to change territorial boundaries, to defy one of the most important international rules and norms, which is the importance of sovereignty and territorial integrity. And I met with President Zelenskyy. I shared with him American intelligence about how he could defend himself. Days later I went to NATO's eastern flank, to Poland and Romania. And through the work that I and others did, we brought 50 countries together to support Ukraine in its righteous defense. And because of our support, because of the air defense, the ammunition, the artillery, the javelins, the Abrams tanks that we have provided, Ukraine stands as an independent and free country. If Donald Trump were President, Putin would be sitting in Kyiv right now. And understand what that would mean. Because Putin's agenda is not just about Ukraine. Understand why the European allies and our NATO allies are so thankful that you are no longer President and that we understand the importance of the greatest military alliance the world has ever known, which is NATO. And what we have done to preserve the ability of Zelenskyy and the Ukrainians to fight for their Independence. Otherwise, Putin would be sitting in Kyiv with his eyes on the rest of Europe. Starting with Poland. And why don't you tell the 800,000 Polish Americans right here in Pennsylvania how quickly you would give up, for the sake of favor and what you think is a friendship, with what is known to be a dictator who would eat you for lunch.",2024-09-10,Democrat

TRUMP,"Quiet, please. He would have been sitting in Moscow much happier than he is right now. But eventually, you know, he's got a thing that other people don't have. He's got nuclear weapons. They don't ever talk about that. He's got nuclear weapons. Nobody ever thinks about that. And eventually uh maybe he'll use them. Maybe he hasn't been that threatening. But he does have that. Something we don't even like to talk about. Nobody likes to talk about it. But just so you understand, they sent her to negotiate peace before this war started. Three days later he went in and he started the war because everything they said was weak and stupid. They said the wrong things. That war should have never started. She was the emissary. They sent her in to negotiate with Zelenskyy and Putin. And she did and the war started three days later--",2024-09-10,Republican

As soon as they left Putin did the invasion.",2024-09-10,Republican

HARRIS,"Yet again, I said it at the beginning of this debate, you're going to hear a bunch of lies coming from this fella. And that is another one. When I went to meet with President Zelenskyy, I've now met with him over five times. The reality is, it has been about standing as America always should, as a leader upholding international nul--rules and norms. As a leader who shows strength, understanding that the alliances we have around the world are dependent on our ability to look out for our friends and not favor our enemies, because you adore strongmen instead of caring about democracy. And that is very much what is at stake here. The President of the United States is Commander-in-Chief. And the American people have a right to rely on a president who understands the significance of America's role and responsibility in terms of ensuring that there is stability and ensuring we stand up for our principles and not sell them for the--for the benefit of personal flattery.",2024-09-10,Democrat

It came up in the first hour of the debate, and we witnessed a, a poignant moment today on Capitol Hill honoring the soldiers who died in the chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan. I do want to ask the Vice President, do you believe you bear any responsibility in the way that withdrawal played out?",2024-09-10,Moderator
HARRIS,"Well, I will tell you, I agreed with President Biden's decision to pull out of Afghanistan. Four presidents said they would, and Joe Biden did. And as a result, America's taxpayers are not paying the $300 million a day we were paying for that endless war. And as of today, there is not one member of the United States military who is in active duty in a combat zone in any war zone around the world--the first time this century. But let's understand how we got to where we are. Donald Trump when he was President negotiated one of the weakest deals you can imagine. He calls himself a dealmaker. Even his National Security Adviser said it was a weak, terrible deal. And here's how it went down. He bypassed the Afghan government. He negotiated directly with a terrorist organization called the Taliban. The negotiation involved the Taliban getting 5,000 terrorists, Taliban terrorists, released.",2024-09-10,Democrat
HARRIS,"And get this--no, get this. And the President at the time invited the Taliban to Camp David. A place of storied significance for us as Americans, a place where we honor the importance of American diplomacy, where we invite and receive respected world leaders. And this former President as President invited them to Camp David because he does not again appreciate the role and responsibility of the President of the United States to be Commander in Chief with a level of respect. And this gets back to the point of how he has consistently disparaged and demeaned members of our military, fallen soldiers, and the work that we must do to uphold the strength and the respect of the United States of America around the world.",2024-09-10,Democrat
MUIR,"Vice President Harris, thank you. President Trump, your response to her saying that you began the negotiations with the Taliban.",2024-09-10,Moderator
TRUMP,"Yeah, thank you. So if you take a look at that period of time, the Taliban was killing our soldiers, a lot of 'em, with snipers. And I got involved with the Taliban because the Taliban was doing the killing. That's the fighting force within Afghanistan. They don't bother doing that because you know, they deal with the wrong people all the time. But I got involved. And Abdul is the head of the Taliban. He is still the head of the Taliban. And I told Abdul don't do it anymore, you do it anymore you're gonna have problems. And he said, ""Why do you send me a picture of my house?"" I said, ""You're going to have to figure that out, Abdul."" And for 18 months we had nobody killed. We did have an agreement negotiated by Mike Pompeo. It was a very good agreement. The reason it was good, it was--we were getting out. We would have been out faster than them, but we wouldn't have lost the soldiers. We wouldn't have left many Americans behind. And we wouldn't have left--we wouldn't have left $85 billion worth of brand new beautiful military equipment behind. And just to finish, they blew it. The agreement said you have to do this, this, this, this, this, and they didn't do it. They didn't do it. The agreement was--was terminated by us because they didn't do what they were supposed to do.",2024-09-10,Republican

Mr. President, you recently said of Vice President Harris, ""I didn't know she was Black until a number of years ago when she happened to turn Black, and now she wants to be known as Black."" I want to ask a bigger-picture question here tonight. Why do you believe it's appropriate to weigh in on the racial identity of your opponent?",2024-09-10,Moderator

MUIR,"Vice President Harris, your thoughts on this?",2024-09-10,Moderator
HARRIS,"I think it's, I mean honestly, I think it's a tragedy that we have someone who wants to be President who has consistently over the course of his career attempted to use race to divide the American people. You know, I do believe that the vast majority of us know that we have so much more in common than what separates us. And we don't want this kind of approach that is just constantly trying to divide us, and especially by race. And let's remember how Donald Trump started. He was a, a, a—land, he owned land, he owned buildings, and he was investigated because he refused to rent property to Black families. Let's remember, this is the same individual who took out a full-page ad in The New York Times calling for the execution of five young Black and Latino boys who were innocent, the Central Park Five. Took out a full-page ad calling for their execution. This is the same individual who spread birther lies about the first Black President of the United States. And I think the American people want better than that. Want better than this. Want someone who understands as I do, I travel our country, we see in each other a friend. We see in each other a neighbor. We don't want a leader who is constantly trying to have Americans point their fingers at each other. I meet with people all the time who tell me ""Can we please just have discourse about how we're going to invest in the aspirations and the ambitions and the dreams of the American people?"" Knowing that regardless of people's color or the language their grandmother speaks we all have the same dreams and aspirations and want a president who invests in those, not in hate and division.",2024-09-10,Democrat

And they come up with things like what she just said going back many, many years when a lot of people including Mayor Bloomberg agreed with me on the Central Park Five. They admitted--they said, they pled guilty. And I said, well, if they pled guilty they badly hurt a person, killed a person ultimately. And if they pled guilty--then they pled we're not guilty. But this is a person that has to stretch back years, 40, 50 years ago because there's nothing now. I built one of the greatest economies in the history of the world and I'm gonna build it again. It's going to be bigger, better and stronger. But they're destroying our economy. They have no idea what a good economy is. Their oil policies--every single policy--and remember this. She is Biden. She's trying to get away from Biden. I don't know the gentleman, she says. She is Biden. The worst inflation we've ever had. A horrible economy because inflation has made it so bad.

And what I do offer is a new generation of leadership for our country. One who believes in what is possible, one who brings a sense of optimism about what we can do instead of always disparaging the American people. I believe in what we can do to strengthen our small businesses, which is why I have a plan. Let's talk about our plans. And, and let's compare the plans. I have a plan to give startup businesses $50,000 tax deduction, to pursue their ambitions, their innovation, their ideas, their hard work. I have a plan. $6,000 for young families for the first year of your child's life. To help you in that most critical stage of your child's development. I have a plan that is about allowing people to be able to pursue what has been fleeting in terms of the American dream, by offering a help with down payment of $25,000, down payment assistance for first-time home buyers.

[To President Trump:] This is now your third time running for president. you have long vowed to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. You have failed to accomplish that. You now say you're going to keep Obamacare. Quote, unless we can do something much better. Last month you said, quote, we're working on it. So tonight, nine years after you first started running, do you have a plan and can you tell us what it is?",2024-09-10,Moderator
TRUMP,"Obamacare was lousy health care. Always was. It's not very good today. And what I said, that if we come up with something, and we are working on things, we're going to do it and we're going to replace it. But remember this. I inherited Obamacare because Democrats wouldn't change it. They wouldn't vote for it. They were unanimous. They wouldn't vote to change it. If they woulda done that, we woulda had a much better plan than Obamacare. But the Democrats came up, they wouldn't vote for it. I had a choice to make when I was President, do I save it and make it as good as it can be? Never gonna be great. Or do I let it rot? And I felt I had an obligation, even though politically it would have been good to just let it rot and let it go away. I decided--and I told my people, the top people, and they're very good people--I have a lot of good people in this -- that administration. We read about the bad ones. We had some real bad ones too. And so do they. They have really bad ones. The difference is they don't get rid of 'em. But let me just explain. I had a choice to make do I save it and make it as good as it can be, or do I let it rot? And I saved it. I did the right thing. But it's still never going to be great. And it's too expensive for people. And what we will do is we're looking at different plans. If we can come up with a plan that's going to cost our people, our population, less money and be better health care than Obamacare, then I would absolutely do it. But until then, I'd run it as good as it can be run.",2024-09-10,Republican
DAVIS,"So just a yes or no, you still do not have a plan?",2024-09-10,Moderator
TRUMP,I have concepts of a plan. I'm not President right now. But if we come up with something I would only change it if we come up with something that's better and less expensive.

DAVIS,"Vice president Harris, in 2017 you supported Bernie Sanders' proposal to do away with private insurance and create a government-run health care system. Two years later you proposed a plan that included a private insurance option. What is your plan today?",2024-09-10,Moderator
HARRIS,"Well, first of all, I absolutely support and over the last four years as Vice President, private health care options. But what we need to do is maintain and grow the Affordable Care Act. But I, I'll get to that, Linsey. I just need to respond to a previous point that the former President has made. I've made very clear my position on fracking. And then this business about taking everyone's guns away. Tim Walz and I are both gun owners. We're not taking anybody's guns away. So stop with the continuous lying about this stuff. As it relates to the Affordable Care Act, understand, just look at the history to know where people stand. When Donald Trump was president, 60 times he tried to get rid of the Affordable Care Act. 60 times. I was a Senator at the time. When, I will never forget the early morning hours when it was up for a vote in the United States Senate and the late great John McCain, who you have disparaged as being--uh, you don't like him, you said at the time, because he got caught, he was an American hero. The late great John McCain, I will never forget that night. Walked onto the Senate floor and said no, you don't. No, you don't. No, you don't get rid of the Affordable Care Act. You have no plan. And what the Affordable Care Act has done is eliminate the ability of insurance companies to deny people with pre-existing conditions. I don't have to tell the people watching tonight, you remember what that was like? Remember when an insurance company could deny if a child had asthma, if someone was a breast cancer survivor, if a grandparent had diabetes? And thankfully, as I've been Vice President and we over the last four years have strengthened the Affordable Care Act, we have allowed for the first time Medicare to negotiate drug prices on behalf of you the American people. Donald Trump said he was gonna allow Medicare to negotiate dr, drug prices. He never did. We did. And now we have capped the cost of insulin at $35 a month. Since I've been Vice President we have capped the cost of prescription medication for seniors at $2,000 a year. And when I am President we will do that for all people understanding that the value I bring to this is that access to health care should be a right and not just a privilege of those who can afford it. And the plan has to be to strengthen the Affordable Care Act, not get rid of it--",2024-09-10,Democrat

President Trump, with regard to the environment, you say that we have to have clean air and clean water. Vice President Harris, you call climate change an existential threat. The question to you both tonight is what would you do to fight climate change? And Vice President Harris, we'll start with you. One minute for you each.",2024-09-10,Moderator
HARRIS,"Well, the former President had said that climate change is a hoax. And what we know is that it is very real. You ask anyone who lives in a state who has experienced these extreme weather occurrences, who now is either being denied home insurance or is being jacked up. You ask anybody who has been um, the victim of what that means in terms of losing their home, having nowhere to go. We know that we can actually deal with this issue. The young people of America care deeply about this issue. And I am proud that as Vice President over the last four years we have invested a trillion dollars in a clean energy economy while we have also increased domestic gas production to historic levels. We have created over 800,000 new manufacturing jobs while I have been Vice President. We have invested in clean energy to the point that we are opening up factories around the world. Donald Trump said he was going to create manufacturing jobs. He lost manufacturing jobs. And I'm also proud to have the endorsement of the United Auto Workers and Shawn Fain, who also know that part of building a clean energy economy includes investing in American-made products, American automobiles. It includes growing what we can do around American manufacturing and opening up auto plants, not closing them like happened under Donald Trump.",2024-09-10,Democrat
DAVIS,"Vice President Harris, thank you.",2024-09-10,Moderator
TRUMP,"That didn't happen under Donald Trump. Let me just tell you, they lost 10,000 manufacturing jobs this last month. It's going--they're all leaving. They're building big auto plants in Mexico. In many cases owned by China. They're building these massive plants, and they think they're going to sell their cars into the United States because of these people. What they have given to China is unbelievable. But we're not going to let that. We'll put tariffs on those cars so they can't come into our country. Because they will kill the United Auto Workers and any auto worker, whether it's in Detroit or South Carolina or any other place. What they've done to business and manufacturing in this country is horrible. We have nothing because they, they refuse--you know, Biden doesn't go after people because supposedly China paid him millions of dollars. He's afraid to do it. Between him and his son. They get all this money from Ukraine. They get all this money from all of these different countries. And then you wonder why is he so loyal to this one, that one Ukraine, China? Why is he? Why did he get 3 1/2 million dollars from the mayor of Moscow's wife? Why did he get--why did she pay him 3 1/2 million dollars?

But we're not going back. And I do believe that the American people know we all have so much more in common than what separates us, and we can chart a new way forward. And a vision of that includes having a plan, understanding the aspirations, the dreams, the hopes, the ambition of the American people, which is why I intend to create an opportunity economy, investing in small businesses, in new families, in what we can do around protecting seniors, what we can do that is about giving hard-working folks a break in bringing down the cost of living. I believe in what we can do together that is about sustaining America's standing in the world and ensuring we have the respect that we so rightly deserve including respecting our military and ensuring we have the most lethal fighting force in the world. I will be a President that will protect our fundamental rights and freedoms including the right of a woman to make decisions about her own body and not have her government tell her what to do. I'll tell you, I started my career as a prosecutor. I was a D.A. I was an attorney general. A United States Senator. And now Vice President. I've only had one client. The people. And I'll tell you, as a prosecutor I never asked a victim or a witness are you a Republican or a Democrat. The only thing I ever asked them, are you okay? And that's the kind of president we need right now. Someone who cares about you and is not putting themselves first. I intend to be a president for all Americans and focus on what we can do over the next 10 and 20 years to build back up our country by investing right now in you the American people.",2024-09-10,Democrat

They've had 3 1/2 years to fix the border. They've had 3 1/2 years to create jobs and all the things we talked about. Why hasn't she done it? She should leave right now, go down to that beautiful White House, go to the Capitol, get everyone together and do the things you want to do. But you haven't done it. And you won't do it. Because you believe in things that the American people don't believe in. You believe in things like, we're not going to frack. We're not going to take fossil fuel. We're not going to do--things that are going to make this country strong, whether you like it or not. Germany tried that and within one year they were back to building normal energy plants. We're not ready for it. We can't sacrifice our country for the sake of bad vision. But I just ask one simple question. Why didn't she do it? We're a failing nation. We're a nation that's in serious decline. We're being laughed at all over the world. All over the world, they laugh, I know the leaders very well. They're coming to see me. They call me. We're laughed at all over the world. They don't understand what happened to us as a nation. We're not a leader. We don't have any idea what's going on. We have wars going on in the Middle East. We have wars going on with Russia and Ukraine. We're going to end up in a third World War. And it will be a war like no other because of nuclear weapons, the power of weaponry. I rebuilt our entire military. She gave a lot of it away to the Taliban. She gave it to Afghanistan. What these people have done to our country, and maybe toughest of all is allowing millions of people to come into our country, many of them are criminals, and they're destroying our country.

TAPPER,"Let's begin the debate. And let's start with the issue that voters consistently say is their top concern, the economy.",2024-06-27,Moderator
TAPPER,"President Biden, inflation has slowed, but prices remain high. Since you took office, the price of essentials has increased. For example, a basket of groceries that cost $100, then, now costs more than $120. And typical home prices have jumped more than 30 percent.",2024-06-27,Moderator
TAPPER,What do you say to voters who feel they are worse off under your presidency than they were under President Trump?,2024-06-27,Moderator
BIDEN,"We've got to take a look at what I was left when I became president, what Mr. Trump left me.",2024-06-27,Democrat
BIDEN,"We had an economy that was in freefall. The pandemic was so badly handled. Many people were dying. All he said was it's not that serious, just inject a little bleach in your arm. You'll be all right.",2024-06-27,Democrat
BIDEN,The economy collapsed. There were no jobs. The unemployment rate rose to 15 percent. It was terrible.,2024-06-27,Democrat
BIDEN,"And so, what we had to do is try to put things back together again. And that's exactly what we began to do. We created 15,000 new jobs. We brought out in a position where we have 800,000 new manufacturing jobs.",2024-06-27,Democrat
BIDEN,But there's more to be done. There's more to be done. Working-class people are still in trouble.,2024-06-27,Democrat
BIDEN,"I come from Scranton, Pennsylvania. I come of household where the kitchen table – if things weren't able to be met during the month, was a problem. Price of eggs, the price of gas, the price of housing, the price of a whole range of things.",2024-06-27,Democrat
BIDEN,"That's why I'm working so hard to make sure I deal with those problems, and we're going to make sure that we have reduced the price of housing. We're going to make sure we build 2 million new units. We're going to make sure we cap rents, so corporate greed can't take over.",2024-06-27,Democrat
BIDEN,The combination of what I was left with and corporate greed are the reason why we're in this problem right now.,2024-06-27,Democrat
BIDEN,"In addition to that, we're in a situation where if you had to take a look at all that was done at his administration, he didn't do much at all. By the time he left, there's – things were in chaos, literally chaos.",2024-06-27,Democrat
BIDEN,"And so we put things back together. We created, as I said, those jobs. We made sure we had a situation where we now – we brought down the price of prescription drugs, which is a major issue for many people, to $15 for – for an insulin shot, as opposed to $400. No senior has to pay more than $200 for any drug, all the drugs they can include (ph) beginning next year.",2024-06-27,Democrat
BIDEN,"And the situation is making – and we're going to make that available to everybody, to all Americans. So we're working to bring down the price of – around the kitchen table. And that's what we're going to get done.",2024-06-27,Democrat

TAPPER,President Trump?,2024-06-27,Moderator
TRUMP,We had the greatest economy in the history of our country. We have never done so well. Every – everybody was amazed by it. Other countries were copying us.,2024-06-27,Republican
TRUMP,"We got hit with COVID. And when we did, we spent the money necessary so we wouldn't end up in a Great Depression, the likes of which we had in 1929. By the time we finished – so we did a great job. We got a lot of credit for the economy, a lot of credit for the military, and no wars and so many other things. Everything was rocking good.",2024-06-27,Republican
TRUMP,"But the thing we never got the credit for, and we should have, is getting us out of that COVID mess. He created mandates – that was a disaster for our country.",2024-06-27,Republican
TRUMP,"But other than that, we had – we had given them back a – a country where the stock market actually was higher than pre-COVID. And nobody thought that was even possible. The only jobs he created are for illegal immigrants and bounce-back jobs, they're bounced back from the COVID.",2024-06-27,Republican
TRUMP,He has not done a good job. He has done a poor job. And inflation's killing our country. It is absolutely killing us.,2024-06-27,Republican
TAPPER,Thank you.,2024-06-27,Moderator
TAPPER,President Biden?,2024-06-27,Moderator
BIDEN,"Well, look, the greatest economy in the world, he's the only one who thinks that, I think. I don't know anybody else who thinks it was great – he had the greatest economy in the world.",2024-06-27,Democrat
BIDEN,"And, you know, the fact of the matter is that we found ourselves in a situation where his economy, he rewarded the wealthy. He had the largest tax cut in American history, $2 trillion. He raised the deficit larger than any president has in any one term. He's the only president other than Herbert Hoover who has lost more jobs than he had when he began, since Herbert Hoover. The idea that he did something that was significant.",2024-06-27,Democrat
BIDEN,"And the military, you know, when he was president, they were still killing people in Afghanistan. And he didn't do anything about that. When he was president, we were still finding ourselves in a position where you had a notion that we were this safe country. The truth is, I'm the only president this century that doesn't have any this – this decade, that doesn't have any troops dying anywhere in the world, like he did.",2024-06-27,Democrat
TAPPER,"President Trump, I want to follow up, if I can, you want –",2024-06-27,Moderator
TAPPER,[crosstalk],2024-06-27,Moderator
TRUMP,Am I allowed to respond to him?,2024-06-27,Republican
TAPPER,"Well, I'm going to ask you a follow-up. You can do whatever you want with the minute that we give you. I want to follow up. You want to impose a 10 percent tariff on all goods coming into the U.S. How will you ensure that that doesn't drive prices even higher?",2024-06-27,Moderator
TRUMP,"It's not going to drive them higher. It's just going to cause countries that have been ripping us off for years, like China – and many others, in all fairness to China – it's going to just force them to pay us a lot of money, reduce our deficit tremendously, and give us a lot of power for other things.",2024-06-27,Republican
TRUMP,But he – he made a statement. The only thing he was right about is I gave you the largest tax cut in history. I also gave you the largest regulation cut in history. And that's why we had all the jobs. And the jobs went down and then they bounced back and he's taking credit for bounce-back jobs. You can't do that.,2024-06-27,Republican
TRUMP,"He also said he inherited 9 percent inflation. No, he inherited almost no inflation, and it stayed that way for 14 months. And then it blew up under his leadership because they spent money like a bunch of people that didn't know what they were doing. And they don't know what they were doing. It was the worst – probably the worst administration in history. There's never been.",2024-06-27,Republican
TRUMP,"And as far as Afghanistan is concerned, I was getting out of Afghanistan, but we were getting out with dignity, with strength, with power. He got out, it was the most embarrassing day in the history of our country's life.",2024-06-27,Republican
TAPPER,"President Trump, over the last eight years, under both of your administrations, the national debt soared to record highs. And according to a new non-partisan analysis, President Trump, your administration approved $8.4 trillion in new debt.",2024-06-27,Moderator
TAPPER,"While so far, President Biden, you've approved $4.3 trillion in new debt.",2024-06-27,Moderator
TAPPER,"So former President Trump, many of the tax cuts that you signed into law are set to expire next year. You want to extend them and go even further, you say. With the U.S. facing trillion-dollar deficits and record debt, why should top earners and corporations pay even less in taxes than they do now?",2024-06-27,Moderator
TRUMP,"Because the tax cuts spurred the greatest economy that we've ever seen just prior to COVID, and even after COVID. It was so strong that we were able to get through COVID much better than just about any other country. But we spurred – that tax spurred. Now, when we cut the taxes, as example, the corporate tax was cut down to 21 percent from 39 percent, plus beyond that, we took in more revenue with much less tax and companies were bringing back trillions of dollars back into our country.",2024-06-27,Republican
TRUMP,"The country was going like never before. And we were ready to start paying down debt. We were ready to start using the liquid gold right under our feet, the oil and gas right under our feet. We were going to have something that nobody else has had. We got hit with COVID. We did a lot to fix it. I gave him an unbelievable situation with all of the therapeutics and all of the things that we came up with, we – we gave him something great.",2024-06-27,Republican
TRUMP,"Remember, more people died under his administration, even though we had largely fixed it. More people died under his administration than our administration, and we were right in the middle of it.",2024-06-27,Republican
TRUMP,"Something which a lot of people don't like to talk about, but he had far more people dying in his administration.",2024-06-27,Republican
TRUMP,"He did the mandate, which is a disaster, mandating it. The vaccine went out. He did a mandate on the vaccine, which is the thing that people most objected to about the vaccine. And he did a very poor job, just a very poor job.",2024-06-27,Republican
TRUMP,"And I will tell you, not only poor there, but throughout the entire world, we're no longer respected as a country. They don't respect our leadership. They don't respect the United States anymore.",2024-06-27,Republican
TRUMP,"We're like a Third World nation between weaponization of his election, trying to go after his political opponent. All of the things he's done. We've become like a Third World nation, and it's a shame.",2024-06-27,Republican
TRUMP,"The damage he's done to our country – and I'd love to ask him, and will, why he allowed millions of people to come in here from prisons, jails, and mental institutions to come into our country and destroy our country.",2024-06-27,Republican
TAPPER,"President Trump, we will get to immigration later in this block. President Biden, I want to give you an opportunity to respond to this question about the national debt.",2024-06-27,Moderator
BIDEN,"He had the largest national debt of any president in a four-your period, number one. Number two, he – that $2 trillion tax cut benefited the very wealthy. I – what I'm going to do is fix the tax system.",2024-06-27,Democrat
BIDEN,"For example, we have a thousand trillionaires in America – I mean, billionaires in America. And what's happening? They're in a situation where they, in fact, pay 8.2 percent in taxes. If they just paid 24 percent or 25 percent, either one of those numbers, they'd raised $500 million – billion dollars, I should say, in a 10-year period.",2024-06-27,Democrat
BIDEN,"We'd be able to right wipe out his debt. We'd be able to help make sure that all those things we need to do – childcare, elder care, making sure that we continue to strengthen our healthcare system, making sure that we're able to make every single solitary person eligible for what I've been able to do with the – with – with – with the COVID. Excuse me, with dealing with everything we have to do with – look, if – we finally beat Medicare.",2024-06-27,Democrat
TAPPER,"Thank you, President Biden. President Trump?",2024-06-27,Moderator
TRUMP,"Well, he's right. He did beat Medicare. He beat it to death. And he's destroying Medicare because all of these people are coming in, they're putting them on Medicare. They're putting them on Social Security. They're going to destroy Social Security.",2024-06-27,Republican
TRUMP,"This man is going to single-handedly destroy Social Security. These millions and millions of people coming in, they're trying to put them on Social Security. He will wipe out Social Security. He will wipe out Medicare. So he was right in the way he finished that sentence. And it's a shame.",2024-06-27,Republican
TRUMP,"What's happened to our country in the last four years is not to be believed. Foreign countries, I'm friends with a lot of people. They cannot believe what happened to the United States of America. We're no longer respected. They don't like us.",2024-06-27,Republican
TRUMP,"We give them everything they want, and they think we're stupid. They think we're very stupid people.",2024-06-27,Republican

BASH,"Former President Trump, you take credit for the decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, which returned the issue of abortion to the states.",2024-06-27,Moderator
TRUMP,Correct.,2024-06-27,Republican

TRUMP,"First of all, the Supreme Court just approved the abortion pill. And I agree with their decision to have done that, and I will not block it.",2024-06-27,Republican
TRUMP,"And if you look at this whole question that you're asking, a complex, but not really complex.",2024-06-27,Republican
TRUMP,"Fifty-one years ago, you had Roe v. Wade, and everybody wanted to get it back to the states, everybody, without exception, Democrats, Republicans, liberals, conservatives. Everybody wanted it back. Religious leaders.",2024-06-27,Republican
TRUMP,"And what I did is I put three great Supreme Court justices on the court, and they happened to vote in favor of killing Roe v. Wade and moving it back to the states. This is something that everybody wanted.",2024-06-27,Republican
TRUMP,"Now, 10 years ago or so, they started talking about how many weeks and how many of this are getting into other things, but every legal scholar, throughout the world, the most respected, wanted it brought back to the states. I did that.",2024-06-27,Republican
TRUMP,"Now the states are working it out. If you look at Ohio, it was a decision that was – it was – it was an end result that was a little bit more liberal than you would have thought. Kansas, I would say the same thing. Texas is different. Florida is different.",2024-06-27,Republican
TRUMP,"But they're all making their own decisions right now. And right now, the states control it. That's the vote of the people.",2024-06-27,Republican
TRUMP,"Like Ronald Reagan, I believe in the exceptions, I am a person that believes. And frankly, I think it's important to believe in the exceptions. Some people, you have to follow your heart, some people don't believe in that.",2024-06-27,Republican
TRUMP,"But I believe in the exceptions for rape, incest, and the life of the mother. I think it's very important. Some people don't. Follow your heart.",2024-06-27,Republican
TRUMP,But you have to get elected also and – because that has to do with other things. You've got to get elected.,2024-06-27,Republican
TRUMP,"The problem they have is they're radical because they will take the life of a child in the eighth month, the ninth month, and even after birth – after birth.",2024-06-27,Republican
TRUMP,"If you look at the former governor of Virginia, he was willing to do this. He said, we'll put the baby aside and we'll determine what we do with the baby. Meaning, we'll kill the baby.",2024-06-27,Republican
TRUMP,What happened is we brought it back to the states and the country is now coming together on this issue. It's been a great thing.,2024-06-27,Republican

BIDEN,"And this is the guy who says the states should be able to have it. We're (ph) in a state where in six weeks, you don't even know whether you're pregnant or not, but you cannot see the doctor or have your – and have him decide on what your circumstances are, whether you need help.",2024-06-27,Democrat
BIDEN,"The idea that states are able to do this is a little like saying, we're going to turn civil rights back to the states. Let each state have a different rule.",2024-06-27,Democrat
BIDEN,"Look, there's so many young women who have been – including a young woman who just was murdered and he – he went to the funeral. The idea that she was murdered by a – by –by an immigrant coming in, and they talk about that.

TRUMP,He says he ran because of Charlottesville. He didn't run because of Charlottesville. He ran because it was his last chance at – he's not equipped to be president. You know it and I know it.,2024-06-27,Republican
TRUMP,It's ridiculous. We have a debate. We're trying to justify his presidency.,2024-06-27,Republican

TRUMP,He made up the Charlottesville story and you'll see it's debunked all over the place. Every anchor has – every reasonable actor has debunked it.,2024-06-27,Republican
TRUMP,And just the other day it came out where it was fully debunked. It's a nonsense story. He knows that.,2024-06-27,Republican
TRUMP,And he didn't run because of Charlottesville. He used that as an excuse to run.,2024-06-27,Republican

TAPPER,[commercial break],2024-06-27,Moderator
BASH,Welcome back to the CNN Presidential Debate live from Georgia.,2024-06-27,Moderator
BASH,"Let's talk about persistent challenges you both faced in your first terms, and you'd certainly face again in a second term. President Biden, while black unemployment dropped to a record low under your presidency, black families still earn far less than white families.",2024-06-27,Moderator
BASH,Black mothers are still three times more likely to die for pregnancy related causes. And black Americans are imprisoned at five times the rate of white Americans. What do you say to black voters who are disappointed that you haven't made more progress?,2024-06-27,Moderator
BIDEN,"They acknowledge he made a lot of progress, number one. The facts of the matter is more small black businesses that have been started in any time in history. Number two, the wages of black – black unemployment is the lowest level of spend in a long, long time. Number three, we find them – they're trying to provide housing for black Americans and dealing with segregation that exists among these corporate – these corporate operations that collude to keep people out of their houses.",2024-06-27,Democrat
BIDEN,"And in addition to that, we find that the impact of, on the – the choice that black families have to make relative to childcare is incredibly difficult. When we did the first major piece of legislation in the past, I was able to reduce black childcare costs. I cut them in half, in half. We've got to make sure we provide for childcare costs. We've got to make sure – because when you provide that childcare protections, you increase economic growth because more people can be in the – in the job market.",2024-06-27,Democrat
BIDEN,"So there's more to be done, considerably more to be done, but we've done a great deal so far and I'm not letting up and they know it.",2024-06-27,Democrat
BASH,You have 49 seconds left. What do you say to black voters who are disappointed with the progress so far?,2024-06-27,Moderator
BIDEN,"I say, I don't blame them for being disappointed. Inflation is still hurting them badly. For example, I provided for the idea that any black family, first time home buyer should get a $10,000 tax credit to be able to buy their first home so they can get started.",2024-06-27,Democrat
BIDEN,"I made sure that we're in a situation where all those black families and those black individuals who provided had to take out student loans that were ballooning, that if they were engaged in nursing and anything having to do with volunteerism, if they paid their bills for 10 years on their student debt, all the rest was forgiven after 10 years. Millions have benefited from that and we're going to do a whole lot more for black families.",2024-06-27,Democrat
BASH,Thank you. President Trump?,2024-06-27,Moderator
TRUMP,"And he caused the inflation. He's blaming inflation. And he's right, it's been very bad. He caused the inflation and it's killing black families and Hispanic families and just about everybody. It's killing people. They can't buy groceries anymore. They can't.",2024-06-27,Republican
TRUMP,You look at the cost of food where it's doubled and tripled and quadrupled. They can't live. They're not living anymore. He caused this inflation.,2024-06-27,Republican
TRUMP,"I gave him a country with no, essentially no inflation. It was perfect. It was so good. All he had to do is leave it alone. He destroyed it with his green news scam and all of the other – all this money that's being thrown out the window.",2024-06-27,Republican
TRUMP,"He caused inflation. As sure as you're sitting there, the fact is that his big kill on the black people is the millions of people that he's allowed to come in through the border. They're taking black jobs now and it could be 18. It could be 19 and even 20 million people. They're taking black jobs and they're taking Hispanic jobs and you haven't seen it yet, but you're going to see something that's going to be the worst in our history.",2024-06-27,Republican
BASH,Thank you. President Biden?,2024-06-27,Moderator
BIDEN,"There was no inflation when I became president. You know why? The economy was flat on its back. 15% unemployment, he decimated the economy, absolutely decimated the economy. That's why there was no inflation at the time.",2024-06-27,Democrat
BIDEN,"There were no jobs. We provided thousands of millions of jobs for individuals who were involved communities, including minority communities. We made sure that they have health insurance. We have covered with the ACA has increased. I made sure that they're $8,000 per person in the family to get written off in health care, but this guy wants to eliminate that. They tried 50 times. He wants to get rid of the ACA again, and they're going to try again if they win.",2024-06-27,Democrat
BIDEN,"We find ourselves in a position where the idea that we're not doing any – I put more – we put more police on the street than any administration has. He wants to cut the cops. We're providing for equity, equity, and making sure people have a shot to make it. There is a lot going on. But, on inflation, he caused it by his tremendous amount of seasons in the way he handled the pandemic.",2024-06-27,Democrat
BASH,"Thank you. Another persistent challenge is the climate crisis. 2023 was the hottest year in recorded history, and communities across the country are confronting the devastating effects of extreme heat, intensifying wildfires, stronger hurricanes, and rising sea levels.",2024-06-27,Moderator
BASH,"Former President Trump, you've vowed to end your opponent's climate initiatives. But, will you take any action as President to slow the climate crisis?",2024-06-27,Moderator
TRUMP,"Well, let me just go back to what he said about the police, how close the police are to him. Almost every police group in the nation from every state is supporting Donald J. Trump, almost every police group. And what he has done to the black population is horrible, including the fact that for 10 years he called them super predators. We can't, in the 1990s (ph), we can't forget that. Super predators was his name. And he called it to them for 10, and they've taken great offense at it, and now they see it happening.",2024-06-27,Republican
TRUMP,"But, when they see what I did for criminal justice reform and for the historically black colleges and universities, where I funded them and got them all funded, and the opportunity zones with Tim. As you know, Tim Scott was – incredibly did a great job, a great Senator from South Carolina. He came to me with the idea and it was a great idea. It's one of the most successful economic development acts ever in the country, opportunity zones. And the biggest beneficiary are blacks. And that's why we have the best numbers with them. And maybe ever, if they're saying ever, I read this morning, wherever, the best numbers, he has lost much of the black population because he has done a horrible job for black people. He has also done a horrible job for Hispanics.",2024-06-27,Republican
TRUMP,"But, why do you see these millions of people pouring into our country and they're going to take the jobs? And it's already started. And you haven't seen anything yet. It's a disaster.",2024-06-27,Republican
BASH,"38 seconds left, President Trump. Will you take any action as President to slow the climate crisis?",2024-06-27,Moderator
TRUMP,"So, I want absolutely immaculate clean water and I want absolutely clean air, and we had it. We had H2O. We had the best numbers ever. And we did – we were using all forms of energy, all forms, everything. And yet, during my four years, I had the best environmental numbers ever. And my top environmental people gave me that statistic just before I walked on the stage, actually.",2024-06-27,Republican
BIDEN,"I don't know where the hell he has been. The idea that, Dana, he said is true. I've passed the most extensive, it was the extensive climate change legislation in history, in history. We find ourselves – and by the way, black colleges, I came up with $50 billion for HBCUs, historic black universities and colleges, because they don't have the kind of contributors that they have to build these laboratories and the like. Any black student is capable in college in doing any white student can do. They just have the money. But now, they'll be able to get those jobs in high tech.",2024-06-27,Democrat
BIDEN,"We're in a situation where the idea that he kind of is claiming to have done something that had the cleanest water, the cleanest water? He had not done a damn thing with the environment. He – out of the Paris Peace Accord – Climate Accord, I immediately joined it, because if we reach for 1.5 degrees Celsius at any one point, well, there is no way back. The only existential threat to humanity is climate change. And he didn't do a damn thing about it. He wants to undo all that I've done.",2024-06-27,Democrat
TRUMP,"The Paris Accord was going to cost us a trillion dollars, and China nothing, and Russia nothing, and India nothing. It was a rip off of the United States. And I ended it because I didn't want to waste that money because they treat us horribly. We were the only ones who was costing us money. Nobody else was paying into it. And it was a disaster.",2024-06-27,Republican
TRUMP,"But, everything that he said just now, I'll give you an example. I heard him say before insulin, I'm the one that got the insulin down for the seniors. I took care of the seniors. What he is doing is destroying all of our medical programs because the migrants coming in. They want everybody. And look, I have the biggest heart on the stage. I guarantee you that. And I want to take care of people. But, we're destroying our country. They're taking over our schools, our hospitals, and they're going to be taking over Social Security. He is destroying Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid.",2024-06-27,Republican
BIDEN,"Where does that come from? The idea is that we, in fact – we were the only ones of consequence or not. We're not members of the Paris Accord. How can we do anything we're not able to, the United States can't get this under control? One of the largest polluters in the world. Number one, we're making significant progress. By 2035, we will have cut pollution in half.",2024-06-27,Democrat
BIDEN,We have – we have made significant progress. And we're continuing to make progress.,2024-06-27,Democrat
BIDEN,"We set up a Climate Corps for thousands of young people will learn how to deal with climate, just like the Peace Corps. And we're going to – we're moving in directions that are going to significantly change the elements of the cause of pollution.",2024-06-27,Democrat
BIDEN,"But the idea that he claims that he has the biggest heart up here and he's really concerned about – about pollution and about climate, I've not seen any indication of that.",2024-06-27,Democrat
BIDEN,"And, by the way, with regard to prescription drugs, one company agreed that they would reduce the price to $35, which I was calling for – one, voluntarily. I made sure every company in the world, every pharmaceutical company, cannot have to pay.",2024-06-27,Democrat
BASH,Thank you.,2024-06-27,Moderator
BIDEN,"And, by the way…",2024-06-27,Democrat
TAPPER,"So every day millions of Americans struggle just to make ends meet. For many older Americans, Social Security provides a critical lifeline.",2024-06-27,Moderator
TAPPER,"President Biden, if nothing is done to Social Security, seniors will see their benefits cut in just over 10 years. Will you name tonight one specific step that you're willing to take to keep Social Security solvent?",2024-06-27,Moderator
BIDEN,"Yes, make the very wealthy begin to pay their fair share. Right now, everybody making under $170,000 pays 6 percent of their income, of their paycheck, every single time they get a paycheck, from the time of the first one they get when they're 18 years old.",2024-06-27,Democrat
BIDEN,"The idea that they're going to – I'm not – I've been proposing that everybody, they pay – millionaires pay 1 percent – 1 percent. So no one after – I would not raise the cost of Social Security for anybody under $400,000. After that, I begin to make the wealthy begin to pay their fair share, by increasing from 1 percent beyond, to be able to guarantee the program for life.",2024-06-27,Democrat
TAPPER,"So you still have 82 seconds left. Are there any other measures that you think that would be able to help keep Social Security solvent, or is just – is that one enough?",2024-06-27,Moderator
BIDEN,"Well, that one enough will keep it solvent. But the biggest thing I'll do, if we defeat this man, because he wants to get rid of Social Security; he thinks that there's plenty to cut in Social Security. He's wanting to cut Social Security and Medicare, both times. And that's with – and if you look at the program put forward by the House Republican Caucus that he, I believe, supports, is in fact wanting to cut it as well.",2024-06-27,Democrat
BIDEN,"The idea that we don't need to protect our seniors is ridiculous. We put – and, by the way, the American public has greater health care coverage today than ever before. And under the ACA, as I said, you're in a circumstance where 400,000 people – I mean, 40 million people – would not have insurance because they have a pre-existing condition. The only thing that allows them to have that insurance is the fact that they in fact are part of the ACA.",2024-06-27,Democrat
BIDEN,"And, by the way, the other thing is we're in a situation where I talk about education for black communities. I've raised the number, the amount of money for Pell grants by other $8,000 for anybody making under $70,000 a year, are going to be able to get $15,000 towards their tuition.",2024-06-27,Democrat

TAPPER,President Trump?,2024-06-27,Moderator
TRUMP,"So I've dealt with politicians all my life. I've been on this side of the equation for the last eight years. I've never seen anybody lie like this guy. He lies – I've never seen it. He could look you in the face. So – and about so many other things, too.",2024-06-27,Republican
TRUMP,"And we mentioned the laptop, We mentioned ""Russia, Russia, Russia,"" ""Ukraine, Ukraine, Ukraine."" And everything he does is a lie. It's misinformation and disinformation. The ""losers and suckers"" story that he made up is a total lie on the military. It's a disgrace.",2024-06-27,Republican
TRUMP,"But Social Security, he's destroying it. Because millions of people are pouring into our country, and they're putting them on to Social Security; they're putting them on to Medicare, Medicaid. They're putting them in our hospitals. They're taking the place of our citizens.",2024-06-27,Republican
TRUMP,"They're – what they're doing to the V.A., to our veterans, is unbelievable. Our veterans are living in the street and these people are living in luxury hotels. He doesn't know what he's doing. And it – it's really coming back. I've never seen such anger in our country before.",2024-06-27,Republican
TAPPER,President Biden?,2024-06-27,Moderator
BIDEN,"The idea that veterans are not being taken care of, I told you before – and, by the way, when I said ""suckers and losers,"" he said – he acknowledged after it that he fired that general. That general got fired because he's the one that acknowledged that that's what he said. He was the one standing with Trump when he said it, number one.",2024-06-27,Democrat
BIDEN,"Number two, the idea that we're going to be in a situation where all these millions and millions, the way he talks about it, illegal aliens are coming into the country and taking away our jobs, there's a reason why we have the fastest-growing economy in the world, a reason why we have the most successful economy in the world. We're doing better than any other nation in the world.",2024-06-27,Democrat

TAPPER,"President Biden, thank you so much. Let's turn to the cost of childcare, which many American families struggle to afford.",2024-06-27,Moderator
TAPPER,"President Trump, both you and President Biden have tried to address this issue, but the average cost of childcare in this country has risen to more than $11,000 a year per child. For many families, the cost of childcare for two children is more than their rent. In your second term, what would you do to make childcare more affordable?",2024-06-27,Moderator
TRUMP,"Just to go back. The general got fired because he was no good. And if he said that, that's why he made it up. But we have 19 people that said I didn't say it, and they're very highly respected, much more so than him.",2024-06-27,Republican
TRUMP,"The other thing is, he doesn't fire people. He never fired people. I've never seen him fire anybody. I did fire a lot. I fired Comey because he was no good. I fired a lot of the top people at the FBI, drained the swamp. They were no good. Not easy to fire people. You'd pay a price for it, but they were no good. I inherited these people. I didn't put him there. I didn't put Comey there. He was no good. I fired him.",2024-06-27,Republican
TRUMP,This guy hasn't fired anybody. He never fires. He should have fired every military man that was involved with that Afghan – the Afghanistan horror show. The most embarrassing moment in the history of our country. He didn't fire?,2024-06-27,Republican
TRUMP,"Did you fire anybody? Did you fire anybody that's on the border, that's allowed us to have the worst border in the history of the world? Did anybody get fired for allowing 18 million people, many from prisons, many from mental institutions? Did you fire anybody that allowed our country to be destroyed? Joe, our country is being destroyed as you and I sit up here and waste a lot of time on this debate. This shouldn't be a debate.",2024-06-27,Republican

It's insignificant.",2024-06-27,Republican
TRUMP,"He wants open borders. He wants our country to either be destroyed or he wants to pick up those people as voters. And I don't think – we just can't let it happen. If he wins this election, our country doesn't have a chance. Not even a chance of coming out of this rut. We probably won't have a country left anymore. That's how bad it is.

The finest in the history of the world. No one thinks we're weak. No one wants to screw around with us. Nobody. Number one.,2024-06-27,Democrat
BIDEN,"Number two, the idea that we're talking about worst presidents. I wasn't joking. Look it up. Go online. 159 or 58, don't hold me the exact number, presidential historians. They've had meetings and they voted who's the worst president in American history. One through best to worst. They said he was the worst in all of American history. That's a fact. That's not conjecture. He can argue the wrong, but that's what they voted.",2024-06-27,Democrat
BIDEN,"The idea that he is knowing (ph) – doing anything to deal with child care. He did very – virtually nothing to child care. We should significantly increase the child care tax credit.

BIDEN,"But this tariff – these 10 percent tariffs, everything coming into the country, you know what the economists say?

That was part of this deal we put together, this bipartisan deal.",2024-06-27,Democrat

BIDEN,He never argued. It's not a good bill. It's a really good bill. We need those machines. We need those machines. And we're coming down very hard in every country in Asia in terms of precursors for fentanyl. And Mexico is working with us to make sure they don't have the technology to be able to put it together.

Like go through the first five questions, he couldn't do it. But I took two cognitive tests. I took physical exams every year. And, you know, we knock on wood, wherever we may have wood, that I'm in very good health. I just won two club championships, not even senior, to regular club championships. To do that, you have to be quite smart and you have to be able to hit the ball along way. And I do it. He doesn't do it. He can't hit a ball 50 yards. He challenged me to a golf match. He can hit a ball 50 years.",2024-06-27,Republican
