433,Bush,"Well, I dont think theres a great difference, Mr. Mashek, between my views and President Reagans. One of the reasons I think were an effective team is that I believe firmly in his leadership. Hes really turned this country around. We agree on the economic program. When we came into office, why, inflation was 21, 12 1/2 percent interest was wiping out every single American were 21 1/2 percent if you can believe it. Productivity was down. Savings was down. There was despair. In fact, the leadership of the country told the people that there was a malaise out there. And this president turned it around and Ive been with him every step of the way. And of course I would continue those kinds of programs because its brought America back. Americas better off. People are going back to work. And why Mr. Monad cant understand that theres a new enthusiasm in this country, that America is back, theres new strong leadership, I dont know. He has one answer to the problem. Raise everybodys taxes. He looked right into that lens and he said out there in San Francisco, he said, Im gonna raise your taxes. Well hes had a lot of experience in that and hes sure gonna go ahead and do it. But I remember a statement of Lyndon Johnsons when he was looking around, why his party people werent supporting him, and he said, Hey, they painted their tails white and they ran with the antelopes. Theres a lot of Democratic white tails running with the antelopes. Not one single Democrat has introduced the Mondale tax bill into the Congress. Of course I support the presidents economic program and I support him in everything else. And Im not sure, because of my concept of the vice presidency, that if I didnt, Id go doing what Mr. Mondale has done with Jimmy Carter; jump away from him. I couldnt do that to Ronald Reagan, now, next year or any other time. I have too much trust in him. I have too much friendship for him. And Id feel very uncomfortable doing that.",1984-10-11,Republican,354
435,Bush,"I owe my president my judgment and then I owe him loyalty. You cant have the president of the United States out there looking over his shoulder wondering whether his vice president is going to be supporting him. Mrs. Ferraro has quite a few differences with Vice-President Mondale and I understood it when she changed her position on tuition tax credits. Theyre different on busing; she voted to extend the grain embargo; he now says that he was against it. If they win  and I hope they dont  but if they win, shell have to accommodate some views. But shell give him the same kind of loyalty that Im giving President Reagan. One, were not far apart on anything. Two, I can walk into that Oval Office anytime and give him my judgment and he might agree or he might not. But he also knows I wont be talking about it to the press or I wont be knifing him in the back by leaking to make me look good and complicate the problems of the president of the United States.",1984-10-11,Republican,181
441,Bush,"Well, I was glad to get that vote of confidence from Mrs. Ferraro in my economic judgment. So let me make a statement on the economy. The other clay she was in a plant and she said to the workers, Why are you all voting for, why are so many of you voting for the Reagan-Bush ticket. And there was a long, deathly silence and she said come on, we delivered. Thats the problem. And Im not blaming her except for the liberal voting record in the House. They delivered. They delivered 21  percent interest rates. They delivered what they called malaise. They delivered interest rates that were right off the charts. They delivered take-home pay, checks that were shrinking, and weve delivered optimism. People are going back to work; 6 million of them. And 300,000 jobs a month being created. Thats why there was that deathly silence out there in that plant. They delivered the wrong thing. Ronald Reagan is delivering leadership.",1984-10-11,Republican,163
450,Bush,"No, Mr. White, I think our record on civil rights is a good record. You mentioned the Voting Rights extension; it was extended for the longest period of time by President Reagan. But we have some problems in attracting the black vote, and I think our record deserves better. We have done more for black colleges than any previous administration. We favor enterprise zones to give  and its been blocked by Tip ONeill and that House of Representatives, those liberals in that House blocked a new idea to bring jobs into the black communities across the country. And because its not an old handout, special federal spending program, its blocked there  a good idea. And Id like to sec that tried. Weve brought more civil rights cases in the Justice Department than the previous administration by far. We believe in trying something new to help these black teenage kids; the minimum wage differential that says, Look, to an employer, hire these guys. And, yes, theyre willing to work for slightly less than the minimum wage. Give em a training job in the private sector. We threw out that old CETA that didnt train people for jobs that existed, simply rammed them onto the government payroll, and we put in a thing called the Job Training Partnership Act. Wonderful new legislation thats helping blacks more and more. We think of civil rights as something like crime in your neighborhoods. And, for example, when crime figures are going in the right direction thats good, thats a civil right. Similarly, we think of it in terms of quality of life, and that means interest rates. You know, its funny, Mr. Mondale talks about real interest rates. The real interest rate is what you pay when you go down and try to buy a TV set or buy a car, or do whatever it is. The interest rates when we left office were 21% percent. Inflation! Is it a civil right to have the going right off the chart so youre busting every American family, those who can afford it the least? No, weve got a good record. Weve got it on civil rights legislation, minority set-asides, more help for black colleges, and weve got it in terms of an economy thats offering people opportunity and hope instead of despair.",1984-10-11,Republican,386
452,Bush,"Mr. White, its not trickling down. And Im not suggesting theres no poverty, but I am suggesting the way to work out of poverty is through real opportunity. And in the meantime, the needy are getting more help. Human resource spending is way, way up. Aid for Dependent Children spending is up. Immunization programs are up. Almost every place you can point, contrary to Mr. Mondales  I gotta be careful  but contrary of how he goes around just saying everything bad. If somebody sees a silver lining, he finds a big black cloud out there. Whine on harvest moon! I mean, theres a lot going on, a lotta opportunity.",1984-10-11,Republican,109
458,Bush,"Well, maybe we have a factual  maybe we can ask the experts to go to the books. Theyll do it anyway. Spending for food stamps is way, way up under the Reagan administration, AFDC is up under the Reagan administration, and Im not going to be found wrong on that. I am sure of my facts, and we are trying to help and I think were doing a reasonable job, but we are not going to rest until every single American that wants a job and until this prosperity and this recovery thats benefiting many Americans, benefits all Americans.",1984-10-11,Republican,99
461,Bush,"I do believe in pluralism. I do believe in separation of church and state. I dont consider abortion a religious issue. I consider it a moral issue. I believe the archbishop has every right to do everything he wants in that direction, just as I never faulted Jesse Jackson from taking his message to the black pulpits all across this country, just as I never objected when the nuclear arms, the nuclear freeze or the antinuclear people  many of those movements were led by priests. Suddenly, because a Catholic bishop or an evangelist feels strongly on a political issue, people are saying its merging of church and state. We favor  and I speak confidently for the president  we favor separation of church and state. We favor pluralism. Now somebody says you ought to restore prayer in schools. You dont think its right to prohibit a kid from praying in schools. For years kids were allowed to pray in schools. We dont think thats a merger of church and stare to have nonmandatory voluntary, nongovernment-ordered prayer. And yet some are accusing us of injecting religion into politics. I have no problem with what the archbishop does, and I have no problem with what the evangelists on the right do and I have no problem what the priests on the left do. And it didnt bother me when during the Vietnam War much of the opposition to the government  Democrat and Republican governments  was led by priests, encouraging people to break the law and the adage of the  you know  the civil disobedience thing. So our position, separation of church and stare, pluralism, so no little kid with a minority religion of some sort is going to feel offended or feel left out or feel uncomfortable. But, yes, prayer in school on a voluntary basis worked for many, many years until the Supreme Court ruled differently And Im glad we got this question because I think theres been too much said about religion and politics. We dont believe in denominationally moving in. It wasnt our side that raised the question about our president whether he was a good Christian or not and so I, so thats our position  separation of church and state, pluralism, respect for all.",1984-10-11,Republican,375
463,Bush,"You know, there has been  I have to make a confession  an evolution in my position. Theres been 15 million abortions since 1973, and I dont take that lightly. Theres been a million and a half this year. The president and I do favor a human rights amendment. I favor one that would have an exception for incest and rape, and he doesnt, but we both  only for the life of the mother. And I agree with him on that. So yes, my positions evolved, but Id like to see the American who faced with 15 million abortions isnt rethinking his or her position and Ill just stand with the answer. I support the presidents position  and comfortably  from a moral standpoint.",1984-10-11,Republican,122
471,Bush,"Well I respect that statement, I really and truly do. We have difference on a moral question here on abortion. I notice that Mr. Mondale keeps talking in the debate and now its come here about Mr. Falwell. And I dont know where this canard could have come from about Mr. Falwell picking the Supreme Court justices. Ronald Reagan has made one super outstanding, the only one hes made, appointment to the Supreme Court and that was Sandra Day OConnor, and Mr. Falwell opposed her nomination. We still have respect for him, but he opposed it, and so I hope this lays to rest this slander against the president. We want justices who will interpret the Constitution, not legislate it.",1984-10-11,Republican,120
480,Bush,"What that figure  and I kind of like the way Mrs. Ferraro and Mr. Zaccaro reported  because they reported federal taxes, state and local taxes  gives people a clearer picture. That year I happened to pay a lot of state and local taxes, which as you know are deducted from the other, and so I looked it up the other day, and we had paid  I think its 42 percent  of our gross income in taxes. Now Mr. Mondale the other night took what I  Ill be honest  I think it was a cheap shot  at me, and we did a little looking around to see about his. We cant find his 198I tax return  it may have been released. Maybe my opponent knows whether Mr. Mondale released it. But we did find estimates that his income for those three years is a million, four hundred thousand dollars, and I think he paid about the same percentage as I did in total taxes. He also made a reference that troubled me very much, Mr. Boyd. He started talking about my chauffeur, and you know, Im driven to work by the Secret Service  so is Mrs. Ferraro  so is Mr. Mondale  they protected his life for four years and now theyve done a beautiful job for Barbara and mine. They saved the life of the president of the United States. I think that was a cheap shot  telling the American people to try to divide class  rich and poor. But the big question isnt whether Mrs. Ferraro is doing well. I think theyre doing pretty well, and I know Barbara and I are doing well. And its darn sure that Mr. Mondale is doing well, with a million four in income, but the question really is  after we get through this disclosure  is the tax cut fair? Are people getting a fair break, and the answer is the rich are paying 6 percent more on taxes and the poor are getting a better break. Those lower and middle-income people that have borne the burden for a long time. So yes, I favor disclosure. Ive always disclosed. This year I had my taxes and everything I own in a blind trust  so blind  blinder than the presidents, so I didnt even sign my tax return. But there seemed to be an interest in it so we went to the government ethics committee  they agreed to change the trust. The trust has been revealed, and I was sure glad to see that I had paid 42 percent of my gross income in taxes.",1984-10-11,Republican,430
482,Bush,"Im really a Texan. But I got one house. And under the law, every taxpayer is allowed, when he sells a house, and buys another house, to get the rollover. Everybody, if it turns out, and I may hire, I notice she said she has a new good accountant. Id like to get his name and phone number because I think Ive paid too much in the way of taxes. And residence, Mr. Boyd, legal residence, for voting, is very different. And the domicile, they call that, very different, than the house. That they say youre living in the vice-presidents house. Therefore you dont get what every  Ive got problems  what every other taxpayer gets. I got problems with the IRS, but so do a lot of people out there. I think Ive paid too much. Nothing ethical. Id like to get some money back.",1984-10-11,Republican,145
486,Bush,"No, I think Ive said all I want to say. I do, I didnt fully address myself to Mr. Boyds question no disclosure, I led the fight, I think, in 1968, in the House  I was in the House of Representatives for a couple of terms  and I led the fight for disclosure. I believe in it. Before I went into this job, I disclosed everything we had. We didnt have any private corporations, but I disclosed absolutely everything. Arthur Andersen made out an assets and liabilities statement that I believe went further than any other one. And then, to protect the public interest, we went into this blind trust. I believe in the blind trust because I believe a public official in this kind of job ought not to know whether hes gonna benefit, directly or indirectly, by some holding he might have or something of that nature. And, no, I support full disclosure.",1984-10-11,Republican,155
489,Bush,"Terrorism is very, very difficult to slop. And I think everybody knows that. We had ambassadors killed in Sudan and the Lebanon some time ago, a long time ago. When you see the Israeli building in Lebanon after the death of our marines you see that, hit by terrorism, the Israelis, with all their experience fighting terrorism, you know its difficult. When you see Khomeini wraith his radical Islam resorting to government-sponsored terrorism, its very difficult. The intelligence business can do a good job, and Im always one that defends the Central Intelligence Agency. I believe we ought to strengthen it and I believe we still have the best foreign intelligence business in the world. But it is very difficult to get the source information that you need to go after something as shadowy as international terror. There was a difference between Iran and what happened in Lebanon. In Iran you had a government holding a U.S. embassy; the government sanctioning the takeover of that embassy by those students; the government negotiating with the United States government for their release. In Lebanon, in the terror that happened at the embassy, you have the government there, Mr. Gemayel, that wants to help fight against terrorism. But because of the melee in the Middle East, its there today and has been there yesterday and the day before, and everyone thats had experience in that area knows, it is a very different thing. So what weve got to do is use absolutely the best security possible. I dont think you can go assigning blame. The president, of course, is the best Ive ever seen at accepting that. Hes been wonderful about it in absolutely everything that happens. But I think fair-minded people that really understand international terror know that its very hard to guard against. And the answer then really lies in the Middle East and terrorism happening all over the world, is a solution to the Palestine question, the follow on to Camp David under the umbrella of the Reagan September of 1982 initiative. That will reduce terror, it wont eliminate it.",1984-10-11,Republican,350
491,Bush,"What weve done is to support Arab stores that want to stand up against international terror, quite different. We believe in supporting, without jeopardizing the security of Israel in any way, because they are our one strategic ally in the area, they are the one democracy in the area and our relations with them has never been better. But we do believe in reaching out to the, what they call the GCC, those Gulf Cooperative Council State, those moderate Arab states in that world, and helping them with defensive weapons to guard against international terror or radical Islam perpetuated by Khomeini. And because weve done that and because the Saudis chopped down a couple of those intruding airplanes a while back, I think we have helped keep the peace in the Persian Gulf.",1984-10-11,Republican,133
497,Bush,"Well, Im surprised. I think I just heard Mrs. Ferraro say that she would do away with all covert actions, and if so, that has very serious ramifications, as the intelligence community knows. This is serious business. And sometimes its quiet support for a friend, and so Ill leave that one there. But let me help you with the difference, Mrs. Ferraro, between Iran and the embassy in Lebanon. Iran  we were held by a foreign government. In Lebanon you had a wanton, terrorist action where the government opposed it. We went to Lebanon to give peace a chance, to stop the bombing of civilians in Beirut, to remove 13,000 terrorists from Lebanon  and we did. We saw the formation of a government of reconciliation and for somebody to suggest, as our two opponents have, that these men died in shame  they better not tell the parents of those young marines. They gave peace a chance. And our allies were with us  the British, the French, and the Italians.",1984-10-11,Republican,169
508,Bush,"I support what were doing. It was supported to the Congress and under the law. I support it. My only regret is that the aid for the contras, those people that are fighting, we call them freedom fighters. They want to see the democracy perfected in Nicaragua. Am I to understand from this assault on covert action that nowhere in the world would we do something that was considered just off base when Mrs. Ferraro said shes never support it? Would she never support it if the violation of human rights was so great and quiet support was necessary for freedom fighters? Yes, were for the contras. And let me tell you another fact about the controls. Everyone thats not for this, everyone who wants to let that Sandinista government prevail, just like that Castro did, all of that, the contras are not Somozistas. Less than 5 percent of the contras supported Somoza. These were people that wanted a revolution. These people that felt the revolution was betrayed. These are people that support human rights. Yes, we should support them.",1984-10-11,Republican,180
512,Bush,"Well, I would simply like to make the distinction again between those countries that are searching for democracy and the handful of countries that have totally violated human rights and are going the Marxist route. Ortega, the commandante who is head of the Nicaraguan Sandinistas, is an avowed Marxist. They dont believe in the church. They dont believe in free elections. They dont believe in all of the values that we believe in. So it is our policy to support the democracy there, and when you have freedom fighters that want to protect that revolution, and go the democratic route, we believe in giving them support. We are for democracy in the hemisphere. We are for negotiations. $3 out of every $4 that we sent down there has been for economic aid to support the peoples chance to eat and live and be happy and enjoy life. And one-fourth only was rnilitary. You wouldnt get that from listening to Mr. Mondale.",1984-10-11,Republican,161
515,Bush,"Yes, I can. The, you mentioned the Gromyko meeting, those were broken off under the Carter-Mondale days. There had been three separate Soviet leaders. Mr. Brezhnev, Mr. Andropov, and now Chernenko. During their, that, in three and a half years, three separate leaders. The Soviets have not been willing to talk. We are the ones that went to the table in INF. We had a good proposal, a moral proposal. Ban an entire generation of intermediate nuclear force weapons and if you wont do that, dont leave your allies in Europe in a monopoly position. The Soviets with 1,200 of these things, and the alliance with none. We didnt think thats the way to deter aggression and keep the peace. The president went, the first thing he did when he came into office was make a proposal on the most destabilizing weapons of all, START. And when the the strategic weapon and when the Soviets said, well, we dont like that proposal, we said all right, well be more flexible. I at the urging of the president went to Geneva and laid on the table a treaty to ban all chemical weapons. We dont want them to have a monopoly. We said look, lets come together. You come over here and see what were doing; well go over there and see what youre doing. But lets save the kids of this world from chemical weapons. A brilliant proposal to get rid of all of them. And the Soviets nyet, nyet nyet. In the mutual balance force reduction to reduce conventional forces, theyre not even willing to tell us the base. Mrs. Ferraro knows that, and how many troops they have. Theres four sessions. We have had an agreement with them on the hot line. But Carter-Monad made an agreement, the Salt II agreement, but the Democratic Senate, they were a Democratic administration, the Democratic Senate wouldnt even ratify that agreement. It was flawed, it was unverifiable and it was not good. Our president wants to reduce, not just to stop, he wants to reduce dramatically nuclear weapons. And when the Soviets know theyre going to have this strong president to deal with, and when this new administration, Mr. Chernenko, given more than a few months in office can solidify its position, then theyll talk. But if they think the opposition, before they sit down, are going to give up the MX, give up the B-l, go for a freeze that locks in inferiority in Europe, all of these things, unilaterally, before theyre willing to talk, they may just sweat it out for four more weeks. Who knows.",1984-10-11,Republican,437
517,Bush,"No, I dont think its winnable. I was quoted wrong, obviously, cause I never thought that. The Soviet planning, I did learn that when I was director of Central Intelligence, and I dont think thered be any disagreement, is based on that ugly concept. But I agree with the president: It should never be fought. Nuclear weapons should never be fought with, and thats our approach. So, therefore, lets encourage the Soviets to come to the table as we did at the Gromyko meeting. I wish everybody could have seen that one  the President, giving the facts to Gromyko in all of these nuclear meetings  excellent, right on top of that subject matter. And Ill bet you that Gromyko went back to the Soviet Union saying, Hey, listen, this president is calling the shots; wed better move. But do you know why I think well get an agreement? Because I think it is in the interest of the Soviet Union to make it, just as it is in the United States. Theyre not deterred by rhetoric. I listened to the rhetoric for two years at the United Nations. Ive lived in a Communist country. Its not rhetoric that decides agreements, its self-interest of those countries.",1984-10-11,Republican,205
521,Bush,"Well, I think theres quite a difference between Mr. Kyprianou in Cyprus and the leader of the free world, Ronald Reagan, in terms of meeting. And the Soviet Union  the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union will meet with a lot of different people. Weve been in very close touch with Mr. Mitterrand, Mr. Kohl, and others that have met with the leaders of the Soviet Union. But thats quite different than meeting with the president of the United States. The Soviets say well have a meeting when we think there can be progress and yet they left those talks. Id like to correct my opponent on the walk in the woods. It was the Soviet Union that was unwilling to discuss the walk in the woods. They were the ones that gunned it down first and the record is very, very clear on that. Miss Ferraro mentioned the inflexibility of our position on strategic arms. Yes, we offered first to get rid of all those  we tried to reduce the SS-18s and those weapons. But then we said if thats not good enough, there is flexibility, lets talk about the bombers and planes. So thats a very important point in terms of negotiation.",1984-10-11,Republican,203
537,Bush,"No, I think his strategy not only was correct but is correct. Youve got to go back where we were. Clearly, when we came into office, the American people recognized that we had slipped into positions of inferiority on various things. Some of our planes, as the president points out, were older than the pilots; ships that couldnt go out to sea. And you had a major problem with the military. Actually, the morale wasnt very good either. So we have had to strengthen the military and were well on the way to getting that job done. America is back in terms of military strength, in terms of our ability to deter aggression and keep the peace. At the same time, however, we have made proposals and proposals and proposals  sound proposals  on reducing nuclear weapons. The Strategic Arms Reduction Talks were good proposals, and its the Soviets who left the table. The Intermediate Nuclear Force Talks were sound talks, and I wish the Soviet Union had continued them. The chemical weapon treaty to ban all chemical weapons, it was our initiative, not the Soviets. And we wish they would think anew and move forward to verification so everybody would know whether the other side was keeping its word. But, much more important, youd reduce the level of terror. Similarly, were reducing  trying to talk to them, and are talking to them, in Vienna, about conventional force reduction. Weve talked to them about human rights. Ive met with Mr. Andropov and Mr. Chernenko, and we mention and we try to do something about the human rights question. The suppression of Soviet Jews is absolutely intolerable and so we have to keep pushing forward on the moral grounds as well as on the arms reduction ground. But it is my view that because this president has been strong, and because weve addressed the imbalances  and I think were very close to getting that job done  the Soviets are more likely to make a deal. The Soviets made an ABM treaty when they felt we were going to deploy an ABM system. So I am optimistic for the future, once they realize that they will have this strong, principled president to negotiate with, strong leadership, and yet with demonstrable flexibility on arms control.",1984-10-11,Republican,381
539,Bush,"I have none Id like to ask of her, but Id sure like to use the time to talk about the World Series or something of that nature. Let me put it this way  I dont have any questions, but we are so different from  the Reagan-Bush administration is so different from the Carter-Mondale [sic] administration that the American people are going to have the clearest choice. Its a question of going back to the failed ideas of the past, where we came in  21% percent on those interest rates, inflation, despair, malaise, no leadership, blaming the American people for failed leadership. Or another option  keep this recovery going until it benefits absolutely everybody. Peace at home  peace abroad  prosperity  opportunity. Id like to hear her talk on those things, but I think the yellow light is flashing and so well leave it there.",1984-10-11,Republican,144
545,Bush,"Well, in a couple of weeks, you, the American people, will be faced, three weeks, with a choice. Its the clearest choice in some fifty years. And the choice is, do we move forward with strength and with prosperity or do we go back to weakness, despair, disrespect. Ronald Reagan and I have put our trust in the American people. Weve moved some of the power away from Washington, D.C., and put it back with the people. Were pulling together. The neighborhoods are safer cause crime is going down. Your sons and daughters are doing better in school. Test scores are going up. Theres a new opportunity lying out there in the future. Science, technology and space offering opportunity that, to everybody, all the young ones coming up. And abroad theres new leadership and respect. And Ronald Reagan is clearly the strong leader of the free world. And Ill be honest with you. Its a joy to serve with a president who does not apologize for the United States of America. Mr. Mondale, on the other hand, has one idea. Go out and tax the American people. And then he wants to repeal indexing, to wipe out the one protection that those at the lowest end of the economic scale have protecting them against being rammed into higher and higher tax brackets. We just owe our country too much to go back to that kind of an approach. Id like to say something to the young people. I started a business. I know what it is to have a dream and have a job and work hard to employ others and really to participate in the American dream. Some of you out there are finishing high school or college and some of you are starting out in the working place. And we want for you Americas greatest gift. And that is opportunity. And then, peace. Yes, I did serve in combat. I was shot down when I was a young kid, scared to death. And all that did, saw friends die, but that heightened my convictions about peace. It is absolutely essential that we guarantee the young people that they will not know the agony of war. Americas gift, opportunity and peace. Now we do have some unfinished business. We must continue to go ahead. The world is too complex to go back to vacillation and weakness. Weve too much going on to go back to the failed policies of the past. The future is too bright not to give it our best shot. Together we can go forward and lift America up to meet her greatest dreams. Thank you very much.",1984-10-11,Republican,442
796,Mr. Reagan,"I dont know what the differences might be, because I dont know what Mr. Carters policies are. I do know what he has said about mine. And Im only here to tell you that I believe with all my heart that our first priority must be world peace, and that use of force is always and only a last resort, when everything else has failed, and then only with regard to our national security. Now, I believe, also, that this meeting this mission, this responsibility for preserving the peace, which I believe is a responsibility peculiar to our country, and that we cannot shirk our responsibility as a leader of the free world because were the only ones that can do it. Therefore, the burden of maintaining the peace falls on us. And to maintain that peace requires strength. America has never gotten in a war because we were too strong. We can get into a war by letting events get out of hand, as they have in the last three and a half years under the foreign policies of this Administration of Mr. Carters, until were faced each time with a crisis. And good management in preserving the peace requires that we control the events and try to intercept before they become a crisis. I have seen four wars in my lifetime. Im a father of sons; I have a grandson. I dont ever want to see another generation of young Americans bleed their lives into sandy beachheads in the Pacific, or rice paddies and jungles in the in Asia or the muddy battlefields of Europe.",1980-10-28,Republican,267
799,Mr. Reagan,"Mr. Stone, I have submitted an economic plan that I have worked out in concert with a number of fine economists in this country, all of whom approve it, and believe that over a five year projection, this plan can permit the extra spending for needed refurbishing of our defensive posture, that it can provide for a balanced budget by 1983 if not earlier, and that we can afford  along with the cuts that I have proposed in Government. spending  we can afford the tax cuts I have proposed and probably mainly because Mr. Carters economic policy has built into the next five years, and on beyond that, a tax increase that will be taking $86 billion more out of the peoples pockets than was taken this year. And my tax cut does not come close to eliminating that $86 billion increase. Im only reducing the amount of the increase. In other words, what Im talking about is not putting government back to getting less money than governments been getting, but simply cutting the increase in in spending.",1980-10-28,Republican,178
807,Mr. Reagan,"Well yes, I question the figure about the decline in defense spending under the two previous Administrations in the preceding eight years to this Administration. I would call to your attention that we were in a war that wound down during those eight years, which of course made a change in military spending because of turning from war to peace. I also would like to point out that Republican presidents in those years, faced with a Democratic majority in both houses of the Congress, found that their requests for defense budgets were very often cut. Now, Gerald Ford left a five-year projected plan for a military build-up to restore our defenses, and President Carters administration reduced that by 38%, cut 60 ships out of the Navy building program that had been proposed, and stopped the the B-l, delayed the cruise missile, stopped the production line for the Minuteman missile, stopped the Trident or delayed the Trident submarine, and now is planning a mobile military force that can be delivered to various spots in the world which does make me question his assaults on whether I am the one who is quick to look for use of force.",1980-10-28,Republican,197
817,Mr. Reagan,"Mr. Ellis, I think this idea that has been spawned here in our country that inflation somehow came upon us like a plague and therefore its uncontrollable and no one can do anything about it, is entirely spurious and its dangerous to say this to the people. When Mr. Carter became President, inflation was 4.8%, as you said. It had been cut in two by President Gerald Ford. It is now running at 12.7%. President Carter also has spoken of the new jobs created. Well, we always, with the normal growth in our country and increase in population, increase the number of jobs. But that cant hide the fact that there are eight million men and women out of work in America today, and two million of those lost their jobs in just the last few months. Mr. Carter had also promised that he would not use unemployment as a tool to fight against inflation. And yet, his 1980 economic message stated that we would reduce productivity and gross national product and increase unemployment in order to get a handle on inflation, because in January, at the beginning of the year, it was more than 18%. Since then, he has blamed the people for inflation, OPEC, he has blamed the Federal Reserve system, he has blamed the lack of productivity of the American people, he has then accused the people of living too well and that we must share in scarcity, we must sacrifice and get used to doing with less. We dont have inflation because the people are living too well. We have inflation because the Government is living too well. And the last statement, just a few days ago, was a speech to the effect that we have inflation because Government revenues have not kept pace with Government spending. I see my time is running out here. Ill have to get this out very fast. Yes, you can lick inflation by increasing productivity and by decreasing the cost of government to the place that we have balanced budgets, and are no longer grinding out printing press money, flooding the market with it because the Government is spending more than it takes in. And my economic plan calls for that. The Presidents economic plan calls for increasing the taxes to the point that we finally take so much money away from the people that we can balance the budget in that way. But we will have a very poor nation and a very unsound economy if we follow that path.",1980-10-28,Republican,421
820,Mr. Reagan,"Well. most people, when they think about cutting Government spending, they think in terms of eliminating necessary programs or wiping out something, some service that Government is supposed to perform. I believe that there is enough extravagance and fat in government. As a matter of fact, one of the secretaries of HEW under Mr. Carter testified that he thought there was $7 billion worth of fraud and waste in welfare and in the medical programs associated with it. Weve had the Central Accounting. Office estimate that there is probably tens of billions of dollars that is lost in fraud alone, and they have added that waste adds even more to that. We have a program for a gradual reduction of Government spending based on these theories, and I have a task force now that has been working on where those cuts could be made. Im confident that it can be done and that it will reduce inflation because I did it in California. And inflation went down below the national average in California when we returned the money to the people and reduced Government spending.",1980-10-28,Republican,185
826,Mr. Reagan,"Yes. The figures that the President has just used about California is a distortion of the situation there, because while I was Governor of California, our spending in California increased less per capita than the spending in Georgia while Mr. Carter was Governor of Georgia in the same four years. The size of government increased only one-sixth in California of what it increased in proportion to the population in Georgia. And the idea that my tax-cut proposal is inflationary: I would like to ask the President why is it inflationary to let the people keep more of their money and spend it the way that they like, and it isnt inflationary to let him take that money and spend it the way he wants?",1980-10-28,Republican,124
828,Mr. Reagan,"I have been talking to a number of Congressmen who have much the same idea that I have, and that is that in the inner city areas, that in cooperation with the local government and the national Government, and using tax incentives and with cooperating with the private sector, that we have development zones. Let the local entity, the city, declare this particular area, based on the standards of the percentage of people on welfare, unemployed, and so forth, in that area. And then, through tax incentives, induce the creation of businesses providing jobs and so forth in those areas. The elements of government through these tax incentives For example, a business that would not have, for a period of time, an increase in the property tax reflecting its development of the unused property that it was making wouldnt be any loss to the city because the city isnt getting any tax from that now. And there would simply be a delay, and on the other hand, many of the people who would then be given jobs are presently wards of the Government and it wouldnt hurt to give them a tax incentive, because they that wouldnt be costing Government anything either. I think there are things to do in this regard. I stood in the South Bronx on the exact spot that President Carter stood on in 1977. You have to see it to believe it. It looks like a bombed-out city  great, gaunt skeletons of buildings. Windows smashed out, painted on one of them Unkept promises; on another, Despair. And this was the spot at which President Carter had promised that he was going to bring in a vast program to rebuild this department. There are whole or this area there are whole blocks of land that are left bare, just bulldozed down flat. And nothing has been done, and they are now charging to take tourists there to see this terrible desolation. I talked to a man just briefly there who asked me one simple question: Do I have reason to hope that I can someday take care of my family again? Nothing has been done.",1980-10-28,Republican,359
831,Mr. Reagan,"I believe in it. I am eternally optimistic, and I happen to believe that weve made great progress from the days when I was young and when this country didnt even know it had a racial problem. I know those things can grow out of despair in an inner city, when theres hopelessness at home, lack of work, and so forth. But I believe that all of us together, and I believe the Presidency is what Teddy Roosevelt said it was. Its a bully pulpit. And I think that something can be done from there, because a goal for all of us should be that one day, things will be done neither because of nor in spite of any of the differences between us  ethnic differences or racial differences, whatever they may be  that we will have total equal opportunity for all people. And I would do everything I could in my power to bring that about.",1980-10-28,Republican,157
839,Mr. Reagan,"Yes. The President talks of Government programs, and they have their place. But as governor, when I was at that end of the line and receiving some of these grants for Government programs, I saw that so many of them were dead-end. They were public employment that these people who really want to get out into the private job market where there are jobs with a future. Now, the President spoke a moment ago about that I was against the minimum wage. I wish he could have been with me when I sat with a group of teenagers who were black, and who were telling me about their unemployment problems, and that it was the minimum wage that had done away with the jobs that they once could get. And indeed, every time it has increased you will find there is an increase in minority unemployment among young people. And therefore, I have been in favor of a separate minimum for them. With regard to the great progress that has been made with this Government spending, the rate of black unemployment in Detroit, Michigan, is 56%.",1980-10-28,Republican,186
850,Mr. Reagan,"Barbara, youve asked that question twice. I think you ought to have at least one answer to it. I have been accused lately of having a secret plan with regard to the hostages. Now, this comes from an answer that Ive made at least 50 times during this campaign to the press, when I am asked have you any ideas of what you would do if you were there? And I said, well, yes. And I think that anyone thats seeking this position, as well as other people, probably, have thought to themselves, what about this, what about that? These are just ideas of what I would think of if I were in that position and had access to the information, and which I would know all the options that were open to me. I have never answered the question, however; second, the one that says, well, tell me, what are some of those ideas? First of all, I would be fearful that I might say something that was presently under way or in negotiations, and thus expose it and endanger the hostages, and sometimes, I think some of my ideas might require quiet diplomacy where you dont say in advance, or say to anyone, what it is youre thinking of doing. Your question is difficult to answer, because, in the situation right now, no one wants to say anything that would inadvertently delay, in any way, the return of those hostages if there if there is a chance that theyre coming home soon, or that might cause them harm. What I do think should be done, once they are safely here with their families, and that tragedy is over  weve endured this humiliation for just lacking one week of a year now  then, I think, it is time for us to have a complete investigation as to the diplomatic efforts that were made in the beginning, why they have been there so long, and when they came home, what did we have to do in order to bring that about  what arrangements were made? And I would suggest that Congress should hold such an investigation. In the meantime, Im going to continue praying that theyll carne home.",1980-10-28,Republican,368
853,Mr. Reagan,"The degree of unpopularity of a regime when the choice is total authoritarianism totalitarianism, I should say, in the alternative government, makes one wonder whether you are being helpful to the people. And weve been guilty of that. Because someone didnt meet exactly our standards of human rights, even though they were an ally of ours, instead of trying patiently to persuade them to change their ways, we have, in a number of instances, aided a revolutionary overthrow which results in complete totalitarianism, instead, for those people. I think that this is a kind of a hypocritical policy when, at the same time, were maintaining a detente with the one nation in the world where there are no human rights at all  the Soviet Union. Now, there was a second phase in the Iranian affair in which we had something to do with that. And that was, we had adequate warning that there was a threat to our embassy, and we could have done what other embassies did  either strengthen our security there, or remove our personnel before the kidnap and the takeover took place.",1980-10-28,Republican,185
857,Mr. Reagan,"Yes. I have no quarrel whatsoever with the things that have been done, because I believe it is high time that the civilized countries of the world made it plain that there is no room worldwide for terrorism; there will be no negotiation with terrorists of any kind. And while I have a last word here, I would like to correct a misstatement of fact by the President. I have never made the statement that he suggested about nuclear proliferation and nuclear proliferation, or the trying to halt it, would be a major part of a foreign policy of mine.",1980-10-28,Republican,100
860,Mr. Reagan,"Yes. I think Im right because I believe that we must have a consistent foreign policy, a strong America, and a strong economy. And then, as we build up our national security, to restore our margin of safety, we at the same time try to restrain the Soviet build-up, which has been going forward at a rapid pace, and for quite some time. The SALT II treaty was the result of negotiations that Mr. Carters team entered into after he had asked the Soviet Union for a discussion of actual reduction of nuclear strategic weapons. And his emissary, I think, came home in 12 hours having heard a very definite nyet. But taking that one no from the Soviet Union, we then went back into negotiations on their terms, because Mr. Carter had canceled the B-I bomber, delayed the MX, delayed the Trident submarine, delayed the cruise missile, shut down the Missile Man  the three  the Minuteman missile production line, and whatever other things that might have been done. The Soviet Union sat at the table knowing that we had gone forward with unilateral concessions without any reciprocation from them whatsoever. Now, I have not blocked the SALT II treaty, as Mr. Carter and Mr. Mondale suggest I have. It has been blocked by a Senate in which there is a Democratic majority. Indeed, the Senate Armed Services Committee voted 10 to 0, with seven abstentions, against the SALT II treaty, and declared that it was not in the national security interests of the United States. Besides which, it is illegal, because the law of the land, passed by Congress, says that we cannot accept a treaty in which we are not equal. And we are not equal in this treaty for one reason alone  our B-2 bombers are considered to be strategic weapons; their Backfire bombers are not.",1980-10-28,Republican,309
868,Mr. Reagan,"I know the Presidents supposed to be replying to me, but sometimes, I have a hard time in connecting what hes saying, with what I have said or what my positions are. I sometimes think hes like the witch doctor that gets mad when a good doctor comes along with a cure thatll work. My point I have made already, Mr. President, with regard to negotiating: it does not call for nuclear superiority on the part of the United States. It calls for a mutual reduction of these weapons, as I say, that neither of us can represent a threat to the other. And to suggest that the SALT II treaty that your negotiators negotiated was just a continuation, and based on all of the preceding efforts by two previous Presidents, is just not true. It was a new negotiation because, as I say, President Ford was within about 10% of having a solution that could be acceptable. And I think our allies would be very happy to go along with a fair and verifiable SALT agreement.",1980-10-28,Republican,177
876,Mr. Reagan,"Im not so sure that it means steadily higher fuel costs, but I do believe that this nation has been portrayed for too long a time to the people as being energy-poor when it is energy-rich. The coal that the President mentioned  yes, we have it  and yet one-eighth of our total coal resources is not being utilized at all right now. The mines are closed down; there are 22000 miners out of work. Most of this is due to regulations which either interfere with the mining of it or prevent the burning of it:. With our modern technology, yes, we can burn our coal within the limits of the Clean Air Act. I think, as technology improves, well be able to do even better with that. The other thing is that we have only leased out  begun to explore  2% of our outer continental shelf for oil, where it is believed, by everyone familiar with that fuel and that source of energy, that there are vast supplies yet to be found. Our Government has, in the last year or so, taken out of multiple use millions of acres of public lands that once were  well, they were public lands subject to multiple use  exploration for minerals and so forth. It is believed that probably 70% of the potential oil in the United States is probably hidden in those lands, and no one is allowed to even go and explore to find out if it is there. This is particularly true of the recent efforts to shut down part of Alaska. Nuclear power: There were 36 power plants planned in this country. And let me add the word safety; it must be done with the utmost of safety. But 32 of those have given up and canceled their plans to build, and again, because Government regulations and permits, and so forth, take  make it take  more than twice as long to build a nuclear plant in the United States as it does to build one in Japan or in Western Europe. We have the sources here. We are energy rich, and coal is one of the great potentials we have.",1980-10-28,Republican,360
880,Mr. Reagan,"That is a misstatement, of course, of my position. I just happen to believe that free enterprise can do a better job of producing the things that people need than government can. The Department of Energy has a multi-billion-dollar budget in excess of $10 billion. It hasnt produced a quart of oil or a lump of coal, or anything else in the line of energy. And for Mr. Carter to suggest that I want to do away with the safety laws and with the laws that pertain to clean water and clean air, and so forth. As Governor of California, I took charge of passing the strictest air pollution laws in the United States  the strictest air quality law that has even been adopted in the United States. And we created an OSHA  an Occupational Safety and Health Agency  for the protection of employees before the Federal Government had one in place. And to this day, not one of its decisions or rulings has ever been challenged. So, I think some of those charges are missing the point. I am suggesting that there are literally thousands of unnecessary regulations that invade every facet of business, and indeed, very much of our personal lives, that are unnecessary; that Government can do without; that have added $130 billion to the cost of production in this country; and that are contributing their part to inflation. And I would like to see us a little more free, as we once were.",1980-10-28,Republican,247
884,Mr. Reagan,"Yes. If it is a well-known fact that I opposed air pollution laws in California, the only thing I can possibly think of is that the President must be suggesting the law that the Federal Government tried to impose on the State of California  not a law, but regulations  that would have made it impossible to drive an automobile within the city limits of any California city, or to have a place to put it if you did drive it against their regulations. It would have destroyed the economy of California, and, I must say, we had the support of Congress when we pointed out how ridiculous this attempt was by the Environmental Protection Agency. We still have the strictest air control, or air pollution laws in the country. As for offshore oiling, only 2% now is so leased and is producing oil. The rest, as to whether the lands are going to be opened in the next five years or so  were already five years behind in what we should be doing. There is more oil now, in the wells that have been drilled, than has been taken out in 121 years that theyve been drilled.",1980-10-28,Republican,197
887,Mr. Reagan,"The Social Security system was based on a false premise, with regard to how fast the number of workers would increase and how fast the number of retirees would increase. It is actuarially out of balance, and this first became evident about 16 years ago, and some of us were voicing warnings then. Now, it is trillions of dollars out of balance, and the only answer that has come so far is the biggest single tax increase in our nations history  the payroll tax increase for Social Security  which will only put a band-aid on this and postpone the day of reckoning by a few years at most. What is needed is a study that I have proposed by a task force of experts to look into this entire problem as to how it can be reformed and made actuarially sound, but with the premise that no one presently dependent on Social Security is going to have the rug pulled out from under them and not get their check. We cannot frighten, as we have with the threats and the campaign rhetoric that has gone on in this campaign, our senior citizens  leave them thinking that in some way, theyre endangered and they would have no place to turn. They must continue to get those checks, and I believe that the system can be put on a sound actuarial basis. But its going to take some study and some work, and not just passing a tax increase to let the load  or the roof  fall in on the next administration.",1980-10-28,Republican,260
892,Mr. Reagan,"Well, that just isnt true. It has, as I said, delayed the actuarial imbalance falling on us for just a few years with that increase in taxes, and I dont believe we can go on increasing the tax, because the problem for the young people today is that they are paying in far more than they can ever expect to get out. Now, again this statement that somehow, I wanted to destroy it and I just changed my tune, that I am for voluntary Social Security, which would mean the ruin of it. Mr. President, the voluntary thing that I suggested many years ago was that with a young man orphaned and raised by an aunt who died, his aunt was ineligible for Social Security insurance because she was not his mother. And I suggested that if this is an insurance program, certainly the person who is paying in should be able to name his own beneficiary. That is the closest I have ever come to anything voluntary with Social Security. I, too, am pledged to a Social Security program that will reassure these senior citizens of ours that they are going to continue to get their money. There are some changes that I would like to make. I would like to make a change in the regulation that discriminates against a wife who works and finds that she then is faced with a choice between her fathers or her husbands benefits, if he dies first, or what she has paid in; but it does not recognize that she has also been paying in herself, and she is entitled to more than she presently can get. Id like to change that.",1980-10-28,Republican,281
896,Mr. Reagan,"When I opposed Medicare, there was another piece of legislation meeting the same problem before the Congress. I happened to favor the other piece of legislation and thought that it would be better for the senior citizens and provide better care than the one that was finally passed. I was not opposing the principle of providing care for them. I was opposing one piece of legislation versus another. There is something else about Social Security. Of course, it doesnt come out of the payroll tax. It comes out of a general fund, but something should be done about it. I think it is disgraceful that the Disability Insurance Fund in Social Security finds checks going every month to tens of thousands of people who are locked up in our institutions for crime or for mental illness, and they are receiving disability checks from Social Security every month while a state institution provides for all of their needs and their care.",1980-10-28,Republican,160
904,Mr. Reagan,"Well, Barbara, I believe that there is a fundamental difference  and I think it has been evident in most of the answers that Mr. Carter has given tonight  that he seeks the solution to anything as another opportunity for a Federal Government program. I happen to believe that the Federal Government has usurped powers of autonomy and authority that belong back at the state and local level. It has imposed on the individual freedoms of the people, and there are more of these things that could be solved by the people themselves, if they were given a chance, or by the levels of government that were closer to them. Now, as to why I should be and he shouldnt be, when he was a candidate in 1976, President Carter invented a thing he called the misery index. He added the rate of unemployment and the rate of inflation, and it came, at that time, to 12.5% under President Ford. He said that no man with that size misery index has a right to seek reelection to the Presidency. Today, by his own decision, the misery index is in excess of 20%, and I think this must suggest something. But, when I had quoted a Democratic President, as the President says, I was a Democrat. I said many foolish things back in those days. But the President that I quoted had made a promise, a Democratic promise, and I quoted him because it was never kept. And today, you would find that that promise is at the very heart of what Republicanism represents in this country today. Thats why I believe there are going to be millions of Democrats that are going to vote with us this time around, because they too want that promise kept. It was a promise for less government and less taxes and more freedom for the people.",1980-10-28,Republican,311
908,Mr. Reagan,"Yes. Mr. President, once again, I happen to be against the amendment, because I think the amendment will take this problem out of the hands of elected legislators and put it in the hands f unelected judges. I am for equal rights, and while you have been in office for four ears and not one single state  and most f them have a majority of Democratic legislators  has added to the ratification r voted to ratify the equal rights amendment. While I was Governor, more than eight years ago, I found 14 separate instances where women were discriminated against in the body of California law, and I had passed and signed into law 14 statutes that eliminated those discriminations, including the economic ones that you have just mentioned  equal pay and so forth. I believe that if in all these years that we have spent trying to get the amendment, that we had spent as much time correcting these laws, as we did in California  and we were the first to do it. If I were President, I would also now take a look at the hundreds of Federal regulations which discriminate against women and which go right on while everyone is looking for an amendment. I would have someone ride herd on those regulations, and we would start eliminating those discriminations in the Federal Government against women.",1980-10-28,Republican,228
912,Mr. Reagan,"Well, my last word is again to say this: We were talking about this very simple amendment and womens rights. And I make it plain again: I am for womens rights. But I would like to call the attention of the people to the fact that that so-called simple amendment would be used by mischievous men to destroy discriminations that properly belong, by law, to women respecting the physical differences between the two sexes, labor laws that protect them against things that would be physically harmful to them. Those would all, could all be challenged by men. And the same would be true with regard to combat service in the military and so forth. I thought that was the subject we were supposed to be on. But, if were talking about how much we think about the working people and so forth, Im the only fellow who ever ran for this job who was six times President of his own union and still has a lifetime membership in that union.",1980-10-28,Republican,170
916,Mr. Reagan,"Yes, I would like to add my words of thanks, too, to the ladies of the League of Women Voters for making these debates possible. Im sorry that we couldnt persuade the bringing in of the third candidate, so that he could have been seen also in these debates. But still, its good that at least once, all three of us were heard by the people of this country. Next Tuesday is Election Day. Next Tuesday all of you will go to the polls, will stand there in the polling place and make a decision. I think when you make that decision, it might be well if you would ask yourself, are you better off than you were four years ago? Is it easier for you to go and buy things in the stores than it was four years ago? Is there more or less unemployment in the country than there was four years ago? Is America as respected throughout the world as it was? Do you feel that our security is as safe, that were as strong as we were four years ago? And if you answer all of those questions yes, why then, I think your choice is very obvious as to whom you will vote for. If you dont agree, if you dont think that this course that weve been on for the last four years is what you would like to see us follow for the next four, then I could suggest another choice that you have. This country doesnt have to be in the shape that it is in. We do not have to go on sharing in scarcity with the country getting worse off, with unemployment growing. We talk about the unemployment lines. If all of the unemployed today were in a single line allowing two feet for each of them, that line would reach from New York City to Los Angeles, California. All of this can be cured and all of it can be solved. I have not had the experience the President has had in holding that office, but I think in being Governor of California, the most populous state in the Union  if it were a nation, it would be the seventh-ranking economic power in the world  I, too, had some lonely moments and decisions to make. I know that the economic program that I have proposed for this nation in the next few years can resolve many of the problems that trouble us today. I know because we did it there. We cut the cost  the increased cost of government  in half over the eight years. We returned $5.7 billion in tax rebates, credits and cuts to our people. We, as I have said earlier, fell below the national average in inflation when we did that. And I know that we did give back authority and autonomy to the people. I would like to have a crusade today, and I would like to lead that crusade with your help. And it would be one to take Government off the backs of the great people of this country, and turn you loose again to do those things that I know you can do so well, because you did them and made this country great. Thank you.",1980-10-28,Republican,545
1963,Mr. Ford,"Governor Carter again is talking in broad generalities. Let me take just one question that he raises  the military strength and capability of the United States. Governor Carter in November of 1975 indicated that he wanted to cut the defense budget by $15 billion. A few months later, he said he wanted to cut the defense budget by eight or nine billion dollars. And more recently, he talks about cutting the defense budget by five to seven billion dollars. There is no way you can be strong militarily and have those kind of reductions in our military uh  appropriation. Now let me just tell you a little story. About uh  late October of 1975, I asked the then Secretary of Defense, Mr. Schlesinger, to tell me what had to be done if we were going to reduce the defense budget by uh  three to five billion dollars. A few days later, Mr. Schlesinger came back and said if we cut the defense budget by three to five billion dollars, we will have to cut military personnel by two hundred and fifty thousand, civilian personnel by a hundred thousand, jobs in America by a hundred thousand. We would have to stretch out our aircraft procurement, we would have to reduce our naval construction program, we would have to reduce the uh  research and development for the Army, the Navy, the Air Force and Marines by 8 percent. We would have to close twenty military bases in the United States immediately. Thats the kind of defense program that uh  Mr. Carter wants. Let me tell you this straight from the shoulder. You dont negotiate with Mr. Brezhnev from weakness. And the kind of defense program that Mr. Carter wants will mean a weaker defense and a poor negotiating position.",1976-10-06,Republican,297
1966,Mr. Ford,"I dont believe we should move to a cold-war relationship. I think its in the best interest of the United States, and the world as a whole that the United States negotiate rather than go back to the cold-war relationship with the Soviet Union. I dont uh  look at the picture as bleakly as you have indicated in your question, Mr. Trewhitt. I believe that the United States ha- had many successes in recent years, in recent months, as far as the Communist movement is concerned. We have been successful in Portugal, where a year ago it looked like there was a very great possibility that the uh  Communists would take over in Portugal. It didnt happen. We have a democracy in Portugal today. A few uh  months ago, or I should say, maybe two years ago, the Soviet Union looked like they had continued strength in the Middle East. Today, according to Prime Minister Rabin, the Soviet Union is weaker in the Middle East than they have been in many, many years. The facts are, there  the Soviet Union relationship with Egypt is uh  at a low level. The Soviet Union relationship with Syria is at a very low point. The United States today, according to Prime Minister Rabin of Israel, is a- at a peak in its uh  influence and power in the Middle East. But lets turn for a minute to the uhh  southern African operations that are now going on. The United States of America took the initiative in southern Africa. We wanted to end the bloodshed in southern Africa. We wanted to have the right of self-determination in southern Africa. We wanted to have majority rule with the full protection of the rights of the minority. We wanted to preserve human dignity in southern Africa. We have taken the initiative, and in southern Africa today the United States is trusted by the black front-line nations and black Africa. The United States is trusted by other elements in southern Africa. The United States foreign policy under this administration has been one of progress and success. And I believe that instead of talking about Soviet progress, we can talk about American successes. And may I make an observation  part of the question you asked, Mr. Trewhitt? I dont believe that its in the best interest of the United States and the NATO nations to have a Communist government in NATO. Mr. Carter has indicated he would look with sympathy to a Communist government in NATO. I think that would destroy the integrity and the strength of NATO, and I am totally opposed to it.",1976-10-06,Republican,437
1974,Mr. Ford,"Governor Carter again contradicts himself. He complains about secrecy and yet he is quoted as saying that in the attempt to find a solution in the Middle East that he would hold unpublicized meetings with the Soviet Union  I presume for the purpose of an  imposing a settlement on Israel and the Arab nations. But let me talk just a minute about what weve done to avoid secrecy in the Ford administration. After the United States took the initiative in working with Israel and with Egypt and achieving the Sinai II agreement  and Im proud to say that not a single Egyptian or Israeli soldier has lost his life since the signing of the Sinai agreement. But at the time that uh  I submitted the Sinai agreement to the Congress of the United States, I submitted every single document that was applicable to the Sinai II agreement. It was the most complete documentation by any president of any agreement signed by a president on behalf of the United States. Now as far as meeting with the Congress is concerned, during the twenty-four months that Ive been the president of the United States I have averaged better than one meeting a month with responsible groups or committees of the Congress  both House and Senate. The secretary of state has appeared in the several years that hes been the secretary before eighty different uh  committee hearings in the House and in the Senate. The secretary of state has made better than fifty speeches all over the United States explaining American foreign policy. I have made myself at least ten uh  speeches in various parts of the country where I have discussed with the American people defense and foreign policy.",1976-10-06,Republican,287
1977,Mr. Ford,"I believe that we have uh  negotiated with the Soviet Union since Ive been president from a position of strength. And let me cite several examples. Shortly after I became president in uh  December of 1974, I met with uh  General Secretary Brezhnev in Vladivostok and we agreed to a mutual cap on the ballistic missile launchers at a ceiling of twenty-four hundred  which means that the Soviet Union, if that becomes a permanent agreement, will have to make a reduction in their launchers that they now have or plan to have. Ive negotiated at Vladivostok with uh  Mr. Brezhnev a limitation on the MIRVing of their ballistic missiles at a figure of thirteen-twenty, which is the first time that any president has achieved a cap either on launchers or on MIRVs. It seems to me that we can go from there to uh  the uh  grain sales. The grain sales have been a benefit to American agriculture. We have achieved a five and three quarter year uh  sale of a minimum six million metric tons, which means that they have already bought about four million metric tons this year and are bound to buy another two million metric tons to take the grain and corn and wheat that the American farmers have produced in order to uh  have full production. And these grain sales to the Soviet Union have helped us tremendously in meeting the costs of the additional oil and  the oil that we have bought from overseas. If we turn to Helsinki  Im glad you raised it, Mr. uh  Frankel. In the case of Helsinki, thirty-five nations signed an agreement, including the secretary of state for the Vatican  I cant under any circumstances believe that the  His Holiness, the Pope would agree by signing that agreement that the thirty-five nations have turned over to the Warsaw Pact nations the domination of the  Eastern Europe. It just isnt true. And if Mr. Carter alleges that His Holiness by signing that has done it, he is totally inaccurate. Now, what has been accomplished by the Helsinki agreement? Number one, we have an agreement where they notify us and we notify them of any uh  military maneuvers that are to be be undertaken. They have done it. In both cases where theyve done so, there is no Soviet domination of Eastern Europe and there never will be under a Ford administration.",1976-10-06,Republican,401
1980,Mr. Ford,"I dont believe, uh  Mr. Frankel that uh  the Yugoslavians consider themselves dominated by the Soviet Union. I dont believe that the Rumanians consider themselves dominated by the Soviet Union. I dont believe that the Poles consider themselves dominated by the Soviet Union. Each of those countries is independent, autonomous: it has its own territorial integrity and the United States does not concede that those countries are under the domination of the Soviet Union. As a matter of fact, I visited Poland, Yugoslavia and Rumania to make certain that the people of those countries understood that the president of the United States and the people of the United are dedicated to their independence, their autonomy and their freedom.",1976-10-06,Republican,118
1989,Mr. Ford,"Governor Carter uh  apparently doesnt realize that since Ive been president we have sold to the Israelis over $4 billion in military hardware. We have made available to the Israelis over 45 percent of the total economic and military aid since the establishment of Israel twenty-seven years ago. So the Ford administration has done a good job in helping our good ally, Israel, and were dedicated to the survival and security of Israel. I believe that Governor Carter doesnt realize the need and necessity for arms sales to Iran. He indicates he would not make those. Iran is bordered very extensively by the Soviet Union. Iran has Iraq as one of its neighbors. The Soviet Union and the Communist-dominated government of Iraq are neighbors of Iran, and Iran is an ally of the United States. Its my strong feeling that we ought to sell arms to Iran for its own national security, and as an ally  a strong ally of the United States. The history of our relationship with Iran goes back to the days of President Truman when he decided that it was vitally necessary for our own security as well as that of Iran, that we should help that country, and Iran has been a good ally. In 1973 when there was an oil embargo, Iran did not participate. Iran continued to sell oil to the United States. I believe that its in our interest and in the interest of Israel and Iran, and Saudi Arabia, for the United States to sell arms to those countries. Its for their security as well as ours.",1976-10-06,Republican,266
1992,Mr. Ford,"Our relationship with the Peoples Republic of China is based upon the Shanghai Communique, of 1972, and that communique, calls for the normalization of relations between the United States and the Peoples Republic. It doesnt set a times schedule. It doesnt uh  make a determination as to how uh  that relationship should be achieved in relationship to our current uhh  diplomatic recognition and obligations to the Taiwanese Government. The Shanghai Communique, does say that the differences between the Peoples Republic on the one hand and Taiwan on the other shall be settled by peaceful means. The net result is this administration, and during my time as the president for the next four years, we will continue to move for normalization of relations in the traditional sense, and we will insist that the disputes between Taiwan and the Peoples Republic be settled peacefully, as was agreed in the Shanghai Communique, of 1972. The Ford administration will not let down, will not eliminate or forget our obligation to the people of Taiwan. We feel that there must be a continued obligation to the people, the some nineteen or twenty million people in Taiwan. And as we move during the next four years, those will be the policies of this administration.",1976-10-06,Republican,208
1994,Mr. Ford,"There is no policy of this government to give to the Peoples Republic, or to sell to the Peoples Republic of China, military equipment. I do not believe that we, the United States, should sell, give or otherwise transfer military hardware to the Peoples Republic of China, or any other Communist nation, such as the Soviet Union and the like.",1976-10-06,Republican,60
2003,Mr. Ford,"Let me say very categorically you cannot maintain the security of the United States with the kind of defense budget cuts that Governor Carter has indicated. In 1975 he wanted to cut the budget $15 billion. Hes now down to a figure of five to seven billion dollars. Reductions of that kind will not permit the United States to be strong enough to deter aggression and maintain the peace. Governor Carter apparently doesnt know the facts. As soon as I became president, I initiated a meeting with the NATO heads of state and met with them in Brussels to discuss how we could improve the re- defense relationship in Western Europe. In uh  November of 1975 I met with the leaders of the five industrial nations in France for the purpose of seeing what we could do acting together to meet the problems of uh  the coming recession. In Puerto Rico this year, I met with six of the leading industrial nations heads of state to meet the problem of inflation so we would be able to solve it before it got out of hand. I have met with the heads of government bilaterally as well as multilaterally. Our relations with Japan have never been better. I was the first United States president to visit Japan. And we uh  had the emperor of Japan here this uh  past year and the net result is Japan and the United States are working more closely together now than at any time in the history of our relationship. You can go around the world  and let me take Israel for example. Just recently, President Rabin said that our relations were never better.",1976-10-06,Republican,279
2006,Mr. Ford,"First we have to understand that SALT I expires October third 1977. Uh  Mr. Brezhnev and I met in Vladivostok in December of 1974 for the purpose of trying to take the initial step so we could have a SALT II agreement that would go to l985. As I indicated earlier, we did agree on a twenty-four-hundred limitation on uh  uh  launchers of ballistic missiles. Uh  that would mean a cutback in the Soviet program; it would not interfere with our own program. At the same time, we put a limitation of thirteen hundred and twenty on MIRVs. Our technicians have been working since that time in Geneva, trying to put into technical language a  an agreement that can be verified by both parties. In the meantime, there has developed the problem of the Soviet Backfire  their high-performance aircraft which they say is not a long-range aircraft and which some of our people say is a intercontinental aircraft. In the interim, there has been the development on our part primarily, the cruise missiles; cruise missiles that could be launched from land-based mobile installations; cruise missiles that could be launched  launched from high-performance aircraft, like the B-52s or the B-1s, which I hope we proceed with; cruise missiles which could be launched from either surface or submarine uh  naval vessels. Those gray-area weapons systems are creating some problems in a  the agreement for a SALT II negotiation. But I can say that I am dedicated to proceeding, and I met just last week with the foreign minister of the Soviet Union, and he indicated to me that uh  the Soviet Union was interested in narrowing the differences and making a realistic and a sound compromise. I hope and trust, in the best interest of both countries, and in the best interests of all people throughout this globe, that the Soviet Union and the United States can make a mutually beneficial agreement. Because if we do not and SALT I expires on October three, 1977, you will unleash again an all-out nuclear arms race with the potential of a nuclear holocaust of unbelievable dimensions. So its the obligation of the president to do just that, and I intend to do so.",1976-10-06,Republican,369
2008,Mr. Ford,"I believe that the cruise missiles which we are now developing in research and development across the spectrum from air, from the sea, or from the land, uh  can be uh  included within a SALT II agreement. They are a new weapons system that has a great potential, both conventional and nuclear armed. At the same time, we have to make certain that the Soviet Unions Backfire, which they claim is not an intercontinental aircraft and which some of our people contend is, must also be included if we are to get the kind of agreement which is in the best interest of both countries. And I really believe that it  its far better for us and for the Soviet Union, and more importantly for the people around the world, that these two superpowers find an answer for a SALT II agreement before October three, 1977. I think good will on both parts, hard bargaining by both parties and a reasonable compromise will be in the best interests of all parties.",1976-10-06,Republican,171
2015,Mr. Ford,"Governor Carter uh  brags about the unemployment during Democratic administrations and condemns the unemployment at the present time. I must remind him that were at peace and during the period that he brags about unemployment being low, the United States was at war. Now let me correct one other comment that uh  Governor Carter has made. I have recommended to the Congress that we develop the uranium enrichment plant at Portsmouth, Ohio, which is a publicly owned  U.S. government facility and have indicated that the private program which would follow on in Alabama is one that may or may not uhh  be constructed. But I am committed to the one at Portsmouth, Ohio. The governor also talks about morality in foreign policy. The foreign policy of the United States meets the highest standards of morality. What is more moral than peace, and the United States is at peace today? What is more moral in foreign policy than for the administration to take the lead in the World Food Conference in Rome in 1974 when the United States committed six million metric tons of food  over 60 percent of the food committed for the disadvantaged and underdeveloped nations of the world? The Ford administration wants to eradicate hunger and disease in our underdeveloped countries throughout the world. What is more moral than for the United States under the Ford administration to take the lead in southern Africa, in the Middle East? Those are initiatives in foreign policy which are of the highest moral standard and that is indicative of the foreign policy of this country.",1976-10-06,Republican,264
2018,Mr. Ford,"I believe that uh  our foreign policy must express the highest standards of morality. And the initiatives that we took in southern Africa are the best examples of what this administration is doing and will continue to do in the next four years. If the United States had not moved when we did in southern Africa, theres no doubt there would have been an acceleration of bloodshed in that tragic part of the world. If we had not taken our initiative, its very, very possible that uh  the government of Rhodesia would have been overrun and that the Soviet Union and the Cubans would have dominated uh  southern Africa. So the United States, seeking to preserve the principle of self-determination, to eliminate the possibility of bloodshed, to protect the rights of the minority as we insisted upon the rights of the majority, uh  I believe followed the good conscience of the American people in foreign policy. And I believe that we used our skill. Secretary of State Kissinger has done a superb job in working with the black African nations, the so-called front-line nations. He has done a superb job in getting the prime minister of South Africa, Mr. Vorster, to agree that the time had come for a solution to the problem of Rhodesia. Secretary Kissinger, in his meeting with uh  Prime Minister Smith of Rhodesia, was able to convince him that it was in the best interests of whites as well as blacks in Rhodesia to find an answer for a transitional government and then a majority government. This is a perfect example of the kind of leadership that the United States, under this administration, has taken. And I can assure you that this administration will follow that high moral principle in our future efforts in foreign policy, including our efforts in the Middle East where it is vitally important because the Middle East is the crossroads of the world. Thereve been more disputes in its area where theres more volatility than any other place in the world. But because Arab nations and the Israelis trust the United States, we were able to take the lead in the Sinai II Agreement. And I can assure you that the United States will have the leadership role in moving toward a comprehensive settlement of the Middle Eastern problems, I hope and trust as soon as possible. And we will do it with the highest moral principles.",1976-10-06,Republican,406
2020,Mr. Ford,"I would hope that as we move to one area of the world from another  and the United States must not spread itself too thinly  that was one of the problems that helped to create the circumstances in Vietnam  but as we as a nation find that we are asked by the various parties, either one nation against another or individuals within a nation, that the United States will take the leadership and try to resolve the differences. Let me take uh  South Korea as an example. I have personally told President Pack that the United States does not condone the kind of repressive measures that he has taken in that country. But I think in all fairness and equity we have to recognize the problem that South Korea has. On the north they have North Korea with five hundred thousand well-trained, well-equipped troops  they are supported by the Peoples Republic of China; they are supported by the Soviet Union. South Korea faces a very delicate situation. Now the United States, in this case, this administration, has recommended a year ago and we have reiterated it again this year, that the United States, South Korea, North Korea and the uh  Peoples Republic of China sit down at a conference table to resolve the problems of the Korean peninsula. This is a leadership role that the United States under this administration is carrying out, and if we do it, and I think the opportunities and the possibilities are getting better, we will have solved many of the internal domestic problems that exist in South Korea at the present time.",1976-10-06,Republican,268
2027,Mr. Ford,"The United States must and will maintain complete access to the Panama Canal. The United States must maintain a defense capability of the Panama Canal. And the United States will maintain our national security interest in the Panama Canal. The negotiations far the Panama Canal started under President Johnson and have continued up to the present time. I believe those negotiations should continue. But there are certain guidelines that must be followed, and Ive just defined them. Let me take just a minute to comment on something that Governor Carter said. On non  nu- oh  uh  nonproliferation, in May of l975, I called for a conference of uh  nuclear suppliers. That conference has met six times. In May of this year, Governor Carter took the first initiative, approximately twelve months after I had taken my initiative a year ago.",1976-10-06,Republican,139
2030,Mr. Ford,"The White House did not uh  prevent the release of that report. On July twelfth of this year, we gave full permission for the release of that report. I was very disappointed in the fact that the uh  GAO released that report because I think it interjected political partisan politics at the present time. But let me comment on the report. Somebody who sits in Washington, D.C., eighteen months after the Mayaguez incident, can be a very good grandstand quarterback. And let me make another observation. This morning, I got a call from the skipper of the Mayaguez. He was furious because he told me that it was the action of me, President Ford, that saved the lives of the crew of the Mayaguez. And I can assure you that if we had not taken the strong and forceful action that we did, we would have been uh  criticized very, very uh  severely for sitting back and not moving. Captain Miller is thankful. The crew is thankful. We did the right thing. It seems to me that those who sit in Washington eighteen months after the incident are not the best judges of the decision-making process that had to be made by the National Security Council and by myself at the time the incident was developing in the Pacific. Let me assure you that we made every possible overture to the Peoples Republic of China and through them to the Cambodian Government. We made uh  diplomatic uh  protests to the Cambodian government through the United Nations. Every possible diplomatic means was utilized. But at the same time, I had a responsibility, and so did the National Security Coun- Council, to meet the problem at hand. And we handled it responsibly and I think Captain Millers testimony to that effect is the best evidence.",1976-10-06,Republican,303
2037,Mr. Ford,"Again Governor Carter is inaccurate. The Arab boycott action was first taken in 1952. And in November of 1975 I was the first president to order the executive branch to take action, affirmative action, through the Department of Commerce and other cabinet departments, to make certain that no American businessman or business organization should discriminate against Jews because of an Arab boycott. And I might add that uh  my administration  and Im very proud of it  is the first administration that has taken an antitrust action against companies in this country that have allegedly cooperated with the Arab boycott. Just on Monday of this week I signed a tax bill that included an amendment that would prevent companies in the United States from taking a tax deduction if they have in any way whatsoever cooperated with the Arab boycott. And last week when we were trying to get the Export Administration Act through the Congress  necessary legislation  my administration went to Capitol Hill and tried to convince the House and the Senate that we should have an amendment on that legislation which would take strong and effective action against those who uh  participate or cooperate with the Arab uh boycott. One other point. Because the Congress failed to act, I am going to announce tomorrow that the Department of Commerce will disclose those companies that have uh  participated in the Arab boycott. This is something that we can do; the Congress failed to do it, and we intend to do it.",1976-10-06,Republican,251
2040,Mr. Ford,"Let me restate uh  our policy. As long as Vietnam, North Vietnam, does not give us a full and complete accounting of our missing in action, I will never uh  go along with the admission of Vietnam to the United Nations. If they do give us a bona fide, complete uh  accounting of the eight hundred MIAs, then I believe that the United States should begin negotiations for the uh  admission of Vietnam to the United Nations. But not until they have given us the full accounting of our MIAs.",1976-10-06,Republican,90
2046,Mr. Ford,"As we have seen tonight, foreign policy and defense policy are difficult and complex issues. We can debate methods, we can debate one decision or another, but there are two uh things which cannot be debated  experience and results. In the last two years, I have made policy decisions involving  long-range difficulties and policies and made day-to-day judgments not only as president of the United States but as the leader of the free world What is the result of that leadership? America is strong. America is free. America is respected. Not a single young American today is fighting or dying on any foreign battlefield. America is at peace and with freedom. Thank you, and good night.",1976-10-06,Republican,116
2057,Reagan,"Yes. I dont believe that Mr. Mondale has a plan for balancing the budget; he has a plan for raising taxes. And, as a matter of fact, the biggest single tax increase in our nations history took place 1977. And for the 5 years previous to our taking office, taxes doubled in the United States, and the budgets increased $318 billion. So, there is no ratio between taxing and balancing a budget. Whether you borrow the money or whether you simply tax it away from the people, youre taking the same amount of money out of the private sector, unless and until you bring down governments share of what it is taking. With regard to Social Security, I hope therell be more time than just this minute to mention that, but I will say this: A President should never say never. But Im going to violate that rule and say never. I will never stand for a reduction of the Social Security benefits to the people that are now getting them.",1984-10-07,Republican,171
2066,Reagan,"Well, whether he does or not, let me suggest my own idea about the leadership factor, since youve asked it. And, incidentally, I might say that with regard to the 25-percent cut in Social Security  before I get to the answer to your question  the only 25-percent cut that I know of was accompanying that huge 1977 tax increase, was a cut of 25 percent in the benefits for every American who was born after 1916. Now, leadership. First of all, I think you must have some principles you believe in. In mine, I happen to believe in the people and believe that the people are supposed to be dominant in our society  that they, not government, are to have control of their own affairs to the greatest extent possible, with an orderly society. Now, having that, I think also that in leadership  well, I believe that you find people, positions such as Im in who have the talent and ability to do the things that are needed in the various departments of government. I dont believe that a leader should be spending his time in the Oval Office deciding whos going to play tennis on the White House court. And you let those people go with the guidelines of overall policy, not looking over their shoulder and nitpicking the manner in which they go at the job. You are ultimately responsible, however, for that job. But I also believe something else about that. I believe that  and when I became Governor of California, I started this, and I continue it in this office  that any issue that comes before me, I have instructed Cabinet members and staff they are not to bring up any of the political ramifications that might surround the issue. I dont want to hear them. I want to hear only arguments as to whether it is good or bad for the people  is it morally right? And on that basis and that basis alone, we make a decision on every issue. Now, with regard to my feeling about why I thought that his record bespoke his possible taking us back to the same things that we knew under the previous administration, his record is that he spoke in praise of deficits several times, said they werent to be abhorred  that, as a matter of fact, he at one time said he wished the deficit could be doubled, because they stimulate the economy and helped reduce unemployment.",1984-10-07,Republican,411
2068,Reagan,"Our policy was not to cut subsidies. We have believed in partnership, and that was an example of a partnership between, not only local government and the Federal Government but also between the private sector that built that particular structure. And this is what weve been trying to do, is involve the Federal Government in such partnerships. We are today subsidizing housing for more than 10 million people, and were going to continue along that line. We have no thought of throwing people out into the snow, whether because of age or need. We have preserved the safety net for the people with true need in this country, and it has been pure demagoguery that we have in some way shut off all the charitable programs or many of them for the people who have real need. The safety net is there, and were taking care of more people than has ever been taken care of before by any administration in this country.",1984-10-07,Republican,163
2072,Reagan,"Well, let me just respond with regard to Social Security. When we took office, we discovered that the program that the Carter-Mondale administration had said would solve the fiscal problems of Social Security for the next 50 years wouldnt solve them for 5. Social Security was due to go bankrupt before 1983. Any proposals that I made at that time were at the request of the chairman, a Democrat, of one of the leading committees, who said we have to do something before the program goes broke and the checks bounce. And so, we made a proposal. And then in 1982, they used that proposal in a demagogic fashion for the 1982 campaign. And 3 days after the election in 1982, they came to us and said, Social Security, we know, is broke. Indeed, we had to borrow $17 billion to pay the checks. And then I asked for a bipartisan commission, which Id asked for from the beginning, to sit down and work out a solution. And so, the whole matter of what to do with Social Security has been resolved by bipartisan legislation, and it is on a sound basis now for as far as you can see into the next century.",1984-10-07,Republican,204
2075,Reagan,"Well, I was raised to have a faith and a belief and have been a member of a church since I was a small boy. In our particular church, we did not use that term, born again, so I dont know whether I would fit that  that particular term. But I have  thanks to my mother, God rest her soul  the firmest possible belief and faith in God. And I dont believe  I believe, I should say, as Lincoln once said, that I could not  I would be the most stupid man in the world if I thought I could confront the duties of the office I hold if I could not turn to someone who was stronger and greater than all others. And I do resort to prayer. At the same time, however, I have not believed that prayer should be introduced into an election or be a part of a political campaign  or religion a part of that campaign. As a matter of fact, I think religion became a part of this campaign when Mr. Mondales running mate said I wasnt a good Christian. So, it does play a part in my life. I have no hesitancy in saying so. And, as I say, I dont believe that I could carry on unless I had a belief in a higher authority and a belief that prayers are answered.",1984-10-07,Republican,230
2077,Reagan,"The answer to your question is very simple about why I dont go to church. I have gone to church regularly all my life, and I started to here in Washington. And now, in the position I hold and in the world in which we live, where Embassies do get blown up in Beirut  were supposed to talk about that on the debate the 21st, I understand  but I pose a threat to several hundred people if I go to church.",1984-10-07,Republican,81
2089,Reagan,"Yes, its very difficult to rebut, because I find myself in so much agreement with Mr. Mondale. I, too, want that wall that is in the Constitution of separation of church and state to remain there. The only attacks I have made are on people who apparently would break away at that wall from the government side, using the government, using the power of the courts and so forth to hinder that part of the Constitution that says the government shall not only not establish a religion, it shall not inhibit the practice of religion. And they have been using these things to have government, through court orders, inhibit the practice of religion. A child wants to say grace in a school cafeteria and a court rules that they cant do it because its school property. These are they types of things that I think have been happening in a kind of a secular way that have been eroding that separation, and I am opposed to that. With regard to a platform on the Supreme Court, I can only say one thing about that. I have appointed one member to the Supreme Court: Sandra Day OConnor. Ill stand on my record on that. And if I have the opportunity to appoint any more, Ill do it in the same manner that I did in selecting her.",1984-10-07,Republican,226
2098,Reagan,"Well, again, Im running on the record. I think sometimes Mr. Mondales running away from his. But Im running on the record of what we have asked for. Well continue to try to get things that we didnt get in a program that has already brought the rate of spending of government down from 17 percent to 6.1 percent, a program of returning authority and autonomy to the local and State governments that has been unjustly seized by the Federal Government. And you might find those words in a Democratic platform of some years ago  I know, because I was a Democrat at that time. And I left the party eventually, because I could no longer follow the turn in the Democratic leadership that took us down an entirely different path, a path of centralizing authority in the Federal Government, lacking trust in the American people. I promised, when we took office, that we would reduce inflation. We have, to one-third of what it was. I promised that we would reduce taxes. We did, 25 percent across the board. That barely held even with  if it did that much  with the gigantic tax increase imposed in 1977. But at least it took that burden away from them. I said that we would create jobs for our people, and we did  6 million in the last 20 or 21 months. I said that we would become respected in the world once again and that we would refurbish our national defense to the place that we could deal on the world scene and then seek disarmament, reduction of arms, and, hopefully, an elimination of nuclear weapons. We have done that. All of the things that I said we would do, from inflation being down, interest rates being down, unemployment falling, all of those things we have done. And I think this is something the American people see. I think they also know that we had a commission that came in a year ago with a recommendation on education  on excellence in education. And today, without the Federal Government being involved other than passing on to them, the school districts, the words from that commission, we find 35 States with task forces now dealing with their educational problems. We find that schools are extending the curriculum to now have forced teaching of mathematics and science and so forth. All of these things have brought an improvement in the college entrance exams for the first time in some 20 years. So, I think that many Democrats are seeing the same thing this Democrat saw: The leadership isnt taking us where we want to go.",1984-10-07,Republican,440
2100,Reagan,"There are tasks that government legitimately should enforce and tasks that government performs well, and youve named some of them. Crime has come down the last 2 years, for the first time in many, many decades that it has come down  or since weve kept records  2 consecutive years, and last year it came down the biggest drop in crime that weve had. I think that weve had something to do with that, just as we have with the drug problem nationwide. The environment? Yes, I feel as strongly as anyone about the preservation of the environment. When we took office, we found that the national parks were so dirty and contained so many hazards, lack of safety features, that we stopped buying additional park land until we had rectified this with what was to be a 5-year program  but its just about finished already  a billion dollars. And now were going back to budgeting for additional lands for our parks. We have added millions of acres to the wilderness lands, to the game refuges. I think that were out in front of most  and I see that the red light is blinking, so I cant continue. But Ive got more.",1984-10-07,Republican,201
2104,Reagan,"Before I campaigned as a Democrat for a Republican candidate for President, I had already voted for Dwight Eisenhower to be President of the United States. And so, my change had come earlier than that. I hadnt gotten around to reregistering as yet. I found that was rather difficult to do. But I finally did it. There are some other things that have been said here  back, and you said that I might be able to dredge them up. Mr. Mondale referred to the farmers worst year. The farmers are not the victims of anything this administration has done. The farmers were the victims of the double-digit inflation and the 21\1/2\-percent interest rates of the Carter-Mondale administration and the grain embargo, which destroyed our reliability nationwide as a supplier. All of these things are presently being rectified, and I think that we are going to salvage the farmers. As a matter of fact, there has been less than one-quarter of 1 percent of foreclosures of the 270,000 loans from government that the farmers have.",1984-10-07,Republican,174
2107,Reagan,"I have believed that in the appointment of judges that all that was specified in the party platform was that they respect the sanctity of human life. Now, that I would want to see in any judge and with regard to any issue having to do with human life. But with regard to abortion, and I have a feeling that this is  theres been some reference without naming it here in the remarks of Mr. Mondale tied to injecting religion into government. With me, abortion is not a problem of religion, its a problem of the Constitution. I believe that until and unless someone can establish that the unborn child is not a living human being, then that child is already protected by the Constitution, which guarantees life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness to all of us. And I think that this is what we should concentrate on, is trying  I know there were weeks and weeks of testimony before a Senate committee, there were medical authorities, there were religious  there were clerics there  everyone talking about this matter of prolife. And at the end of all of that, not one shred of evidence was introduced that the unborn child was not alive. We have seen premature births that are now grown-up, happy people going around. Also, there is a strange dichotomy in this whole position about our courts ruling that abortion is not the taking of a human life. In California, sometime ago, a man beat a woman so savagely that her unborn child was born dead with a fractured skull, and the California State Legislature unanimously passed a law that was signed by the then-Democratic Governor  signed a law that said that any man who so abuses a pregnant woman that he causes the death of her unborn child shall be charged with murder. Now, isnt it strange that that same woman could have taken the life of her unborn child, and it was abortion and not murder, but if somebody else does it, thats murder? And it used the term death of the unborn child. So, this has been my feeling about abortion, that we have a problem now to determine  and all the evidence so far comes down on the side of the unborn child being a living human being.",1984-10-07,Republican,385
2109,Reagan,"The laws regarding that always were State laws. It was only when the Supreme Court handed down a decision that the Federal Government intervened in what had always been a State policy. Our laws against murder are State laws. So, I would think that this would be the point of enforcement on this. As I say, I feel that we have a problem here to resolve. And no one has approached it from that matter. It does not happen that the church that I belong to had that as part of its dogma. I know that some churches do. Now, it is a sin if youre taking a human life. At the same time, in our Judeo-Christian tradition, we recognize the right of taking a human life in self-defense. And therefore, Ive always believed that a mother, if medically it is determined that her life is at risk if she goes through with the pregnancy, she has a right then to take the life of even her own unborn child in defense of her own.",1984-10-07,Republican,175
2115,Reagan,"Yes. Well, with regard to this being a personal choice, isnt that what a murderer is insisting on, his or her right to kill someone because of whatever fault they think justifies that? Now, Im not capable, and I dont think you are, any of us, to make this determination that must be made with regard to human life. I am simply saying that I believe that thats where the effort should be directed  to make that determination. I dont think that any of us should be called upon here to stand and make a decision as to what other things might come under the self-defense tradition. That, too, would have to be worked out then, when you once recognize that were talking about a life. But in this great society of ours, wouldnt it make a lot more sense, in this gentle and kind society, if we had a program that made it possible for when incidents come along in which someone feels they must do away with that unborn child, that instead we make it available for the adoption? There are a million and a half people out there standing in line waiting to adopt children who cant have them any other way.",1984-10-07,Republican,205
2124,Reagan,"You know, I wasnt going to say this at all, but I cant help it. There you go again. [Laughter] I dont have a plan to tax  or increase taxes. Im not going to increase taxes. I can understand why you are, Mr. Mondale, because as a Senator you voted 16 times to increase taxes. Now, I believe that our problem has not been that anybody in our country is undertaxed; its that government is overfed. And I think that most of our people  this is why we had a 25-percent tax cut across the board which maintained the same progressivity of our tax structure in the brackets on up. And, as a matter of fact, it just so happens that in the quirks of administering these taxes, those above $50,000 actually did not get quite as big a tax cut percentage-wise as did those from 50,000 down. From 50,000 down, those people paid two-thirds of the taxes, and those people got two-thirds of the tax cut. Now, the Social Security tax of 77  this indeed was a tax that hit people in the lower brackets the hardest. It had two features. It had several tax increases phased in over a period of time  there are two more yet to come between now and 1989. At the same time every year, it increased the amount of money  virtually every year, there may have been one or two that were skipped in there  that was subject to that tax. Today it is up to about $38,000 of earnings that is subject to the payroll tax for Social Security. And that tax, there are no deductions, so a person making anywhere from 10, 15, 20  theyre paying that tax on the full gross earnings that they have after they have already paid an income tax on that same amount of money. Now, I dont think that to try and say that we were taxing the rich, and not the other way around, it just doesnt work out that way. The system is still where it was with regard to the progressivity, as Ive said, and that has not been changed. But if you take it in numbers of dollars instead of percentage, yes, you could say, well, that person got 10 times as much as this other person. Yes, but he paid 10 times as much, also. But if you take it in percentages, then you find out that it is fair and equitable across the board.",1984-10-07,Republican,415
2126,Reagan,"Yes, I had used  last resort would always be with me. If you got the Government down to the lowest level, that you yourself could say it could not go any lower and still perform the services for the people, and if the recovery was so complete that you knew you were getting the ultimate amount of revenues that you could get through that growth, and there was still some slight difference there between those two lines, then I had said once that, yes, you would have to then look to see if taxes should not be adjusted. I dont foresee those things happening, so I say with great confidence Im not going to go for a tax. With regard to assailing Mr. Bush about his tax problems and the difference from the tax he once paid and then the later tax he paid, I think if you looked at the deductions, there were great legal expenses in there  had to do, possibly, with the sale of his home, and they had to do with his setting up of a blind trust. All of those are legally deductions, deductible in computing your tax, and it was a 1-year thing with him.",1984-10-07,Republican,201
2136,Reagan,"Yes. With regard to Medicare, no, but its time for us to say that Medicare is in pretty much the same condition that Social Security was, and something is going to have to be done in the next several years to make it fiscally sound. And, no, I never proposed any $20 billion should come out of Medicare; I have proposed that the program we must treat with that particular problem. And maybe part of that problem is because during the 4 years of the Carter-Mondale administration medical costs in this country went up 87 percent.",1984-10-07,Republican,96
2141,Reagan,"Well, some of those facts and figures just dont stand up. Yes, there has been an increase in poverty, but it is a lower rate of increase than it was in the preceding years before we got here. It has begun to decline, but it is still going up. On the other hand, women heads of household  single women heads of household have  for the first time theres been a turndown in the rate of poverty for them. We have found also in our studies that in this increase in poverty, it all had to do with their private earnings. It had nothing to do with the transfer of payments from government by way of many programs. We are spending now 37 percent more on food for the hungry in all the various types of programs than was spent in 1980. Were spending a third more on all of the  well, all of the programs of human service. We have more people receiving food stamps than were ever receiving them before  2,300,000 more are receiving them  even though we took 850,000 off the food stamp rolls because they were making an income that was above anything that warranted their fellow citizens having to support them. We found people making 185 percent of the poverty level were getting government benefits. We have set a line at 130 percent so that we can direct that aid down to the truly needy. Some time ago, Mr. Mondale said something about education and college students and help of that kind. Half  one out of two of the full-time college students in the United States are receiving some form of Federal aid. But there, again, we found people that there under the previous administration, families that had no limit to income were still eligible for low-interest college loans. We didnt think that was right. And so, we have set a standard that those loans and those grants are directed to the people who otherwise could not go to college, their family incomes were so low. So, there are a host of other figures that reveal that the grant programs are greater than they have ever been, taking care of more people than they ever have. 7.7 million elderly citizens who were living in the lowest 20 percent of earnings  7.7 million have moved up into another bracket since our administration took over, leaving only 5 million of the elderly in that bracket when there had been more than 13 million.",1984-10-07,Republican,415
2145,Reagan,"That had nothing to do with the other thing of talking about their needs or anything. I remember distinctly, I was segueing into another subject. I was talking about the things that have been accomplished, and that was referring to the revival of patriotism and optimism, the new spirit that were finding all over America. And it is a wonderful thing to see when you get out there among the people. So, that was the only place that that was used. I did avoid, Im afraid, in my previous answer, also, the idea of uneven, yes. There is no way that the recovery is even across the country, just as in the depths of the recession, there were some parts of the country that were worse off, but some that didnt even feel the pain of the recession. Were not going to rest and not going to be happy until every person in this country who wants a job can have one, until the recovery is complete across the country.",1984-10-07,Republican,170
2151,Reagan,"Yes. The connection thats been made again between the deficit and the interest rates  there is no connection between them. There is a connection between interest rates and inflation, but I would call to your attention that in 1981 while we were operating still on the Carter-Mondale budget that we inherited  that the interest rates came down from 21\1/2\, down toward the 12 or 13 figure. And while they were coming down, the deficits had started their great increase. They were going up. Now, if there was a connection I think that there would be a different parallel between deficits getting larger and interest rates going down. The interest rates are based on inflation. And right now I have to tell you I dont think there is any excuse for the interest rates being as high as they are because we have brought inflation down so low. I think it can only be that theyre anticipating or hope  expecting, not hoping, that maybe we dont have a control of inflation and its going to go back up again. Well, it isnt going to go back up. Were going to see that it doesnt. And I havent got time to answer with regard to the disabled.",1984-10-07,Republican,205
2160,Reagan,"Well, now, I have to start with a smile, since his kind words to me. Ill tell you what I think has been the most outrageous thing in political dialog, both in this campaign and the one in 82. And that is the continued discussion and claim that somehow I am the villain who is going to pull the Social Security checks out from those people who are dependent on them. And why I think it is outrageous  first of all, it isnt true. But why it is outrageous is because, for political advantage, every time they do that, they scare millions of senior citizens who are totally dependent on Social Security, have no place else to turn. And they have to live and go to bed at night thinking, Is this true? Is someone going to take our check away from us and leave us destitute? And I dont think that that should be a part of political dialog.",1984-10-07,Republican,160
2164,Reagan,"Okay. All right. Now, Social Security, lets lay it to rest once and for all. I told you never would I do such a thing. But I tell you also now, Social Security has nothing to do with the deficit. Social Security is totally funded by the payroll tax levied on employer and employee. If you reduce the out-go of Social Security, that money would not go into the general fund to reduce a deficit. It would go into the Social Security Trust Fund. So, Social Security has nothing to do with balancing a budget or erasing or lowering the deficit. Now, again, to get to whether I am depending on magic, I think I have talked in straight economic terms about a program of recovery that I was told wouldnt work. And then, after it worked, I was told that lowering taxes would increase inflation. And none of these things happened. It is working, and were going to continue on that same line. As to what we might do, and find in further savings cuts, no, were not going to starve the hungry. But we have 2,478 specific recommendations from a commission of more than 2,000 business people in this country, through the Grace commission, that were studying right now  and weve already implemented 17 percent of them  that are recommendations as to how to make government more efficient, more economic.",1984-10-07,Republican,232
2166,Reagan,"Why the deficits are so much of a problem for him now, but that in 1976, when the deficit was $52 billion and everyone was panicking about that, he said, no, that he thought it ought to be bigger, because a bigger deficit would stimulate the economy and would help do away with unemployment. In 1979 he made similar statements, the same effect, that the deficits  there was nothing wrong with having deficits. Remember, there was a trillion dollars in debt before we got here. Thats got to be paid by our children and grandchildren, too, if we dont do it. And Im hoping we can start some payments on it before we get through here. Thats why I want another 4 years.",1984-10-07,Republican,123
2178,Reagan,"Four years ago, in similar circumstances to this, I asked you, the American people, a question. I asked: Are you better off than you were 4 years before? The answer to that obviously was no, and as the result, I was elected to this office and promised a new beginning. Now, maybe Im expected to ask that same question again. Im not going to, because I think that all of you  or not everyone, those people that are in those pockets of poverty and havent caught up, they couldnt answer the way I would want them to  but I think that most of the people in this country would say, yes, they are better off than they were 4 years ago. The question, I think, should be enlarged. Is America better off than it was 4 years ago? And I believe the answer to that has to also be yes. I promised a new beginning. So far, it is only a beginning. If the job were finished, I might have thought twice about seeking reelection for this job. But we now have an economy that, for the first time  well, lets put it this way: In the first half of 1980, gross national product was down a minus 3.7 percent. The first half of 84 its up 8\1/2\ percent. Productivity in the first half of 1980 was down a minus 2 percent. Today it is up a plus 4 percent. Personal earnings after taxes per capita have gone up almost $3,000 in these 4 years. In 1980  or 1979, a person with a fixed income of $8,000 was $500 above the poverty line, and this maybe explains why there are the numbers still in poverty. By 1980 that same person was $500 below the poverty line. We have restored much of our economy. With regard to business investment, it is higher than it has been since 1949. So, there seems to be no shortage of investment capital. We have, as I said, cut the taxes, but we have reduced inflation, and for 2 years now it has stayed down there, not at double digit, but in the range of 4 or below. We believe that we had also promised that we would make our country more secure. Yes, we have an increase in the defense budget. But back then we had planes that couldnt fly for lack of spare parts or pilots. We had navy vessels that couldnt leave harbor because of lack of crew or, again, lack of spare parts. Today were well on our way to a 600-ship navy. We have 543 at present. We have  our military, the morale is high. I think the people should understand that two-thirds of the defense budget pays for pay and salary, or pay and pension. And then you add to that food and wardrobe, and all the other things, and you only have a small portion going for weapons. But I am determined that if ever our men are called on, they should have the best that we can provide in the manner of tools and weapons. There has been reference to expensive spare parts, hammers costing $500. Well, we are the ones who found those. I think weve given the American people back their spirit. I think theres an optimism in the land and a patriotism, and I think that were in a position once again to heed the words of Thomas Paine, who said: We have it in our power to begin the world over again.",1984-10-07,Republican,588
2523,Reagan,"No, but Im glad you asked that question, because I know its on many peoples minds. I have ordered an investigation. I know that the CIA is already going forward with one. We have a gentleman down in Nicaragua who is on contract to the CIA, advising  supposedly on military tactics  the contras. And he drew up this manual. It was turned over to the agency head of the CIA in Nicaragua to be printed. And a number of pages were excised by that agency head there, the man in charge, and he sent it on up here to CIA, where more pages were excised before it was printed. But some way or other, there were 12 of the original copies that got out down there and were not submitted for this printing process by the CIA. Now, those are the details as we have them. And as soon as we have an investigation and find out where any blame lies for the few that did not get excised or changed, we certainly are going to do something about that. Well take the proper action at the proper time. I was very interested to hear about Central America and our process down there, and I thought for a moment that instead of a debate I was going to find Mr. Mondale in complete agreement with what were doing, because the plan that he has outlined is the one weve been following for quite some time, including diplomatic processes throughout Central America and working closely with the Contadora group. So, I can only tell you about the manual  that were not in the habit of assigning guilt before there has been proper evidence produced and proof of that guilt. But if guilt is established, whoever is guilty we will treat with that situation then, and they will be removed.",1984-10-21,Republican,308
2525,Reagan,"Im afraid I misspoke when I said a CIA head in Nicaragua. Theres not someone there directing all of this activity. There are, as you know, CIA men stationed in other countries in the world and, certainly, in Central America. And so it was a man down there in that area that this was delivered to, and he recognized that what was in that manual was in direct contravention of my own Executive order, in December of 1981, that we would have nothing to do with regard to political assassinations.",1984-10-21,Republican,90
2529,Reagan,"Yes. I have so many things there to respond to, Im going to pick out something you said earlier. Youve been all over the country repeating something that, I will admit, the press has also been repeating  that I believed that nuclear missiles could be fired and then called back. I never, ever conceived of such a thing. I never said any such thing. In a discussion of our strategic arms negotiations, I said that submarines carrying missiles and airplanes carrying missiles were more conventional-type weapons, not as destabilizing as the land-based missiles, and that they were also weapons that  or carriers  that if they were sent out and there was a change, you could call them back before they had launched their missiles.",1984-10-21,Republican,124
2532,Reagan,"I have said on a number of occasions exactly what I believe about the Soviet Union. I retract nothing that I have said. I believe that many of the things they have done are evil in any concept of morality that we have. But I also recognize that as the two great superpowers in the world, we have to live with each other. And I told Mr. Gromyko we dont like their system. They dont like ours. And were not going to change their system, and they sure better not try to change ours. But between us, we can either destroy the world or we can save it. And I suggested that, certainly, it was to their common interest, along with ours, to avoid a conflict and to attempt to save the world and remove the nuclear weapons. And I think that perhaps we established a little better understanding. I think that in dealing with the Soviet Union one has to be realistic. I know that Mr. Mondale, in the past, has made statements as if they were just people like ourselves, and if we were kind and good and did something nice, they would respond accordingly. And the result was unilateral disarmament. We canceled the B  1 under the previous administration. What did we get for it? Nothing. The Soviet Union has been engaged in the biggest military buildup in the history of man at the same time that we tried the policy of unilateral disarmament, of weakness, if you will. And now we are putting up a defense of our own. And Ive made it very plain to them, we seek no superiority. We simply are going to provide a deterrent so that it will be too costly for them if they are nursing any ideas of aggression against us. Now, they claim theyre not. And I made it plain to them, were not. Theres been no change in my attitude at all. I just thought when I came into office it was time that there was some realistic talk to and about the Soviet Union. And we did get their attention.",1984-10-21,Republican,354
2534,Reagan,"Ah, well, now youve added a hypothetical there at the end, Mr. Kalb, about where we would send troops in to fight. I am not going to make the decision as to what the tactics could be, but obviously there are a number of areas in the world that are of importance to us. One is the Middle East, and that is of interest to the whole Western World and the industrialized nations, because of the great supply of energy upon which so many depend there. Our neighbors here in America are vital to us. Were working right now in trying to be of help in southern Africa with regard to the independence of Namibia and the removal of the Cuban surrogates, the thousands of them, from Angola. So, I can say there are a great many interests. I believe that we have a great interest in the Pacific Basin. That is where I think the future of the world lies. But I am not going to pick out one and, in advance, hypothetically say, Oh, yes, we would send troops there. I dont want to send troops any place.",1984-10-21,Republican,190
2544,Reagan,"Yes. Im not going to continue trying to respond to these repetitions of the falsehoods that have already been stated here. But with regard to whether Mr. Mondale would be strong, as he said he would be, I know that he has a commercial out where hes appearing on the deck of the Nimitz and watching the F  14s take off. And thats an image of strength  except that if he had had his way when the Nimitz was being planned, he would have been deep in the water out there because there wouldnt have been any Nimitz to stand on  he was against it. [Laughter] He was against the F  14 fighter, he was against the M  1 tank, he was against the B  1 bomber, he wanted to cut the salary of all of the military, he wanted to bring home half of the American forces in Europe. And he has a record of weakness with regard to our national defense that is second to none.",1984-10-21,Republican,168

2555,Reagan,"No, Morton, I dont agree to all of those things. First of all, when we and our allies  the Italians, the French, and the United Kingdom  went into Lebanon, we went in there at the request of what was left of the Lebanese Government to be a stabilizing force while they tried to establish a government. But the first  pardon me  the first time we went in, we went in at their request because the war was going on right in Beirut between Israel and the PLO terrorists. Israel could not be blamed for that. Those terrorists had been violating their northern border consistently, and Israel chased them all the way to there. Then we went in with the multinational force to help remove, and did remove, more than 13,000 of those terrorists from Lebanon. We departed. And then the Government of Lebanon asked us back in as a stabilizing force while they established a government and sought to get the foreign forces all the way out of Lebanon and that they could then take care of their own borders. And we were succeeding. We were there for the better part of a year. Our position happened to be at the airport. Oh, there were occasional snipings and sometimes some artillery fire, but we did not engage in conflict that was out of line with our mission. I will never send troops anywhere on a mission of that kind without telling them that if somebody shoots at them, they can darn well shoot back. And this is what we did. We never initiated any kind of action; we defended ourselves there. But we were succeeding to the point that the Lebanese Government had been organized  if you will remember, there were the meetings in Geneva in which they began to meet with the hostile factional forces and try to put together some kind of a peace plan. We were succeeding, and that was why the terrorist acts began. There are forces there  and that includes Syria, in my mind  who dont want us to succeed, who dont want that kind of a peace with a dominant Lebanon, dominant over its own territory. And so, the terrorist acts began and led to the one great tragedy when they were killed in that suicide bombing of the building. Then the multilateral force withdrew for only one reason: We withdrew because we were no longer able to carry out the mission for which we had been sent in. But we went in in the interest of peace and to keep Israel and Syria from getting into the sixth war between them. And I have no apologies for our going on a peace mission.",1984-10-21,Republican,450
2557,Reagan,"Morton, no. I think theres a great difference between the Government of Iran threatening our diplomatic personnel, and there is a government that you can see and can put your hand on. In the terrorist situation, there are terrorist factions all over. In a recent 30-day period, 37 terrorist acts in 20 countries have been committed. The most recent has been the one in Brighton. In dealing with terrorists, yes, we want to retaliate, but only if we can put our finger on the people responsible and not endanger the lives of innocent civilians there in the various communities and in the city of Beirut where these terrorists are operating. I have just signed legislation to add to our ability to deal, along with our allies, with this terrorist problem. And its going to take all the nations together, just as when we banded together we pretty much resolved the whole problem of skyjackings sometime ago. Well, the red light went on. I could have gone on forever.",1984-10-21,Republican,168
2561,Reagan,"Yes. First of all, Mr. Mondale should know that the President of the United States did not order the marines into that barracks. That was a command decision made by the commanders on the spot and based with what they thought was best for the men there. That is one. On the other things that youve just said about the terrorists, Im tempted to ask you what you would do. These are unidentified people, and after the bomb goes off, theyre blown to bits because they are suicidal individuals who think theyre going to go to paradise if they perpetrate such an act and lose their life in doing it. We are going to, as I say, were busy trying to find the centers where these operations stem from, and retaliation will be taken. But were not going to simply kill some people to say, Oh, look, we got even. We want to know when we retaliate that were retaliating with those who are responsible for the terrorist acts. And terrorist acts are such that our own United States Capitol in Washington has been bombed twice.",1984-10-21,Republican,186
2563,Reagan,"Not at all, Mr. Trewhitt, and I want you to know that also I will not make age an issue of this campaign. I am not going to exploit, for political purposes, my opponents youth and inexperience.

2564,Reagan,"Yes, this had to do with our disarmament talks. And the whole controversy about land missiles came up because we thought that the strategic nuclear weapons, the most destabilizing are the land-based. You put your thumb on a button and somebody blows up 20 minutes later. So, we thought that it would be simpler to negotiate first with those. And then we made it plain, a second phase, take up the submarine-launched or the airborne missiles. But even after we gave in and said, All right, lets discuss it all, they walked away from the table. We didnt.",1984-10-21,Republican,98
2568,Reagan,"Yes. I know itll come as a surprise to Mr. Mondale, but I am in charge. And, as a matter of fact, we havent avoided arms control talks with the Soviet Union. Very early in my administration I proposed  and I think something that had never been proposed by any previous administration  I proposed a total elimination of intermediate-range missiles, where the Soviets had better than a 10  and still have  better than a 10-to-1 advantage over the allies in Europe. When they protested that and suggested a smaller number, perhaps, I went along with that. The so-called negotiation that you said I walked out on was the so-called walk in the woods between one of our representatives and one of the Soviet Union, and it wasnt me that turned it down, the Soviet Union disavowed it.",1984-10-21,Republican,137
2577,Reagan,"Georgie Anne, we, believe me, supported the Simpson-Mazzoli bill strongly  and the bill that came out of the Senate. However, there were things added in in the House side that we felt made it less of a good bill; as a matter of fact, made it a bad bill. And in conference  we stayed with them in conference all the way to where even Senator Simpson did not want the bill in the manner in which it would come out of the conference committee. There were a number of things in there that weakened that bill. I cant go into detail about them here. But it is true our borders are out of control. It is also true that this has been a situation on our borders back through a number of administrations. And I supported this bill. I believe in the idea of amnesty for those who have put down roots and who have lived here even though sometime back they may have entered illegally. With regard to the employer sanctions, we must have that not only to ensure that we can identify the illegal aliens, but also, while some keep protesting about what it would do to employers, there is another employer that we shouldnt be so concerned about, and these are employers down through the years who have encouraged the illegal entry into this country because they then hire these individuals and hire them at starvation wages and with none of the benefits that we think are normal and natural for workers in our country, and the individuals cant complain because of their illegal status. We dont think that those people should be allowed to continue operating free. And this was why the provisions that we had in with regard to sanctions, and so forth  and Im going to do everything I can, and all of us in the administration are, to join in again when Congress is back at it to get an immigration bill that will give us, once again, control of our borders. And with regard to friendship below the border and with the countries down there, yes, no administration that I know has established the relationship that we have with our Latin friends. But as long as they have an economy that leaves so many people in dire poverty and unemployment, they are going to seek that employment across our borders. And we work with those other countries.",1984-10-21,Republican,405
2579,Reagan,"No. As a matter of fact, the population explosion, if you look at the actual figures, has been vastly exaggerated  over exaggerated. As a matter of fact, there are some pretty scientific and solid figures about how much space there still is in the world and how many more people we can have. Its almost like going back to the Malthusian theory, when even then they were saying that everyone would starve with the limited population they had then. But the problem of population growth is one, here, with regard to our immigration. And we have been the safety valve, whether we wanted to or not, with the illegal entry here, in Mexico, where their population is increasing and they dont have an economy that can absorb them and provide the jobs. And this is what were trying to work out, not only to protect our own borders but to have some kind of fairness and recognition of that problem.",1984-10-21,Republican,160
2583,Reagan,"Well, my rebuttal is Ive heard the national debt blamed for a lot of things, but not for illegal immigration across our border  [laughter]  and it has nothing to do with it.",1984-10-21,Republican,32
2586,Reagan,"Mr. Kalb, I think what has been hailed as something Im supposedly, as President, discussing as principle is the recall of just some philosophical discussions with people who are interested in the same things; and that is the prophecies down through the years, the biblical prophecies of what would portend the coming of Armageddon, and so forth, and the fact that a number of theologians for the last decade or more have believed that this was true, that the prophecies are coming together that portend that. But no one knows whether Armageddon, those prophecies mean that Armageddon is a thousand years away or day after tomorrow. So, I have never seriously warned and said we must plan according to Armageddon. Now, with regard to having to say whether we would try to survive in the event of a nuclear war, of course we would. But let me also point out that to several parliaments around the world, in Europe and in Asia, I have made a statement to each one of them, and Ill repeat it here: A nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought. And that is why we are maintaining a deterrent and trying to achieve a deterrent capacity to where no one would believe that they could start such a war and escape with limited damage.",1984-10-21,Republican,222
2588,Reagan,"Why not? What if we did  and I hope we can; were still researching  what if we come up with a weapon that renders those missiles obsolete? There has never been a weapon invented in the history of man that has not led to a defensive, a counterweapon. But suppose we came up with that? Now, some people have said, Ah, that would make war imminent, because they would think that we could launch a first strike because we could defend against the enemy. But why not do what I have offered to do and asked the Soviet Union to do? Say, Look, heres what we can do. Well even give it to you. Now, will you sit down with us and once and for all get rid, all of us, of these nuclear weapons and free mankind from that threat? I think that would be the greatest use of a defensive weapon.",1984-10-21,Republican,153
2596,Reagan,"Yes, my rebuttal, once again, is that this invention that has just been created here of how I would go about rolling over for the Soviet Union  no, Mr. Mondale, my idea would be with that defensive weapon that we would sit down with them and then say, Now, are you willing to join us? Heres what we  give them a demonstration and then say  Heres what we can do. Now, if youre willing to join us in getting rid of all the nuclear weapons in the world, then well give you this one, so that we would both know that no one can cheat; that were both got something that if anyone tries to cheat . . . . But when you keep star-warring it  I never suggested where the weapons should be or what kind; Im not a scientist. I said, and the Joint Chiefs of Staff agreed with me, that it was time for us to turn our research ability to seeing if we could not find this kind of defensive weapon. And suddenly somebody says, Oh, its got to be up there, and its Star Wars, and so forth. I dont know what it would be, but if we can come up with one, I think the world will be better off.",1984-10-21,Republican,216
2605,Reagan,"Morton, I did criticize the President because of our undercutting of what was a stalwart ally  the Shah of Iran. And I am not at all convinced that he was that far out of line with his people or that they wanted that to happen. The Shah had done our bidding and carried our load in the Middle East for quite some time, and I did think that it was a blot on our record that we let him down. Have things gotten better? The Shah, whatever he might have done, was building low-cost housing, had taken land away from the Mullahs and was distributing it to the peasants so they could be landowners  things of that kind. But we turned it over to a maniacal fanatic who has slaughtered thousands and thousands of people, calling it executions. The matter of Somoza  no, I never defended Somoza. And, as a matter of fact, the previous administration stood by and so did I  not that I could have done anything in my position at that time  but for this revolution to take place. And the promise of the revolution was democracy, human rights, free labor unions, free press. And then, just as Castro had done in Cuba, the Sandinistas ousted the other parties to the revolution. Many of them are now the contras. They exiled some, they jailed some, they murdered some. And they installed a Marxist-Leninist totalitarian government. And what I have to say about this is, many times  and this has to do with the Philippines, also, I know there are things there in the Philippines that do not look good to us from the standpoint right now of democratic rights, but what is the alternative? It is a large Communist movement to take over the Philippines. They have been our friend since their inception as a nation. And I think that weve had enough of a record of letting  under the guise of revolution  someone that we thought was a little more right than we would be, letting that person go, and then winding up with totalitarianism, pure and simple, as the alternative. And I think that were better off, for example with the Philippines, of trying to retain our friendship and help them right the wrongs we see, rather than throwing them to the wolves and then facing a Communist power in the Pacific.",1984-10-21,Republican,397
2607,Reagan,"Well, as I say, we have to look at what an overthrow there would mean and what the government would be that would follow. And there is every evidence, every indication that that government would be hostile to the United States. And that would be a severe blow to our abilities there in the Pacific.",1984-10-21,Republican,55
2612,Reagan,"Well, the invasion of Afghanistan didnt take place on our watch. I have described what has happened in Iran, and we werent here then either. I dont think that our record of human rights can be assailed. I think that we have observed, ourselves, and have done our best to see that human rights are extended throughout the world. Mr. Mondale has recently announced a plan of his to get the democracies together and to work with the whole world to turn to democracy. And I was glad to hear him say that, because thats what weve been doing ever since I announced to the British Parliament that I thought we should do this. Human rights are not advanced when, at the same time, you then stand back and say, Whoops, we didnt know the gun was loaded, and you have another totalitarian power on your hands.",1984-10-21,Republican,147
2615,Reagan,"Well, I cant say that I have roundtabled that and sat down with the Chiefs of Staff, but I have said that it seems to me that this could be a logical step in what is my ultimate goal, my ultimate dream, and that is the elimination of nuclear weapons in the world. And it seems to me that this could be an adjunct, or certainly a great assisting agent in getting that done. I am not going to roll over, as Mr. Mondale suggests, and give them something that could turn around and be used against us. But I think its a very interesting proposal, to see if we can find, first of all, something that renders those weapons obsolete, incapable of their mission. But Mr. Mondale seems to approve MAD  MAD is mutual assured destruction  meaning, if you use nuclear weapons on us, the only thing we have to keep you from doing it is that well kill as many people of yours as youll kill of ours. I think that to do everything we can to find, as I say, something that would destroy weapons and not humans is a great step forward in human rights.",1984-10-21,Republican,199
2620,Reagan,"Yes. My thanks to the League of Women Voters, to the panelists, the moderator, and to the people of Kansas City for their warm hospitality and greeting. I think the American people tonight have much to be grateful for  an economic recovery that has become expansion, freedom and, most of all, we are at peace. I am grateful for the chance to reaffirm my commitment to reduce nuclear weapons and, one day, to eliminate them entirely. We shouldnt be dwelling on the past, or even the present. The meaning of this election is the future and whether were going to grow and provide the jobs and the opportunities for all Americans and that they need. Several years ago, I was given an assignment to write a letter. It was to go into a time capsule and would be read in 100 years when that time capsule was opened. I remember driving down the California coast one day. My mind was full of what I was going to put in that letter about the problems and the issues that confront us in our time and what we did about them. But I couldnt completely neglect the beauty around me  the Pacific out there on one side of the highway, shining in the sunlight, the mountains of the coast range rising on the other side. And I found myself wondering what it would be like for someone  wondering if someone 100 years from now would be driving down that highway, and if they would see the same thing. And with that thought, I realized what a job I had with that letter. I would be writing a letter to people who know everything there is to know about us. We know nothing about them. They would know all about our problems. They would know how we solved them, and whether our solution was beneficial to them down through the years or whether it hurt them. They would also know that we lived in a world with terrible weapons, nuclear weapons of terrible destructive power, aimed at each other, capable of crossing the ocean in a matter of minutes and destroying civilization as we knew it. And then I thought to myself, what are they going to say about us, what are those people 100 years from now going to think? They will know whether we used those weapons or not. Well, what they will say about us 100 years from now depends on how we keep our rendezvous with destiny. Will we do the things that we know must be done and know that one day, down in history 100 years or perhaps before, someone will say, Thank God for those people back in the 1980s for preserving our freedom, for saving for us this blessed planet called Earth, with all its grandeur and its beauty. You know, I am grateful to all of you for giving me the opportunity to serve you for these 4 years, and I seek reelection because I want more than anything else to try to complete the new beginning that we charted 4 years ago. George Bush, who I think is one of the finest Vice Presidents this country has ever had  George Bush and I have crisscrossed the country, and weve had, in these last few months, a wonderful experience. We have met young America. We have met your sons and daughters.",1984-10-21,Republican,567
4902,Mr. Ford,"Mr. Kraft, I believe that the American people, in the next four years under a Ford administration, will be called upon to make those necessary sacrifices to preserve the peace which we have. Which means, of course, that uh  we will have to maintain an adequate military capability  which means, of course, that we will have to add a uh  I think uh  a few billion dollars to our defense appropriations to make certain that we have adequate uh -strategic forces  adequate conventional forces. I think the American people will be called upon to uh  uh  be in the forefront in giving leadership to the solution of those problems that must be solved in the Middle East, in southern Africa, and any problems that might arise in the Pacific. The American people will be called upon to tighten their belts a bit in meeting some of the problems that we face domestically. I dont think that uh  America can go on a big spending spree with a whole lot of new programs uh  that would add significantly to the federal budget. I believe that the American people, if given the leadership that I would expect to give, would be willing to give this thrust to preserve the peace and the necessary restraint at home to hold the lid on spending so that we could, I think, have a long overdue and totally justified tax decrease for the middle-income people. And then, with the economy that would be generated from a restraint on spending, and a tax uh reduction primarily for the middle-income people, then I think the American people would be willing to make those sacrifices for peace and prosperity in the next uh  four years.",1976-10-22,Republican,286
4904,Mr. Ford,"Surely, surely, overlapping. Doesnt your policy really imply that were going to have a fairly high rate of unemployment over a fairly long time, that growth is gonna be fairly slow, and that were not gonna be able to do much  very much in the next four or five years to meet the basic agenda of our national needs in the cities, in health, uh in transit and a whole lot of things like that.",1976-10-22,Republican,75
4906,Mr. Ford,"No, Mr. Kraft, were spending very significant amounts of money now, some $200 billion a year, almost 50 percent of our total federal expenditure uh  by the federal government at the present time for human needs. Now we will probably need to increase that to same extent. But we dont have to have  growth in spending that will blow the lid off and add to the problems of inflation. I believe we can meet the problems within the cities of this country and still uh  give a tax reduction. I proposed, as you know, a reduction to increase the personal exemption from seven hundred and fifty to a thousand dollars. With the fiscal program that I have, and if you look at the projections, it shows that we will reduce unemployment, that we will continue to win the battle against inflation, and at the same time give the kind of quality of life that I believe is possible in America. Uh  a job, a home for all those thatll work and save for it, uh  safety in the streets, uh  health that is a  health care that is affordable. These things can be done if we have the right vision and the right restraint and the right leadership.",1976-10-22,Republican,208
4913,Mr. Ford,"I believe that the uh  American people have been turned off in this election, uh  Mr. Maynard, for a variety of reasons. We have seen on Capitol Hill, in the Congress, uh  a great many uh  allegations of wrong-doing, of uh  alleged immorality, uh  those are very disturbing to the American people. They wonder how an elected representative uh  can serve them and participate in such activities uh  serving in the Congress of the United States. Yes, and Im certain many, many Americans were turned off by the revelations of Watergate, a very, very uh  bad period of time in American political history. Yes, and thousands, maybe millions of Americans were turned off because of the uh  problems that came out of our involvement in Vietnam. But on the other hand, I found on July fourth of this year, a new spirit born in America. We were celebrating our Bicentennial; and I find that uh  there is a  a movement as I travel around the country of greater interest in this campaign. Now, like uh  any hardworking uh  person seeking public office uh  in the campaign, inevitably sometimes you will use uh  rather graphic language and Im guilty of that just like I think most others in the political arena. But I do make a pledge that in the next ten days when were asking the American people to make one of the most important decisions in their lifetime, because I think this election is one of the mast vital in the history of America, that uh  we do together what we can to stimulate voter participation.",1976-10-22,Republican,267
4916,Mr. Ford,"Well, Mr. uh  Nelson, uh  I testified before two committees, House and Senate, on precisely the questions that you have asked. And the testimony under oath was to the effect that I did not talk to Mr. Nixon, to Mr. Haldeman, to Mr. Ehrlichman, or to any of the people at the White House. I said I had no recollection whatsoever of talking with any of the White House legislative liaison people. I indicated under oath that the initiative that I took was at the request of the ranking members of the House Banking and Currency Committee on the Republican side, which was a legitimate request and a proper response by me. Now that was gone into by two congressional committees, and following that investigation, both committees overwhelmingly approved me, and the House and the Senate did likewise. Now, in the meantime, the special prosecutor, within the last few days, after an investigation himself, said there was no reason for him to get involved because he found nothing that would justify it. And then just a day or two ago, the attorney general of the United States made a further investigation and came to precisely the same conclusion. Now, after all of those investigations by objective, responsible people, I think the matter is closed once and for all. But to add one other feature, I dont control any of the tapes. Those tapes are in the jurisdiction of the courts and I have no right to say yes or no. But all the committees, the attorney general, the special prosecutor, all of them have given me a clean bill of health. I think the matter is settled once and for all.",1976-10-22,Republican,281
4918,Mr. Ford,"Thats for the uh  proper authorities who have control over those tapes to make that decision. I have given every bit of evidence, answered every question thats as- been asked me by any senator or any member of the House. Plus the fact, that the special prosecutor, on his own initiation, and the attorney general on his initiation, the highest law enforcement official in this country, all of them have given me a clean bill of health. And Ive told everything I know about it. I think the matter is settled once and for all.",1976-10-22,Republican,95
4927,Mr. Ford,"I firmly believe, uh  Mr. Kraft, that its unwise for a president to signal in advance what uh  options he might exercise if any uhh  international problem arose. I think we all recall with some sadness that at uh  the period of the nin- late nineteen forties, early nineteen fifties, there were some indications that the United States would not include uh  South Korea in an area of defense. There are some who allege, I cant prove it true or untrue, that uh  such a statement uh  in effect invited the North Koreans to invade South Korea. Its a fact they did. But no president of the United States, in my opinion, should signal in advance to a prospective enemy, what his uhh  decision might be or what option he might exercise. Its far better for a person sitting in the White House uh  who has a number of options to make certain that the uh  other side, so to speak, doesnt know precisely what youre going to do. And therefore, that was the reason that I would not uh  identify any particular course of action uh  when I responded to a question a week or so ago.",1976-10-22,Republican,198
4930,Mr. Ford,"I have indicated to General Brown that uh  the words that he used in that interview, in that particular case and in several others, were very ill advised. And General Brown has indicated uh  his apology, his regrets, and I think that will, uh  in this situation, settle the matter. It is tragic that uh  the full transcript of that interview was not released and that there were excerpts, some of the excerpts, taken out of context. Not this one, however, that you bring up. General Brown has an exemply [sic] record of military performance. He served this nation with great, great skill and courage and bravery for thirty-five years. And I think its the consensus of the people who are knowledgeable in the military field, that he is probably the outstanding military leader and strategist that we have in America today. Now he did use uh  ill-advised words, but I think in the fact that he apologized, that he was reprimanded, uh  does permit him to stay on and continue that kind of leadership thats we so badly need as we enter into uh  negotiations uh  under the SALT II agreement, or if we have operations that might be developing uh in the Middle East or southern Africa, in the Pacific, uh  we need a man with that experience, that knowledge, that know-how, and I think, in light of the fact that he has uh  apologized, uh  would not have justified my asking for his resignation.",1976-10-22,Republican,247
4937,Mr. Ford,"The Governor may not have heard my uh  established criteria for the selection of a vice president, but uh  it was a well-established criteria that the person I selected would be fully qualified to be president of the United States. And Senator Bob Dole is so qualified: sixteen years in the House of Representatives and in the Senate, uhh  very high responsibilities on important committees. I dont mean to be critical of uh  Senator Mondale, but uh  I was uh  very, very surprised when I read that uh  Senator Mondale made a very derogatory, very personal comment about General Brown uh  after the news story that uh  broke about General Brown. If my recollection is correct he indicated that uh  General Brown was not qualified to be a sewer commissioner. I dont think thats a proper way to describe aayuh- chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff who has fought for his country for thirty-five years, and Im sure the governor would agree with me on that. Uh  I think Senator Dole would show more good judgment and discretion than to so describe uh  a heroic and brave and very outstanding leader of the military. So I think our selection uh  of Bob Dole as vice president uh  is based on merit. And if he should ever become uh  the president of the United States, with his vast experience as member the House and a member of the Senate, as well as a vice president, I think he would do an outstanding job as president of the United States.",1976-10-22,Republican,259
4942,Mr. Ford,"Well, first, uh  let me set the record straight. I vetoed the strip-mining bill, Mr. Kraft, because it was the overwhelming consensus of knowledgeable people that that strip-mining bill would have meant the loss of literally uh  thousands of jobs, something around a hundred and forty thousand jabs. Number two, that strip-mining bill wouldve severely set back our need for more coal, and Governor Carter has said repeatedly that coal is the resource that we need to use more in the effort to become independent of the uh  Arab oil supply. So, I vetoed it because of a loss of jobs and because it wouldve interfered with our energy independence program. The auto emissions  uh  it was agreed by Leonard Woodcock, the head of the UAW, and by the uh  heads of all of the automobile industry, we had labor and management together saying that those auto emission standards had to be modified. But lets talk about what the Ford administration has done in the field of environment. I have increased, as president, by over 60 percent the funding for water treatment plants in the United States, the federal contribution. I have fully funded the land and water conservation program; in fact, have recommended and the Congress approved a substantially increased land and water conservation program. Uh  I have uh  added in the current year budget the funds for the National Park Service. For example, we uh  proposed about $12 million to add between four and five hundred more employees for the National Park Service. And a month or so ago I did uh  likewise say over the next ten years we should expand  double  this national parks, the wild wilderness areas, the scenic river areas. And then, of course, the  the final thing is that I have signed and approved of more scenic rivers, more wilderness areas, since Ive been president than any other president in the history of the United States.",1976-10-22,Republican,323
4949,Mr. Ford,"Let me uh  speak out very strongly. The Ford administration does have a very comprehensive program to help uh  our major metropolitan areas. I fought for, and the Congress finally went along with a general revenue sharing program, whereby cities and uh  states, uh  the cities two-thirds and the states one-third, get over six billion dollars a year in cash through which they can uh  provide many, many services, whatever they really want. In addition we uh  in the federal government make available to uh  cities about uh  three billion three hundred million dollars in what we call community development. In adesh- in addition, uh  uh  as a result of my pressure an the Congress, we got a major mass transit program uh  over a four-year period, eleven billion eight-hundred million dollars. We have a good housing program, uh  that uh  will result in cutting uh  the down payments by 50 percent and uh  having mortgage payments uh lower at the beginning of any mortgage period. Were expanding our homestead uh  housing program. The net result is uh  we think under Carla Hills, whos the chairman of my uh  urban development and uh  neighborhood revitalization program, we will really do a first-class job in helping uh  the communities throughout the country. As a matter of fact, that committee under Secretary Hills released about a seventy-five-page report with specific recommendations so we can do a better job uh  the weeks ahead. And in addition, the tax program of the Ford administration, which provides an incentive for industry to move into our major uh  metropolitan areas, into the inner cities, will bring jobs where people are, and help to revitalize those cities as they can be.",1976-10-22,Republican,284
4952,Mr. Ford,"Let me say at the outset, uh  Im very proud of the record of this administration. In the cabinet I have one of the outstanding, I think, administrators as the secretary of transportation, Bill Coleman. Youre familiar, Im sure, with the recognition given in the Air Force to uh  General James, and there was just uh  approved a three-star admiral, the first in the history of the United States Navy, so uh  we are giving full recognition to individuals of quality in the Ford administration in positions of great responsibility. In addition, uh  the Department of Justice is fully enforcing, and enforcing effectively, the Voting Rights Act, the legislation that involves jobs, housing for minorities, not only blacks but all others. Uh  the Department of uh  uh  HUD is enforcing the new legislation that uhh  outlaws, that takes care of redlining. Uh  what were doing is saying that there are opportunities, business opportunities, educational opportunities, responsibilities uh  where people with talent, black or any other minority, can fully qualify. The Office of Minority Business in the Department of Commerce has made available more money in trying to help uh  black businessmen or other minority businessmen than any other administration since the office was established. The Office of Small Business, under Mr. Kobelinski, has a very massive program trying to help the black community. The individual who wants to start a business or expand his business as a black businessman is able to borrow, either directly or with guaranteed loans. I believe on the record that this administration has been more responsive and we have carried out the law to the letter, and Im proud of the record.",1976-10-22,Republican,277
4959,Mr. Ford,"support the uh  Republican uh  platform, which calls for the constitutional amendment that would uh  outlaw abortions. I favor the particular constitutional amendment that would turn over to the states the uh  individual right to the voters in those states uh  the chance to make a decision by public referendum. Uh I call that the people amendment. I think if you really believe that the people of a state ought to make a decision on a matter of this kind that uh  we ought to have a federal constitutional amendment that would permit each one of the fifty states to make the choice. Uh  I think this is a responsible and a proper way to proceed. Uhh  I believe also that uh  there is some merit to a  an amendment that uh  uh  Senator Everett Dirksen uh  proposed very frequently, an amendment that would uh  change the court decision as far as voluntary prayer in public schools. Uh  it seems to me that there should have  be an opportunity, uh  as long as its voluntary, as long as there is no uh  compulsion whatsoever, that uh  an individual ought to have that right. So in those two cases I think uh  such uh  a constitutional amendment would be proper, and I really dont think in either case theyre trivial matters. I think theyre matters of very deep conviction, as far as many, many people in this country believe. And therefore, they shouldnt be treated lightly. But theyre matters that are ah  important. And in those two cases, I would favor them.",1976-10-22,Republican,261
4962,Mr. Ford,"Uh  Mr. Maynard, uh  the record of gun control, whether its one city or another or in some states, does not show that the registration of a gun, handgun, or the registration of the gun owner, has in any way whatsoever decreased the crime rate or the use of that gun in the committing of a crime. The record just doesnt prove that such legislation or action by a local city council is effective. What we have to do, and this is the crux of the matter, is to make it very, very uh  difficult for a person who uses a gun in the commission of a crime to stay out of jail. If we make the use of a gun in the commission. of a crime a serious criminal offense, and that person is prosecuted, then, in my opinion, we are going after the person who uses the gun for the wrong reason. I dont believe in the registration of handguns or the registration of the handgun owner. That has not proven to be effective, and therefore, I think the better way is to go after the criminal, the individual who commits a crime in the possession of a gun and uses that gun for a part of his criminal activity. Those are the people who ought to be in jail. And the only way to do it is to pass strong legislation so that once apprehended, indicted, convicted, theyll be in jail and off the streets and not using guns in the commission of a crime.",1976-10-22,Republican,258
4964,Mr. Ford,"Yes, I have. And uh  the individuals that uh  with whom Ive consulted have not uh  convinced me that uh  a national registration of handguns or handgun owners will solve the problem youre talking about. The person who wants to use a gun for an illegal purpose can get it whether its registered or outlawed. They will be obtained. And they are the people who ought to go behind bars. You should not in the process penalize the legitimate handgun owner. And when you go through the process of registration, you in effect, are penalizing that individual who uses his gun for a very legitimate purpose.",1976-10-22,Republican,106
4973,Mr. Ford,"Well, I think the answer uh  as to the kind of person that I would select uh  is obvious. I had one opportunity to nominate uh  an individual to the Supreme Court and I selected the Circuit Court of Appeals judge from Illinois, uh  John Paul Stevens. I selected him because of his outstanding record as a Circuit Court of Appeals Judge, and I was very pleased that uh  an overwhelming Democratic United States Senate, after going into his background, came to the conclusion that he was uh  fit and should serve, and the vote in his behalf was overwhelming. So, I would say somebody in the format of uh  Justice Stevens would be the kind of an individual that I would uh  select in the future, as I did him in the past. I uh  believe, however, a comment ought to be made about the direction of the uh  Burger Court, vis-a-vis the uh  court uh  that preceded it. It seems to me that the Miranda case was a case that really made it very, very difficult for the  uh police, the law enforcement people in this country to uh  do what they could to make certain that the victim of a crime was protected and that those that commit crimes uh  were properly handled and uh  sent to jail. The Miranda case, uh  the Burger Court uh  is gradually changing, and Im pleased to see that there are some steps being made by the uh  Burger Court to modify the so-called Miranda decision. Uh  I might make a correction uh  of what uh  Governor Carter said, uh speaking of uh  uh  gun control, uh  yes, it is true, I believe that the sale of uh  Saturday Night S- Specials should be cut out, but he wants the registration of handguns.",1976-10-22,Republican,302
4976,Mr. Ford,"Well, Mr. Kraft, uh  I violently disagree with your assessment. And I dont think the record justifies the conclusion that you come to. Uh  let me uh  talk about uh  the economic announcements that were made just this past week. Yes, it was announced that the uh  GNP real growth in the third quarter was at 4 percent. But do you realize that over the last ten years thats a higher figure than the average growth during that ten-year period? Now its lower than the nine-point-point-two percent growth in the first quarter, and its lower than the uh 5 percent growth in the second quarter. But every economist  liberal, conservative that Im familiar with  recognizes that in the fourth quarter of this year and in the fifth quar- uh  the first quarter of next year that well have an increase in real GNP. But now lets talk about the pluses that came out this week. We had an 18 percent increase in housing starts. We had a substantial increase in new permits for housing. As a matter of fact, based on the announcement this week, there will be at an annual rate of a million, eight hundred and some thousand new houses built, which is a tremendous increase over last year and a substantial increase over the earlier part of this year. Now in addition, we had a very  some very good news in the reduction in the rate of inflation. And inflation hits everybody: those who are working and those who are on welfare. The rate of inflation, as announced just the other day, is under 5 percent; and the uh  4.4 percent that was indicated at the time of the 4 percent GNP was less than the 5.4 percent. It means that the American buyer is getting a better bargain today because inflation is less.",1976-10-22,Republican,307
4984,Mr. Ford,"I think uh  the uh  increase and the uh  prospects as far as Im concerned and the I  less favorable prospects for Governor Carter, reflect that Governor Carter uh  is inconsistent in many of the positions that he takes. He tends to distort on a number of occasions. Uh  just a moment ago, for example, uh  he uh  was indicating that uh  uh  in the 1950s, for example, uh  unemployment was very low. He fails to point out that uh  in the 1950s we were engaged in the war in Vietnam. We  I mean in Korea  we had uh  three million five hundred thousand young men uh  in the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marines. Thats not the way to end unemployment or to reduce unemployment. At the present time were at peace. We have reduced the number of people in the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marines from three million, one hundred  three million, five hundred thousand to two mil- lion one hundred thousand. We are not at war. We have reduced the military manpower by a million four hundred thousand. If we had that many more people in the Army, the Navy, the Air Force, and Marines, our unemployment figure would be considerably less. But this administration doesnt believe the way to reduce unemployment is to go to war, or to increase the number of people in the military. So you cannot compare unemployment, as you sought to, uh  with the present time with the 1950s, because the then administration had people in the military  they were at war, they were fighting overseas, and this administration has reduced the size of the military by a million four hundred thousand. Theyre in the civilian labor market and theyre not fighting anywhere around the world today.",1976-10-22,Republican,296
4986,Mr. Ford,"For twenty-five years I served in the Congress under five presidents. I saw them work, I saw them make very hard decisions. I didnt always agree with their decisions, whether they were Democratic or Republican presidents. For the last two years, Ive been the president, and I have found from experience that its much more difficult to make those decisions than it is to second-guess them. I became president at the time that the United States was in a very troubled time. We had inflation of over 12 percent, we were on the brink of the worst recession in the last forty years, we were still deeply involved in the problems of Vietnam. The American people had lost faith and trust and confidence in the presidency itself. That uh  situation called for me to first put the United States on a steady course and to keep our keel well balanced, because we had to face the difficult problems that had all of a sudden hit America. I think most people know that I did not seek the presidency. But I am asking for your help and assistance to be president for the next four years. During this campaign weve seen a lot of television shows, a lot of bumper stickers, and a great many uh  slogans of one kind or another. But those are not the things that count. What counts is, that the United States celebrated its 200th birthday on July fourth. As a result of that wonderful experience all over the United States, there is a new spirit in America. The American people are healed, are working together. The American people are moving again, and moving in the right direction. We have cut inflation by better than half. We have came out of the recession and were well on the road to real prosperity in this country again. There has been a restoration of faith and confidence and trust in the presidency because Ive been open, candid and forthright. I have never promised more than I could produce and I have produced everything that I promised. We are at peace. Not a single young American is fighting or dying on any foreign soil tonight. We have peace with freedom. Ive been proud to be president of the United States during these very troubled times. I love America just as all of you love America. It would be the highest honor for me to have your support on November second and for you to say, Jerry Ford, youve done a good job, keep on doing it. Thank you, and good night.",1976-10-22,Republican,432
5971,Reagan,"Well, I cannot see where a $.50 a gallon tax applied to gasoline would have changed the price of gasoline. It would still have gone up as much as it has, and the $.50 would be added on top of that. And it would be a tax paid by the consumers, and then were asked to believe that some way, they would get this back to the consumers. But why? Why take it in the first place if youre going to give it back? Why not leave it with them? And John spoke about 15 years ago, on the position that he. or 15 months ago, on what he believed in. Fifteen months ago, he was a cosigner and advocating the very tax cut that I am proposing, and said that that would be a forward step in fighting inflation, and that it would be beneficial to the working people of this country.",1980-09-21,Republican,153
5973,Reagan,"Well, I believe that conservation, at course, is worthy in and of itself. Anything that would preserve, or help us use less energy, that would be fine, and Im for it. But I do not believe that conservation alone is the answer to the present energy problem, because all youre doing then is staving off, by a short time, the day when you would come to the end of the energy supply. To say that we are limited, and at a dangerous point in this country with regard to energy, I think, is to ignore the fact. The fact is, that in todays oil wells, there is more oil still there than we have so far taken out and used. But it would require what is known as secondary or tertiary efforts to bring it out of the ground. And this is known oil reserves, known supplies. There are hundreds of millions of acres of land that have been taken out of circulation by the Government for whatever reason they have, that is believed by the most knowledgeable oil geologists to contain probably more oil and natural gas than we have used so far since we drilled that first well 121 years ago. We have a coal supply that is equal to 50% of the worlds coal supply, good for centuries, in this country. I grant you that prices may go up, because as you go further and have to go deeper, you are adding to the cost of production. We have nuclear power, which, I believe, with the safest. the most stringent of safety requirements, could meet our energy needs for the next couple of decades while we go forward exploring the areas of solar power and other forms of energy that might be renewable and that would not be exhaustible. All of these things can be done. When you stop and think that we are only drilling on 2%. have leased only 2% of the possible. possibility for oil of the continental shelf around the United States; when you stop to think that the government has taken over 100 million acres of land out of circulation in Alaska, alone, that is believed by geologists to contain much in the line of minerals and energy sources, then I think it is the Government, and the Government with its own restrictions and regulations, that is creating the energy crisis. That we are, indeed, an energy-rich nation.",1980-09-21,Republican,406
5978,Reagan,"Well, as Ive said, I am not an enemy of conservation. I wouldnt be called a conservative if I were. But, when my figures are challenged, as the President himself challenged them after I made them, I think it should be called to the attention of John and the others here that my figures are the figures of the Department of Energy, which has not been overly optimistic in recent years as to how much supply we have left. That is the same Government that, in 1920, told us we only had enough oil left for 13 years, and 19 years later, told us we only had enough left for another 15 years. As for saving energy and conserving, the American people havent been doing badly at that. Because in industry today, were producing more, over the last several years, and at 12% less use of energy than we were back in about 1973. And motorists are using 8% less than they were back at that time of the oil embargo. So, I think we are proving that we can go forward with conservation and benefit from that. But also, I think it is safe to say that we do have sources of energy that have not yet been used or found.",1980-09-21,Republican,212
5985,Reagan,"Mr. Corddry, its a shame now that there are only two of us here debating, because the two that are here are in more agreement than disagreement on this particular issue, and the only one who would be disagreeing with us is the President, if he were present. I. too, believe in the voluntary military. As a matter of fact, today the shortages of non-commissioned officers that John mentioned are such that if we tried to have a draft today, we wouldnt have the non-commissioned officers to train the draftees. I believe the answer lies in just recognizing human nature and how we make everything else work in this country, when we want it to work. Recognize that we have a voluntary military. We are asking for men and women to join the military as a career, and were asking them to deal with the most sophisticated of equipment. And a young man is out there on a $1 billion carrier in charge of the maintenance of a $20 million aircraft, working 100 hours a week at times, and hes earning less for himself and his family, while hes away from his family, than he could earn if he were in one of the most menial jobs, working 40 hours a week here at home. As an aid to enlistment. we had an aid  46% of the people who enlisted in the voluntary military up until 1977 said they did so for one particular reason, the G.I. Bill of Rights  the fact that, by serving in the military, they could provide for a future college education. In 1977, we took that away from the military. That meant immediately 46% of your people that were signing up had no reason for signing up. So I think it is a case of pay scale, of recognizing that if were going to have young men and women responsible for our security, dealing with this sophisticated equipment, then for heavens sakes, lets go out and have a pay scale that is commensurate with the sacrifice that were asking of them. Along with this, I think we need something else that has been allowed to deteriorate. We need a million-man active reserve that could be called up on an instants notice, and that would be also trained, ready to use that type of equipment. Both of these, I think, would respond to the proper kind of incentives that we could offer these people. The other day, I just  Ill hasten  I just saw one example. Down in Texas. I saw a high school that is military.",1980-09-21,Republican,431
5993,Reagan,"Well, let me just say that, with regard to that same missile system, I happen to support and believe in the missile, itself. But thats not the $54 billion cost that John is talking about. Hes talking about that fantastic plan of the Administration to take thousands and thousands of square miles out in the Western states. And first, he was going to dig a racetrack and have it going around in the racetrack so it would meet the requirements of SALT II treaty, and now hes decided itll have a straight up and down thing, so it can he both verifiable and yet hideable from the Soviet Union. We need the missile, I think, because we are so out of balance strategically that we lack a deterrent to a possible first assault. But I am not in favor of the plan that is so costly. And therefore, if I only had another second left, Id say that that high school class in a military training  40 of its 80 graduates last year entered the United States service academies; West Point, Annapolis and the Air Force Academy, and to see those young men made me very proud to realize that there are young people in this country that are prepared to go into that kind of a career in service of their country.",1980-09-21,Republican,223
5995,Reagan,"I dont think Id have to go against that pledge. I think one of the problems today with the cities is Federal aid. The mayors that Ive talked to in some of our leading cities tell! me that the Federal grants that come with. for a specific cause or a specific objective, come with such red tape, such priorities established by a bureaucracy in Washington, that the local governments hands are tied with regard to using that money as they feel could best be used, and for what they think might be the top priority. If they had that money without those government restrictions, every one of them has told me they could make great savings and make far greater use of the money. What I have been advocating is, why dont we start with the Federal Government turning back tax sources to states and local governments, as well as the responsibilities for those programs? Seventy-five percent of the people live in the cities. I dont know of a city in America that doesnt have the kind of problems youre talking about. But, where are we getting the money that the Federal Government is putting out to help them? New York is being taxed for money that will then go to Detroit. But Detroit is being taxed for money that, lets say, will go to Chicago, while Chicago is being taxed to help with the problems in Philadelphia. Wouldnt it make a lot more sense if the government let them keep their own money there in the first place? But there are other things that we can do with the inner cities, and Ive believed. I have talked of having zones in those cities that are run down, where there is a high percentage of people on welfare, and offer tax incentives. The government isnt getting a tax now from businesses there because they arent there, or from individuals who are on welfare rather than working. And why dont we offer incentives for business and industry to start up in those zones? Give them a tax moratorium for a period if they build and develop there. The individuals that would then get jobs  give them a break that encourages them to leave the social welfare programs and go to work. We could have an urban homestead act. Weve got thousands and thousands of homes owned by government boarded up, being vandalized, that have been taken in mortgage foreclosures. What if we had a homestead act, and said to the people, for $1 we sell you this house. All have to do is agree to refurbish it, make it habitable, and live in it  just as 100 or more years ago, we did with the open land in this country  urban . or country homesteading.",1980-09-21,Republican,464
6000,Reagan,"Yes. Government claims. John claims that he is making plain where the money will come from. It will come from the pockets of the people. It will come from the pockets of the people who are living in those very areas. And the problem is, with Governments  Federal, State and Local  taking $.44 out of every dollar earned, that the Federal Government has pre-empted too many of the tax sources, and that the cities. if Pittsburgh does not have the money to fix the leaking water mains, its because the Federal Government has pre-empted. Now, the Federal Government is going to turn around and say, well you have this problem; we will now hand you the money to do it. But the Federal Government doesnt make money. It just takes  from the people. And in my view, this is not the answer to the problem. Stand in the South Bronx as I did, in the spot where Jimmy Carter made his promise that he was going to, with multi-billion dollar programs, refurbish that area that looks like bombed-out London in World War II. I stood there, and I met the people. And I heard them ask just for something that would give them hope. And I believe that, while all of the promises have been broken, theyve never been carried out. But I believe that my plan might offer an opportunity for that, if we would move into those areas and let, encourage  with the tax incentive  the private sector, to develop and to create the jobs for the people.",1980-09-21,Republican,260
6007,Reagan,"Miss Quinn, I dont have to. Ive done it. We have a back-up paper to my economic speech of a couple of weeks ago in Chicago, that gives all of the figures. And we used  yes, we used  the Senate Budget Committees projections for five years, which are based on an average inflation rate of 7.5%  which, I think, that under our plan, can be eliminated. And eliminated probably more quickly than our plan, but we wanted to be so conservative with it, that people would see how. how well it could be done. Now, Johns been in the Congress for 20 years. And John tells us that first, weve got to reduce spending before we can reduce taxes. Well, if youve got a kid thats extravagant, you can lecture him all you want to about his extravagance. Or you can cut his allowance and achieve the same end much quicker. But Government has never reduced Government does not tax to get the money it needs. Government always needs the money it gets. And when John talks about his non-inflationary plan, as far as I have been able to learn, there are 88 proposals in it that call for additional Government spending programs. Now, I speak with some confidence of our plan, because I took over a state  California  10% of the population of this nation  a state that, if it were a nation, would be the seventh-ranking economic power in the world. And that state we controlled spending. We cut the rate of increase in spending in half. But at the same time, we gave back to the people of California  in tax rebates, tax credits, tax cuts  $5.7 billion. I vetoed 993 measures without having a veto overturned. And among those vetoes, I stopped $16 billion in additional spending. And the funny thing was that California, which is normally above the national average in inflation and unemployment, for those six years for the first time, was below the national average in both inflation and unemployment. We have considered inflation in our figures. We deliberately took figures that we, ourselves, believed were too conservative. I believe the budget can be balanced by 1982 or 1983, and it is a combination of planned reduction of the tax increase that Carter has built into the economy, and thats what hes counting on for his plan. But hes going to get a half-a-trillion dollars more over the next five years that he can use for additional programs, or hopefully, someplace down the line, balancing the budget. We believe that thats too much additional money to take out of the pockets of the people.",1980-09-21,Republican,441
6011,Reagan,"Well, some people look up figures, and some people make up figures. And John has just made up some very interesting figures. We took the Senate report, of course. But we did factor in our own ideas with regard to increases in the projected military spending that we believe would, over a period of time, do what is necessary. Now also, with regard to the figures about California. The truth of the matter is, we did cut the increase in spending in half. It at the John doesnt quite realize  hes never held an executive position of that kind. And I think being Governor of California is probably the closest thing to the Presidency, if thats possible, of any executive job in America today  because it is the most populous state. And I can only tell him that we reduced, in proportion of other states, the per capita spending, the per capita size of Government  we only increased the size of Government one-twelfth what it had increased in the preceding eight years. And one journal, the San Francisco Chronicle, a respected newspaper, said there was no question about the fact that Governor Reagan had prevented the State of California from going bankrupt.",1980-09-21,Republican,202
6015,Reagan,"Oh, Im its my question. But whether I agree or disagree with some individual, or what he may say, or how he may say it, I dont think theres any way that we can suggest that because people believe in God and go to church, that they should not want reflected in those people and those causes they support, their own belief in morality, and in the high traditions and principles which weve abandoned so much in this country. Going around this country, I think that I have found a great hunger in America for a spiritual revival. For a belief that law must be based on a higher law. For a return to traditions and values that we once had. Our Government, in its most sacred documents  the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence and all  speak of man being created, of a Creator. That were a nation under God. Now, I have thought for a long time that too many of our churches have been too reluctant to speak up in behalf of what they believe is proper in Government, and they have been too too lax in interfering, in recent years, with Governments invasion of the family itself, putting itself between parent and child. I vetoed a number of bills of that kind myself, when I was in California. Now, whether it is rightful, on a single issue, for anyone to advocate that someone should not be elected or not, I wont take a position on that. But I do believe that no one in this country should be denied the right to express themselves, or to even try to persuade others to follow their leader. Thats what elections are all about.",1980-09-21,Republican,285
6020,Reagan,"The litmus test that John says is in the Republican platform, says no more than the judges to be appointed should have a respect for innocent life. Now, I dont think thats a bad idea. I think all of us should have a respect for innocent life. With regard to the freedom of the individual for choice with regard to abortion, theres one individual whos not being considered at all. Thats the one who is being aborted. And Ive noticed that everybody that is for abortion has already been born. I I think that, technically, I know this is a difficult and an emotional problem, and many people sincerely feel on both sides of this, but I do believe that maybe we could find the answer through medical evidence, if we would determine once and for all, is an unborn child a human being? I happen to believe it is.",1980-09-21,Republican,150
6024,Reagan,"Before beginning my closing remarks, here, I would just like to remark a concern that I have that we have criticized the failures of the Carter policy here rather considerably, both of us this evening. And there might be some feeling of unfairness about this because he was not here to respond. But I believe it would have been much more unfair to have had John Anderson denied the right to participate in this debate. And I want to express my appreciation to the League of Women Voters for adopting a course with which I believe the great majority of Americans are in agreement. Now, as to my closing remarks: Ive always believed that this land was placed here between the two great oceans by some divine plan. That it was placed here to be found by a special kind of people  people who had a special love for freedom and who had the courage to uproot themselves and leave hearth and homeland, and came to what, in the beginning, was the most undeveloped wilderness possible. We came from 100 different corners of the earth. We spoke a multitude of tongues. We landed on this Eastern shore and then went out over the mountains and the prairies and the deserts and the far western mountains to the Pacific, building cities and towns and farms, and schools and churches. If wind, water or fire destroyed them, we built them again. And in so doing, at the same time, we built a new breed of human called an American  a proud, an independent., and a most compassionate individual, for the most part. Two hundred years ago, Tom Paine, when the 13 tiny colonies were trying to become a nation, said, we have it in our power to begin the world over again. Today. were confronted with the horrendous problems that weve discussed here tonight. And some people in high positions of leadership, tell us that the answer is to retreat. That the best is over. That we must cut back. That we must share in an ever-increasing scarcity. That we must, in the failure to be able to protect our national security as it is today, we must not be provocative to any possible adversary. Well, we, the living Americans, have gone through four wars. Weve gone through a Great Depression in our lifetime that literally was worldwide and almost brought us to our knees. But we came through all of those things and we achieved even new heights and new greatness. The living Americans today have fought harder, paid a higher price for freedom, and done more to advance the dignity of man than any people who ever lived on this earth. For 200 years, weve lived in the future, believing that tomorrow would be better than today, and today would be better than yesterday. I still believe that. Im not running for the Presidency because I believe that I can solve the problems weve discussed tonight. I believe the people of this country can, and together, we can begin the world over again. We can meet our destiny  and that destiny to build a land here that will be, for all mankind, a shining city on a hill. I think we ought to get at it.",1980-09-21,Republican,546
6949,Mr. Ford,"I dont believe that uh that Mr. Carters been any more specific in this case than he has been on many other instances. I notice particularly that he didnt endorse the Humphrey-Hawkins bill which he has on occasions and which is included as a part of the Democratic platform. That legislation uh allegedly would help our unemployment, but uh  we all know that it wouldve controlled our economy, it wouldve added uh  ten to thirty billion dollars each year in additional expenditures by the Federal Government. It wouldve called for export controls on agricultural products In my judgment the best way to get jobs is to uh  expand the private sector, where five out of six jobs today exist in our economy. We can do that by reducing Federal taxes as I proposed uh  about a year ago when I called for a tax reduction of $28 billion  three-quarters of it to go to private uh taxpayers and uh one-quarter to the business sector. We could add to jobs in the major metropolitan areas by a proposal that I recommended that would give tax incentives to business to move into the inner city and to expand or to build new plants so that they would take a plant, or expand a plant where people are, and people are currently unemployed. We could uh  also uh  help our youths with some of the proposals that uh  would give to young people an opportunity to work and learn at the same time just like we give money to young people who are going to college. Those are the kind of specifics that I think we have to discuss on these uh  debates, and these are the kind of programs that Ill talk about on my time.",1976-09-23,Republican,294
6952,Mr. Ford,"At the time, Mr. Gannon, that I made the recommendation for a $28 billion tax cut  three-quarters of it to go to individual taxpayers and 25 percent to American business. I said at the time that we had to hold the lid an federal spending, that for every dollar of a tax reduction we had to have an equal reduction in federal expenditures  a one-for-one proposition. And I recommended that to the Congress with a budget ceiling of three hundred and ninety-five billion dollars, and that would have permitted us to have a $25 billion tax reduction. In my tax reduction program for middle-income taxpayers, I recommended that the Congress increase personal exemptions from seven hundred and fifty dollars per person to one thousand dollars per person. That would mean, of course, that for a family of four that that family would have a thousand dollars more personal exemption  money that they could spend for their own purposes, money that the government wouldnt have to spend. But if we keep the lid on federal spending, which I think we can  with the help of the Congress, we can justify fully a $28 billion tax reduction. In the budget that I submitted to the Congress in January this year, I re- recommended a 50 percent cutback in the rate of growth of federal spending. For the last ten years the budget of the United States has grown from uh  about 11 percent per year. We cant afford that kind of growth in federal spending. And in the budget that I recommended we cut it in half  a growth rate of 5 to 5 and one-half percent. With that kind of limitation, on federal spending, we can fully justify the tax reductions that I have proposed. And it seems to me with the stimulant of more money in the hands of the taxpayers, and with more money in the hands of business to expand, to modernize, to provide more jobs, our economy stimulated so that well get more revenue and well have a more prosperous economy.",1976-09-23,Republican,344
6954,Mr. Ford,"That tax bill does not entirely meet the criteria that I established. I think the Congress should have uh  added another $10 billion reduction in personal income taxes, including the increase of personal exemptions from seven hundred and fifty to a thousand dollars. And Congress could have done that if the budget committees of the Congress, and the Congress as a whole, had not increased the spending that I recommended in the budget. Im sure that you know that in the resolutions passed by the Congress, that have added about $17 billion in more spending, by the Congress over the budget that I recommended. So I would prefer in that tax bill to have an additional tax cut and a further limitation on federal spending. Now this tax bill  that hasnt reached the White House yet, but is expected in a day or two  its about fifteen hundred pages. It has some good provisions in it. It has  uh left out some that I have recommended, unfortunately. On the other hand, uh when you have a bill of that magnitude, with  tho- those many provisions, a president has to sit and decide if theres more good than bad. And from the a- analysis that Ive made so far, it seems to me that that tax bill does uh  justify my signature and my approval.",1976-09-23,Republican,224
6965,Mr. Ford,"If it is uh true that there will be a $60 billion surplus by fiscal year 1981, rather than spend that money for all the new programs that Governor Carter recommends and endorses, and which are included in the Democratic platform, I think the American taxpayer ought to get an additional tax break  a tax reduction of that magnitude. I feel that the taxpayers are the ones that need the relief: I dont think we should add additional programs of the magnitude that Governor Carter talks about. It seems to me that our tax structure today has rates that are too high. But I am uh  very glad to point out that since 1969, during a Republican administrations, we have had ten million people taken off of the tax rolls at the lower end of the taxpayer area. And at the same time, assuming that I sign the tax bill that was mentioned by Mr. Gannon, we will in the last two tax bills have increased the minimum tax on all wealthy taxpayers. And I believe that by eliminating ten million taxpayers in the last uh eight years, and by putting a heavier tax burden on those in the higher tax brackets, plus the other actions thatve been taken uh  we can give taxpayers adequate tax relief. Now it seems to me that uh  as we look at the recommendations of the budget committees and our own projections, there isnt going to be any $60 billion dividend. Ive heard of those dividends in the past; it always happens. We expected one at the time of the Vietnam War, but it was used up before we ever ended the war and taxpayers never got the adequate relief they deserved.",1976-09-23,Republican,288
6968,Mr. Ford,"The amnesty program that I recommended in Chicago in September of 1974 would give to all draft evaders and  uh military deserters the opportunity to earn their uh  good record back. About fourteen to fifteen thousand did take advantage of that program. We gave them ample time. I am against- an across-the-board pardon of draft evaders or military deserters. Now in the case of Mr. Nixon, the reason the  the pardon was given, was that, when I took office this country was in a very, very divided condition. There was hatred, there was divisiveness  uh people had lost faith in their government in many, many respects. Mr. Nixon resigned, and I became president. It seemed to me that if I was to uh adequately and effectively handle the problems of high inflation, a growing recession, the uh  involvement of the United States still in Vietnam that I had to give a hundred percent of my time to those two major problems. Mr. Nixon resigned. That is disgrace. The first President out of thirty-eight that ever resigned from public office under pressure. So when you look at the penalty that he paid, and when you analyze the requirements that I had  to spend all of my time working on the economy, which was in trouble, that I inherited; working on our problems in Southeast Asia  which were still plaguing us  it seemed to me that Mr. Nixon had been penalized enough by his resignation in disgrace and the need, and necessity for me to concentrate on the problems of the country fully justified the action that I took.",1976-09-23,Republican,267
6970,Mr. Ford,"Well, Mr. Carter has uh indicated that uh  he would give a blanket pardon to all uh  draft evaders. I do not agree with that point of view. I gave, in September of 1974, an opportunity for all draft evaders, all deserters, to come in voluntarily, clear their records by earning an opportunity to restore their good citizenship. I think we gave them a good opportunity  were  I dont think we should go any further.",1976-09-23,Republican,75
6979,Mr. Ford,"I think the record should show, Mr. Newman, that uh  the Bureau of Census  we checked it just yesterday  indicates that uh  in the four years that uh  Governor Carter was governor of the state of Georgia, uh  expenditures by the government went up over 50 percent Uh  employees of the government in Georgia during his term of office went up over 25 percent; and the figures also show that the uh, uh  bonded indebtedness of the state of Georgia during his governorship went up over 20 percent. And there was some very interesting testimony given by Governor Carters successor, Governor Busby, before a Senate committee a few uh  months ago on how he found the Medicaid program when he came into office following Governor Carter. He testified, and these are his words  the present governor of Georgia  he says he found the Medicaid program in Georgia in shambles. Now let me talk about what weve done in the White House as far as federal employees are concerned The first order that I issued after I became president was to cut or eliminate the prospective forty-thousand increase in federal employees that had been scheduled by my predecessor. And in the term that Ive been president  some two years  we have reduced federal employment by eleven thousand. In the White House staff itself, when I became president, we had roughly five hundred and forty employees. We now have about four hundred and eighty-five employees, so weve made a rather significant reduction in the number of employees on the White House staff working for the president. So I think our record of cutting back employees, plus the failure on the part of the Governors programs to actually save employment in Georgia, shows which is the better plan.",1976-09-23,Republican,295
6982,Mr. Ford,"Well, in the uh  last two years, as I indicated before, we had a very tough time. We were faced with uh  heavy inflation, over 12 percent; we were faced with substantial unemployment. But in the last uh  twenty-four months weve turned the economy around and weve brought inflation down to under 6 percent, and we have reduced the uh  well, we have added employment of about four million in the last seventeen months to the point where we have eighty-eight million people working in America today  the most in the history of the country. The net result is we are going to have some improvement in our receipts. And I think well have some decrease in our disbursements. We expect to have a lower deficit in fiscal year 1978. We feel that with this improvement in the economy; we feel with more receipts and fewer disbursements we can in a moderate way increase, as I recommended, over the next ten years a new parks program that would cast a billion and a half dollars, doubling our national park system. We have recommended that in the h- housing program we can reduce down payments and moderate monthly payments. But that doesnt cost any more as far as the federal treasury is concerned. We believe that we can uh do a better job in the area of crime, but that requires a tougher sentencing, mandatory certain prison sentences for those who violate our criminal laws. We  uh believe that uh you can revise the federal criminal code, which has not been revised in a good many years. That doesnt cost any more money. We believe that you can uhh  do something more effectively with a moderate increase in money in the drug abuse program. We feel that uh  in education we can have a slight increase  not a major increase. Its my understanding that Governor Carter has indicated that uh  he approves of a $30 billion uh  expenditure by the federal government as far as education is concerned. At the present time were spending roughly three billion five hundred million dollars. I dont know where that money would come from. But as we look at the quality-of-life programs  jobs, health, education, crime, recreation  we feel that as we move forward with a healthier economy, we can absorb the small necessary cost that will be required.",1976-09-23,Republican,394
6984,Mr. Ford,"We feel that uh  with the programs that I have recommended, the additional $10 billion tax cut, with the moderate increases in the quality-of-life area, we can still have a balanced budget which I will submit to the Congress in January of 1978. We wont wait one year or two years longer, as Governor Carter uh  indicates. As the economy improves, and it is improving, our gross national product this year will average about 6 percent increase over last year. We will have the lower rate of inflation for the uh  calendar year this year  something slightly under 6 percent. Employment will be up, revenues will be up. Well keep the lid on some of these programs that we can hold down as we have a little extra money to spend for those quality-of-life programs which I think are needed and necessary. Now I cannot, and would not, endorse the kind of program that uh  Governor Carter recommends. He endorses the Democratic uh  platform which, as I read it, calls for approximately sixty additional programs. We estimate that those programs would add a hundred billion dollars minimum and probably two hundred billion dollars  uhh maximum each year to the federal budget. Those programs you cannot afford and give tax relief. We feel that you can hold the line and restrain federal spending, give a tax reduction and still have a balanced budget by 1978.",1976-09-23,Republican,234
6993,Mr. Ford,"Governor Carter skims over a very serious and a very broad subject. In January of uh  1975 I submitted to the Congress and to the American people the first comprehensive energy program recommended by any president. It called for an increase in the production of energy in the United States. It called for uh  conservation measures so that we would save the energy that we have. If youre going to increase domestic oil and gas production  and we have to  you have to give those producers an opportunity to uh  develop their land or their wells. I recommended to the Congress that we should increase production in this country from six hundred million tons a year to twel- a- a billion two hundred million tons by 1985. In order to do that we have to improve our extraction of coal from the ground; we have to improve our utilization of coal  make it more efficient, make it cleaner. In addition we uh  have to expand our research and development. In my program for energy independence we have increased, for example, solar energy research from about $84 million a year to about a hundred and twenty million dollars a year. Were going as fast as the experts say we should. In nuclear power we have increased the research and development, uh  under the Energy Research and Development Agency uh  very substantially, to insure that our ener- uh  nuclear power plants are safer, that they are more efficient, and that we have adequate safeguards. I think you have to have greater oil and gas production, more coal production, more nuclear production, and in addition you have to have energy conservation.",1976-09-23,Republican,278
6996,Mr. Ford,"The bills that I vetoed, the one for an additional $6 billion, was not a bill that would have solved our unemployment problems. Even the proponents of it admitted that no more than four hundred thousand jobs would be uh  made available. Our analysis indicates that something in the magnitude of about one hundred fifty to two hundred thousand jobs would uh  be made available. Each one of those jobs wouldve cost the taxpayers $25 thousand. In addition, the jobs would not be available right now. They would not have materialized for about nine to eighteen months. The immediate problem we have is to stimulate our economy now so that we can get rid of unemployment. What we have done is to hold the lid on spending in an effort to reduce the rate of inflation. And we have proven, I think very conclusively, that you can reduce the rate of inflation and increase jobs. For example, as I have said, we have added some four million jobs in the last seventeen months. We have now employed eighty-eight million people in America, the largest number in the history of the United States. Weve added five hundred thousand jobs in the last two months. Inflation is the quickest way to destroy jobs. And by holding the lid on federal spending we have been able to do an- a good job, an affirmative job in inflation and as a result have added to the jobs in this country. I think its uh  also appropriate to point out that through our tax policies we have stimulated uhh  added employment throughout the country, the investment tax credit, the tax incentives for expansion and modernization of our industrial capacity. Its my  my opinion that the private sector, where five out of six jobs are, where you have permanent jobs, with the opportunity for advancement, is a better place than make-work jobs under the program recommended by the Congress.",1976-09-23,Republican,323
6998,Mr. Ford,"Well, that bill has not yet come down to the Oval Office, so I am not in a position to make any judgment on it tonight. But that is an extra $4 billion that would uh  add to the deficit which would add to the inflationary pressures, which would help to destroy jobs in the private sector  not make jobs, where the jobs really are. These make-work, temporary jobs  dead end as they are  are not the kind of jobs that we want for our people. I think its interesting to point out that uh  in the uh  two years that Ive been president Ive vetoed fifty-six bills. Congress has sustained forty-two vetoes. As a result, we have saved over $9 billion in federal expenditures. And the Congress by overriding the bills that I did veto, the Congress has added some $13 billion to the federal expenditures and to the federal deficit. Now Governor Carter complains about the deficits that uh  uh  this administration has had. And yet he condemns the vetoes that I have made that has  that have saved the taxpayer $9 billion and could have saved an additional $13 billion. Now he cant have it both ways. And therefore, it seems to me that we should hold the lid, as we have, to the best of our ability so we can stimulate the private economy and get the jobs where the jobs are  five out of six in this economy.",1976-09-23,Republican,243
7011,Mr. Ford,"Governor Carters answer tonight does not coincide with the answer that he gave in an interview to the Associated Press a week or so ago. In that interview uh  Governor Carter indicated that uh  he would raise the taxes on those in the medium or middle-income brackets or higher. Now if you uh  take the medium or middle-income taxpayer  thats about $14 thousand per person  uh  Governor Carter has indicated, publicly, in an interview that he would increase the taxes on about 50 percent of the working people of this country. I think uh  the way to get tax equity in this country is to give tax relief to the middle-income people who have an income from roughly $8 thousand up to twenty-five or thirty thousand dollars. They have been short-changed as we have taken ten million taxpayers off the tax rolls in the last eight years, and as we have uh  added to the minimum tax uh  provision to make all people pay more taxes. I believe in tax equity for the middle-income taxpayer, increasing the personal exemption. Mr. Carter wants to increase taxes for roughly half of the taxpayers of this country. Now, the Governor has also played a little fast and loose with the facts about vetoes. The records show that President Roosevelt vetoed an average of fifty-five bills a year. President Truman vetoed on the average, while he was president, about thirty-eight bills a year. I understand that Governor Carter, when he was Governor of Georgia, vetoed between thirty-five and forty bills a year. My average in two years is twenty-six. But in the process of that we have saved uhh  $9 billion. And one final comment, uh  Governor Carter talks about the tax bills and all of the inequities that exist in the present law. I must remind him the Democrats have controlled the Congress for the last twenty-two years and they wrote all the tax bills.",1976-09-23,Republican,322
7014,Mr. Ford,"There is a considerable anti-Washington feeling throughout the country. But I think the feeling is misplaced. In the last two years, we have restored integrity in the White House, and weve set high standards in the executive branch of the government. The anti-Washington feeling, in my opinion, ought to be focused on the Congress of the United States. For example, this Congress, very shortly, will spend a billion dollars a year for its housekeeping, its salaries, its expenses and the like. It  the next Congress will probably be the first billion-dollar Congress in the history of the United States. I dont think the American people are getting their moneys worth from the majority party that run this Congress. We, in addition, see that uh  in the last uh  four years the number of employees hired by the Congress has gone up substantial- uh much more than uh  the gross national product, much more than any other increase throughout our society. Congress is hiring people by the droves, and the cast as a result has gone up. And I dont see any improvement in the performance of the Congress under the present leadership. So it seems to me instead of the anti-Washington feeling being aimed at everybody in Washington, it seems to me that the focus should be where the problem is, which is the Congress of the United States, and particularly the majority in the Congress. They spend too much money on themselves. They have too many employees. Theres some question about their morality. It seems to me that in this election, the focus should not be on the executive branch but the corrections should come as the voters vote for their members of the House of Representatives or for their United States senator. Thats where the problem is and I hope therell be some corrective action taken so we can get some new leadership in the Congress of the United States.",1976-09-23,Republican,322
7016,Mr. Ford,"Well, It seems to me that uh  we have a chance  the Republicans  to get a majority in the House of Representatives. We will make some gains in the United States Senate. So there will be different ratios in the House, as well as in the Senate, and as president I will be able to uh  work with that Congress. But let me take the other side of the coin, if I might. Supposing we had  had a Democratic Congress for the last two years and wed had uh  Governor Carter as President. He has, in effect, said that he would agree with all of  he would disapprove of the vetoes that I have made, and would have added significantly to expenditures and the deficit in the federal government. I think it would be contrary to one of the basic concepts in our system of government  a system of checks and balances. We have a Democratic Congress today, and fortunately weve had a Republican president to check their excesses with my vetoes. If we have a Democratic Congress next year, and a president who wants to spend an additional one hundred billion dollars a year, or maybe two hundred billion dollars a year, with more programs, we will have in my judgment, greater deficits with more spending, more dangers of inflation. I think the American people want a Republican president to check on any excesses that come out of the next Congress, if it is a Democratic Congress.",1976-09-23,Republican,248
7023,Mr. Ford,"The chairman of the Federal Reserve Board should be independent. Fortunately, he has been during Democratic as well as Republican administrations. As the result in the last uh  two years uh  we have had a responsible monetary policy. Uh the Federal Reserve Board indicated that the supply of money would be held between four to four and a half and seven and seven and a half. They have done a good job in integrating the money supply with the uh  fiscal policy of the uh  executive and legislative branches of the government. It would be catastrophic if the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board became the tool of the political uh  party that was in power. Its important for our future uhh  economic security that that job be nonpolitical and uh  separate from the executive and the Legislative branches.",1976-09-23,Republican,139
7026,Mr. Ford,"You are familiar, of course, with the fact that I am the first president in thirty years who has reorganized the intelligence agencies in the federal government: the CIA, the Defense Intelligence Agency, the National Security Agency and the others. Weve done that by executive order. Uhh  and I think uh  weve tightened it up; weve uh  straightened out their problems that developed over the last few years. It doesnt seem to me that its needed or necessary to have legislation in this particular regard. Uhh  I have recommended to the Congress, however  Im sure youre familiar with this  legislation that would uhh  make it uhh  very uhh  proper in  in the right way, that the attorney general could go in and get the right for wiretapping under security cases. This was an effort that was made by the attorney general and myself, working with the Congress. But even in this area, where I think new legislation would be justified, uh the Congress has not responded. So, I feel in that case, as well as in the reorganization of the intelligence agencies, as Ive done, we have to do it by executive order. And Im glad that we have a good director in George Bush. We have good executive orders, and the CIA and the DIA and NASA uh  uh  NSA are now doing a good job under proper supervision.",1976-09-23,Republican,230
7034,Mr. Ford,"On November second all of you will make a very, very important decision. One of the major issues in this campaign is trust. A president should never promise more than he can deliver and a president should always deliver everything that hes promised. A president cant be all things to all people. A president should be the same thing to all people. Another issue in this campaign, Governor Carter has endorsed the Democratic platform, which calls for more spending, bigger deficits, more inflation or mare taxes. Governor Carter has embraced the record of the present Congress, dominated by his political party. It calls for more of the same. Governor Carter in his acceptance speech called for more and more programs, which means more and more government. I think the real issue in this campaign, and that which you must decide on November second, is whether you should vote for his promise or my performance in two years in the White House. On the fourth of July we had a wonderful two hundredth birthday  for our great country. It was a superb occasion. It was a glorious day. In the first century of our nations history our forefathers gave us the finest form of government in the history of mankind. In the second century of our nations history, our forefathers developed the most productive industrial nation in the history of the globe. Our third century should be the century of individual freedom for all our two hundred and fifteen million Americans today and all that join us. In the last few years government has gotten bigger and bigger; industry has gotten larger and larger; labor unions have gotten bigger and bigger; and our children have been the victims of mass education. We must make this next century the century of the individual. We should never forget that a government big enough to give us everything we want is a government big enough to take from us everything we have. The individual worker in the plants throughout the United States should not be a small cog in a big machine. The member of a labor union must have his rights strengthened and broadened and our children in their education should have an opportunity to improve themselves based on their talents and their abilities. My mother and father, during the Depression, worked very hard to give me an opportunity to do better in our great country. Your mothers and fathers did the same thing for you and others. Betty and I have worked very hard to give our children a brighter future in the United States, our beloved country. You and others in this great country have worked hard and done a great deal to give your children and your grandchildren the blessings of a better America. I believe we can all work together to make the individuals in the future have more and all of us working together can build a better America.",1976-09-23,Republican,491
