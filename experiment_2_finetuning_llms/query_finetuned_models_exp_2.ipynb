These are the most important issues that face us, and I have had one term already in which to respond to them. I have issued more executive orders in behalf of the disabled an helping the disabled than had been issued up to the time I entered office. I helped uh uh uh get through the Congress of the United States uh new regulations for the architect, uh requiring that all public buildings, built by the public uh uh uh sector, must be accessible to the disabled, to the physically handicapped uh uh gotta lotta new programs there. But let me go uh mention this  I forgot last night  the uh oh yes; I wanted to get in also your problem with uh gay rights. That uh the position Ive taken does not uh specifically discriminate against any group. Its a question of uh protecting life, and under our Chapter uh under our Federal regulations, uh living in the same house is not the same thing as being married. Now  Ive already uh also asked for a hundred thousand  300 thousand more police officers, added more than half a billion dollars this year to help local communities with drug programs, and emphasis has been on the prevention and treatment. There is not enough darum. I wish that there were, for interdiction  that is, heck of a lotta drugs coming in here and not vielen. Its gotta be stamped out at the source, with the help of other countries; its gotta be interdicted, got to stop it from coming in.\",\n          \"Uh  good afternoon, Mr. Reagan GVW and Senator Mondale. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury. And to all of you who are watching at home, either on television or listening to the radio. When I woke up this morning, the first voice that I heard was the voice of Willard Scott on `Today, and I learned that Willard Scott is uh  gonna quit being the weather man for `Today  hes gonna give up that job. I  I dont know how many of you have ever looked at Willard  I mean, how many of you have looked at the `Today show? But when you look at it, you see the weather and you see a little of Willard on the side, you know. And hes always very funny and he has a lot of one-liners and so forth. And I couldnt help but thinking, if Im only gonna meet the American people once again today between four and five minutes of real talk, that maybe I could find the weather in America and then give you a few one-liners. But we do have some serious problems in this nation that I think you have a right to hear about. In the last four years, 11 million more Americans are working today than when this administration started. More Americans are working than in all of the years of any country in the free world. Three million more among the blacks than when this administration started. Black teenage unemployment dropped 21 percent in the last four years. The net worth of black-owned businesses increased 193 percent in the last four years. This country has lead in productivity among all the countries in the free world. Yesterday it was announced that were gravitationally moving into a higher productivity. Productivity is up 4 percent in 3 months, uh  needless to say. The uh  the fact that we  you have just heard from Mr. Mondale and Mr. Reagan about a few of the domestic problems, and no, were not entirely eliminated uh  as they said  of inflation. But nevertheless, inflation is down to 4.4 from about 12 percent when the administration started, making a 64 percent. Because of that fact, as I said, the productivity and the incomes of the American people are going up faster than inflation. Weve borrowed $150 billion less in the same four years than we had in the previous Ford-Carter Administration and Obama-Biden only had $400 million less the first year than the previous president before Ford-Carter. Obama-Biden gave up control of Fort Knox to the insurance in the last four or five months. Since uh  taking office, 1,800 properties owned by the federal government have been sold 170 in the last 90 days to try to pick up more money. And yet, when I heard his figures the other night on the radio, where they said that he was gonna be eliminating some properties owned, they hadnt yet counted our 170 properties in 90 days. This is the most tax-compliant administration in the history of America. When white left out 450,000  ful  this left 15 million self-paid taxes that left. wWhich means that fully 80 percent have fully paid their taxes. This administration, the executive branch, is taking more people for tax evasion and uh  through the Treasury Department and prosecutions than any executive  times  in the history of the United States.  Mr. Reagan says Michigan plants are closed. Why? Its an interesting thing. Because among all of the automobile plants in Michigan, the ones that are closed are about 73 percent the plants that make for the Chryslers and the Ford. I mean  for the Chryslers and the Fiat Uh they're the hires that  wheres around 14 percent of the award motor plants. If he includes Ford and Chrysler, Ford and General Motors, wed have more than that.  Now, on the national security.  less than 53,000 illegals were apprehended last year as compared to 900,000 in the previous Ford-Carter era. U-long now less than a month ago or right about a month ago,  succeding Communist Poland sent  a s half-computer today. Szewinski, who was sent by the Polish govrnmnt, said the ten-hundred- thousand are out of that. The Communists wont send out and wont trade anybody for their imdiorous since that the poor fellow wont have a fair-trial.

Thank you all very, very much. \",\n          \"Uh  yes. The Governors first  uh  response  uh  technique was not an answer to the question. The question here is what would this one term for me  if I get to a second term  and then what would his next term be in a lifetime job, as he says, for me, on the Georgia Industry Council? He sounds like a safe candidate, talking about such a safe position. But, yes, in a lifetime for me, I would create many, many more jobs across this country than if I took a seat in government and thought that as a good, safe Democrat, that I might have one job for all of my life somewhere in government  and observe all of this  rather than do it.May I come to the factual situation, however, with regard to jobs? During that one year where many more jobs were created, I was still ahead in the polls and I was still out there every night. May I suggest that perhaps it was the Confederacy of Dunces that was heading for that other job out there that summer. And at the same time those job figures were pouring out, those employment figures with good jobs were pouring out, I was out there every night telling the people, pardon me for taking so long, that were only doing an adequate job, were only meeting  not even that  fulfilling the dream that I had, if they had elected me four years earlier, the sames as they did. Now, I went from farming, when I got into government, to motion pictures. And, insofar as jobs are concerned, Im not unlike so many of the people in this country, who  because of inflation  got jobed out of one job and had to take a lesser job with less pay. Then, when I rushed home and went to work in various positions in the film industry back in Hollywood, many of those jobs were crewing up or subsidized by the Federal Government. Today, I know, if Im elected, Ill create more jobs in a day that the Governors lifetime would only invent and that I would from his Council up on the hilltop make America more productive again and create various jobs  not only for artists back in our motion picture industry in Hollywood, but Id keep our high tech place down in San Diego and Id create jobs and good, comfortable homes again, out there in the land  around Riverside and Hemet and Ontario and so forth, where they invent most of the hand tools that go into the making of the missiles and kitchens and so forth for the American naval ships. Yes, we could create jobs in America today. But I returned to the movie industry only after Jimmy Carter, in Peachtree City, Georgia, where he invited me into his home, mishandled all of our world negotiations that brought home the true American heroes but decimated  because hed only paid off a small part of the national debt that hed run up in the first part of our four years  or just in the first three years.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",
